pomt-04906	Says U.S. Senate opponent Eric Hovde "supported billions in stimulus for high-speed rail" and "billions more to bail out banks."	half-true	/wisconsin/statements/2012/aug/03/mark-neumann/fellow-gop-senate-candidate-eric-hovde-backed-bill/	According to polls, support for Wisconsin U.S. Senate candidate Eric Hovde is strongest among tea party supporters and the most conservative voters. Yet, in a July 17, 2012 TV ad, there’s a smiling Hovde, a Republican, pictured alongside a smiling President Barack Obama. The ad is from fellow GOP candidate Mark Neumann, who has stepped up his attacks on Hovde as the Aug. 14, 2012 primary approaches. "Like Barack Obama," the ad says, "Hovde supported billions in stimulus for high-speed rail and, like Obama, billions more to bail out banks." It ends stating that Hovde is "too liberal" with "your money." With the comparison to Obama -- whose policies Hovde has sharply criticized -- Neumann tries to portray Hovde as a backer of big government. Let’s see just how much support Hovde voiced for spending billions for high-speed trains and to bail out troubled banks. High-speed rail To back the high-speed rail part of Neumann’s claim, Neumann campaign manager Chip Englander cited the November 2008 edition of Hovde Industry Update, a newsletter published by one of Hovde’s financial services companies. The publication date is important in understanding the context of what the newsletter says. Even before Obama took office in January 2009, he was working with Democratic congressional leaders on an economic stimulus plan. What emerged, in February 2009, was a nearly $790 billion bill that included $282 billion in tax relief and $507 billion in spending, with about $48 billion for the Department of Transportation. (The estimate of the bill’s total cost has since been raised to $840 billion.) The newsletter -- all eight pages were devoted to one article -- was headlined: "Welcome to the government spending bubble." But far from welcoming government spending, the newsletter’s first paragraph ends with a warning: "At the core of these problems" in the U.S. financial system "is the toxic mix of Wall Street and Washington, which first led to the Internet bubble, then to the credit and housing bubble, and now to what may become a governmental spending bubble at the worst possible time." The newsletter goes on at length to criticize actions by the Federal Reserve Board and the U.S. Treasury in banking. Then it turns to the stimulus, saying the stimulus "needs to achieve the maximum effect and to address the root causes of this (financial) crisis." High-speed rail comes into play when the newsletter suggests stimulus money should be focused on "targeted federal infrastructure projects": "Again, building high-speed, light rail systems on the East and West coasts would stimulate job creation, increase productivity for those people and companies that transact business up and down the coastlines, and vastly reduce fuel consumption, as more people opt to use mass transit rather than drive their own automobile. Obviously, achieving a material reduction in oil demand would help attack this country’s single greatest cause of our massive trade and capital account deficits. Lastly, these programs would provide tangible, long-lasting benefits to society." Hovde doesn’t mention spending billions, but it’s easy to see that even a single high-speed rail project on either coast could cost that much. The proposed Milwaukee-to-Madison high-speed line spurned by Gov. Scott Walker had been slated for $810 million in federal funds. And the $48 billion in stimulus received by the federal DOT included $8 billion for high-speed and "inter-city rail programs." When we asked for a response from Hovde, his campaign spokesman, Sean Lansing, cited a July 2012 interview Hovde did with a Green Bay TV station. Hovde said the claim that he supported billions for spending for high-speed rail was "totally false." But then he acknowledged his newsletter did say that "during the height of the financial crisis, if we feel it necessary to spend money on stimulus," the money could be spent on high-speed rail on the coasts. We also found that in a March 2009 interview with CNBC-TV’s "Squawk Box" program, Hovde noted that he had previously advocated for spending stimulus money on high-speed rail. So, at a point when it was clear there would be a stimulus bill, Hovde supported spending stimulus money on high-speed rail, which likely would involve billions of dollars. But Neumann’s ad leaves out vital context from the newsletter: That Hovde opposed the stimulus money. He was arguing if there were a stimulus, it should be spent on projects that make an impact, such as high-speed rail on the East Coast. The ad also skips past the fact that these comments were made before Hovde was a candidate, presenting them as if he is an unabashed booster of spending as part of his campaign. Bank bailouts To back the part of the claim that Hovde supported billions "to bail out banks," Englander cited a clip from a TV appearance in which Hovde says: "Without question, I was an advocate from the get-go to inject capital into the banking system." This has some similar problems. The clip comes from an earlier interview Hovde did on "Squawk Box," in November 2008, about TARP, the Troubled Asset Relief Program. It was signed into law the previous month by President George W. Bush. Criticized by some Republicans as a bailout, the law authorized the U.S. Treasury to spend up to $700 billion to stabilize financial markets. Hovde criticized TARP for several minutes, though he said "something needed to be done." Then one of the hosts asked him: "Didn’t the government do something right by preventing the financial market from collapsing, by preventing the banking system from collapsing at some point?" Hovde replied with the part of the quote that Neumann cites, then said more: "Without question, I was an advocate from the get-go to inject capital into the banking system. But you should've done it on terms that were a little bit more punitive and required them to access private capital along with it, as well as putting the government's money -- taxpayer money -- in the most senior position." He added: "If they would have structured it properly and forced the banks to go to the private sector, there was a lot of private sector money that, on the right terms, would have come in. And, yes, we needed to stabilize the system." In response, Hovde spokesman Lansing again cited the July 2012 Green Bay TV interview. Asked if he supported billions to bail out banks, Hovde said: "I have been opposed to that from Day One." He said he had written and given interviews in 2008 asserting that, "if we needed to give money to these companies, then executives should have been replaced and the cost of the capital should have been higher." Like the high-speed rail part of Neumann’s claim, Neumann’s ad takes a partial statement and ignores critical context. It further muddies things by comparing Hovde to Obama, when the TARP proposal in question was done under Bush. On the other hand, Neumann’s ad didn’t say Hovde supported TARP but rather that he supported billions to bail out banks. Hovde did express support for a taxpayer-funded bailout, albeit with an approach he asserted would better protect taxpayers. Our rating Neumann compared Hovde to Obama, saying Hovde "supported billions in stimulus for high-speed rail" and "billions more to bail out banks." Hovde was critical of the stimulus plan, but did back high-speed rail as a spending option when it was clear the stimulus program would be created. Similarly, Hovde didn’t back TARP, as the ad implies, but did favor taxpayer assistance provided in a different way. Neumann’s claim is partially accurate, but takes Hovde’s statements out of context -- our definition of Half True.

An outfit called Stranger Than Fiction News posted a video on its Facebook page Oct. 25. Over footage of a group of masked protestors burning an American flag, the post has the bold news headline "‘MAGA bomber’ identified as former CNN employee who donated to heavily to Hillary Clinton." (The video matches an antifa flag burning in Portland, Ore.) The video had over 30,000 views, and if the comments are any guide, it reached a receptive audience. Comments included "The Democratic Party is a terrorist organization," and "The fake pipe bomb fiasco that has gripped America for the last two days is rapidly unraveling as a political hoax." A couple of people asked "Is this for real?" To which we say, no. This is pure, 100 percent certified fake news. The FBI’s latest statement (as of the time we published) says only that an 11th package was recovered in Florida, addressed to Sen. Cory Booker, D-N.J. There’s been no announcement of any suspects, much less a person with ties to CNN or the campaign of Hillary Clinton. Stranger Than Fiction News also promotes the false story of crisis actors who pretend to be grieving survivors after gun massacres . Take this as your daily dose of Pants on Fire fake news.

pomt-08882	Says President Barack Obama initially said the national health-care mandate isn't a tax, but his administration now says it is a tax.	mostly true	/texas/statements/2010/aug/02/republican-party-texas/republican-party-texas-says-president-barack-obama/	Channeling U.S. Rep Joe Wilson, the Republican from South Carolina who shouted "You lie!" during President Barack Obama's speech to Congress in September, the Republican Party of Texas has accused the president of lying when he said that a new federal mandate requiring individuals to have health insurance was not a tax. "You lie!" the party tweeted July 19. "Obama said O-care mandate wasn't a tax. Now Obama admin says it is a tax." Did the Obama administration talk one way and then the other? Per the legislation that Obama signed into law in March, most people will be required to have health insurance starting in 2014. There are exceptions, but individuals who aren't exempt and refuse to join a plan will be required to pay an annual penalty of $695 per person, up to a maximum of $2,085 per family, or 2.5 percent of household income, whichever is greater. The health care law calls the fine individuals must pay if they don't have insurance a "penalty." In a Sept. 20, 2009, interview with ABC's George Stephanopoulos, Obama denied that the mandate to buy health insurance was equivalent to a tax. "For us to say that you've got to take a responsibility to get health insurance is absolutely not a tax increase," Obama said. He noted that Americans are required to have auto insurance, but nobody considers that a tax increase. (Auto insurance is a state mandate, but all the states except New Hampshire require it of resident drivers.) When Stephanopoulos pressed Obama on whether the mandate was a tax, Obama said: "I absolutely reject that notion." However, on July 16 The New York Times published a story that seemed to vindicate opponents of the health care overhaul who argued that the insurance requirement was a tax. The headline: "Changing stance, administration now defends insurance mandate as a tax." Texas is one of 21 states challenging the law's constitutionality in court, but Virginia was the first to face the federal government in a July 1 hearing on its lawsuit. The New York Times pointed to a brief filed in that case by the U.S. Department of Justice defending the individual mandate as "a valid exercise" of the federal government's "power to lay and collect taxes." Congress can impose taxes to provide for the "general welfare" under Article I of the Constitution. From the health-care law: "The requirement regulates activity that is commercial and economic in nature: economic and financial decisions about how and when health care is paid for, and when health insurance is purchased." The law then says that national health spending is projected to increase from $2.5 trillion — 17.6 percent of the economy — in 2009, to $4.7 trillion in 2019. In its legal brief, the department says the penalty is also a tax because it will raise revenue — $4 billion a year by 2017, according to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office — and because it's imposed and collected under the Internal Revenue Code. Individuals who refuse to obtain health insurance and are penalized will have to report the fine "as an addition to income tax liability," the brief says. The health care law itself doesn't mention Congress' taxing authority, instead noting that the mandate is protected under the Constitution's Article I "commerce clause," which lets Congress regulate commercial activity that has a substantial effect on the national economy. "The tax argument is the strongest argument," the Times quoted Jack Balkin, a professor at Yale Law School who supports the law, saying. "This bill is a tax. Because it's a tax, it's completely constitutional." Balkin is also quoted saying that Obama "has not been honest with the American people about the nature of the bill." White House spokesman Matt Lehrich defended the law both ways last week, telling us: "We believe that the Commerce Clause provides ample constitutional authority for the individual mandate. If anyone has any doubts about that — and we don’t think they should — it’s also clear that that the mandate is constitutional under Congress’s power to tax." Similarly, Steven Schwinn, an associate professor of constitutional law at the John Marshall Law School in Chicago, pointed out on his blog July 18 that the Obama administration has consistently defended the mandate in court primarily under the Commerce Clause, and secondarily under Congress' taxing power to promote the general welfare. Henry Aaron, a scholar who specializes in health care and tax policy at the liberal-leaning Brookings Institution, said Obama was correct to say the mandate isn't a tax. "A mandate is meaningless unless it is backed up by some 'or else,' as in 'obey the mandate or else,' " Aaron said. "The administration asserted the legal power to impose a mandate. The mandate is backed up by a tax that has to be paid if the mandate is violated. You obey the mandate or you pay the tax." Upshot: In his interview with Stephanopoulos, Obama insisted the mandate to purchase health coverage is not a tax. But in defending its legality, the Justice Department argues in part that the mandate is a valid exercise of Congress' taxing power. From where we sit, Obama was trying to make a political point; the Justice Department, a legal one. In its tweet, the Republican Party overreaches when it says the administration now calls the mandate a tax. The administration (still) isn't doing that. But it does cite Congress' power to levy taxes as authority for the mandate. And that enables the GOP to score its own political point, based on what looks like the administration's runs at having it both ways. We rate the GOP's recap of Obama's early position and his administration's recent defense of the law as Mostly True.

pomt-01503	Jason Carter "actually opposed more funding for education in the Senate."	mostly true	/georgia/statements/2014/sep/24/republican-governors-association/attack-mostly-target-carter-opposed-education-fund/	The too-close-to-call race between Republican incumbent Nathan Deal and Democratic challenger Jason Carter has the Republican Governors Association plunking down more money in Georgia. The RGA has already spent $1.6 million on Georgia’s governor’s race and is upping its investment with a new ad that started airing Tuesday in most parts of the state. The association has previously taken to the airwaves in Georgia to attack Carter, a state senator from Atlanta, as a "liberal trial lawyer" and a champion of expanding Medicaid as part of Obamacare. The new 30-second challenges one of Carter’s biggest campaign promises -- his vow to improve education funding. "Jason Carter promises to invest more in education. But Carter actually opposed more funding for education in the Senate," the ad states. That’s a frequent claim out of the Deal campaign. It’s also very similar to a claim that PolitiFact has examined previously and deems worthy of a second look -- given that education is one of the hottest topics in the race and one of taxpayers’ biggest investment. (This year alone, the cost of K-12 education is $7.9 billion, or 43.4 percent of the state’s $18.3 billion budget.) The ad from the Republican Governors Association specifically takes aim at Carter’s vote in the most recent General Assembly session on the 2015 state budget (though the RGA gives a wrong citation in the ad for HB 744, the 2015 appropriations bill). Out of 56 state senators, Carter was one of only four who voted "No" on the budget," state records show. The budget included austerity cuts to education, totaling $747 million. But they were the smallest cuts since 2009 and, as such, were viewed by leaders in education as largely positive. This past spring, when Deal signed the 2015 budget into law, Carter explained his opposition was rooted in a belief that having a separate education budget would restore all, not just some, of the previous cuts. "Budgets reflect values, and this budget shows that Gov. Deal does not value our students, teachers and classrooms," Carter said in a statement in April. Carter has since expanded on his idea of a separate education budget, including a questionable funding stream from tax cheats to boost spending. Republicans argued that Deal increased education funding every year, a claim PolitiFact found overstated his record. On the campaign trail, Carter has repeatedly attacked Deal for underfunding education. Most of his public statements as a state senator focused on education and called for more money, both on the K-12 and college levels. "To say he does not support more funding is completely erroneous," Carter spokesman Bryan Thomas said. "It’s precisely the opposite. He does not want our schools to continue to be shortchanged." Republicans, however, have suggested that Carter’s vote against the 2015 budget was strictly political posturing. They point out that he voted in favor of Deal’s three prior state budgets, all of which had larger education austerity cuts. (Georgia’s 180 school systems collectively were underfunded more than $1.1 billion in 2012, $1.1 billion in 2013 and nearly $1.1 billion in 2014, according to allotment sheets from the Georgia Department of Education.) Austerity cuts reflect the difference in what school systems qualify for and actually receive from the state under the education funding formula, the Quality Basic Education Act of 1985. Carter has voiced concerns about the state’s commitment to public education during his short Senate career. His criticism, specifically of Deal on education, has sharpened in recent months, with his campaign manager at one point calling Deal Georgia’s worst education governor. (See PolitiFact’s Pants On Fire ruling of that claim.) Around the nation, there are 36 governor’s races this fall and about a third of them -- including the one between Deal and Carter -- are considered competitive, said Larry Sabato, director of the University of Virginia Center for Politics. "Deal is one of five incumbent Republicans who is in some degree of difficulty," Sabato said. "Deal is a slight favorite, but Carter has kept it close." In summary, the RGA ad claims that Carter "actually opposed more funding for education." It would be accurate to say Carter voted against the current state budget that expanded money for schools. Carter has called for more education funding for nearly all of his short political career. But when it came down to votes in the state Senate, he voted with Gov. Deal on three budgets that contained austerity cuts and against the governor on a budget that had the smallest austerity cuts in years. The GOP was careful in wording its latest ad to say Carter opposed more funding for education "in the Senate." That statement needs that context but is largely on target. We rate the claim Mostly True.	None	Republican Governors Association	None	None	None	2014-09-24T00:00:00	2014-09-23	['None']
pomt-12491	Says of the GOP health care proposal, "pre-existing conditions are in the bill."	mostly false	/florida/statements/2017/may/01/donald-trump/does-new-version-ahca-still-cover-pre-existing-con/	President Donald Trump remains hopeful that he can deliver on his promise to repeal the Affordable Care Act and replace it with a plan from the Republican Party. In an interview with CBS’ Face the Nation, Trump argued that the GOP’s health care plan covers pre-existing conditions, despite what news reports have said. "Pre-existing conditions are in the bill," Trump said April 30. "And I just watched another network than yours, and they were saying, ‘Pre-existing is not covered.’ Pre-existing conditions are in the bill. And I mandate it. I said, ‘Has to be.’ " Trump was more than likely referring to the most recent version of the GOP health care overhaul, an amendment by U.S. Rep. Tom MacArthur, R-N.J., introduced in late April. "This bill is much different than it was a little while ago, okay? This bill has evolved," Trump said. "But we have now pre-existing conditions in the bill. We've set up a pool for the pre-existing conditions so that the premiums can be allowed to fall." When CBS’ John Dickerson pressed Trump on whether everyone with pre-existing conditions would be covered, Trump said, "We actually have a clause that guarantees." White House spokesman Sean Spicer said at the May 1 news briefing that Trump was referring to the MacArthur amendment and that Trump is ensuring that "coverage of pre-existing conditions is at the core" of the legislation. But the reality of how the bill addresses pre-existing conditions -- which are health problems patients have before new insurance kicks in -- is much more complicated than Trump makes it sound. What the amendment says on pre-existing conditions In March, the Republican’s American Health Care Act died without a vote when Republicans couldn’t agree on the bill designed to replace the Affordable Care Act. Under the new bill, called ACHA, insurers had to cover pre-existing conditions, but they could have charged more for people who are recently uninsured. The MacArthur amendment would allow states to obtain waivers to some requirements of the Affordable Care Act, including the "essential health benefits" provision that requires maternity care or mental health services. The amendment has language that appears to protect those with pre-existing conditions stating that "nothing in this Act shall be construed as permitting insurers to limit access to health coverage for individuals with pre-existing conditions." But experts say other parts of the amendment suggest that those with pre-existing conditions could struggle to maintain affordable health insurance. The amendment permits insurers to set premiums based on the "health status" of an individual by looking at their current and past health status and make predictions about how much an individual will use medical care in the future, said Linda Blumberg, senior fellow in the Health Policy Center at the Urban Institute. That’s where pre-existing conditions could come into play, because it would mean that the costs rise for consumers who are sicker, said Timothy Jost, Washington and Lee University School of Law emeritus professor. "Health status underwriting is literally charging a higher (possibly much, unaffordably, higher) premium to people with pre-existing conditions," Jost said. "Under the MacArthur amendment, they could not be refused coverage, but insurers could impose high enough premiums that coverage would be unaffordable." The amendment says that the waiver would allow states to set up a high-risk pool or participate in a new federal invisible risk-sharing program to help states reimburse insurers for covering high-risk consumers. "No state may obtain a waiver for health status unless it has taken these efforts to protect those who might be affected," stated a MacArthur press release. "In states with a waiver, individuals who maintain continuous coverage could not be rated based on health status." That means people who stay insured without any lapses can’t be charged more by insurance companies if they get sick. But experts said that many low-income people aren’t able to stay covered without breaks, and that questions remain about the effectiveness of the high-risk pools. The American Medical Association, which opposes the amendment, said in a statement that it "could make coverage unaffordable for people with pre-existing conditions." The AMA raised questions about whether the high-risk pool would be "sufficient to provide for affordable health insurance or prevent discrimination against individuals with certain high-cost medical conditions." Our ruling Trump said of the GOP health care amendment, "Pre-existing conditions are in the bill." The amendment says that health insurers can’t limit access to coverage for people with pre-existing conditions, but that insurers can charge people more if states agree. In some states, health insurers would be able to charge sicker people more. And experts warn that high-risk pools -- the mechanisms meant to keep premiums lower for sick people -- might not be effective. Overall, the latest proposal seems to weaken existing protections for people with pre-existing conditions, not strengthen them. We rate the statement Mostly False.

pomt-08370	"More private-sector jobs were created in the first eight months of 2010 than in the eight years of the Bush administration."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/oct/25/nancy-pelosi/nancy-pelosi-says-more-private-sector-jobs-created/	House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif. -- who is in danger of losing her leadership position if the Republicans take over the House -- must really like the following talking point, because she's used it at least twice on national television in recent days. "More private-sector jobs were created in the first eight months of 2010 than in the eight years of the Bush administration," she said in an interview on MSNBC's Countdown with Keith Olbermann on Oct. 21, 2010. The day before, Pelosi said something virtually identical in an interview on PBS' Charlie Rose Show. We thought we'd check to see if she's correct. We turned to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the federal agency that tracks employment numbers. According to the BLS website, there were 111,634,000 Americans employed in the private sector at the start of George W. Bush's first term, in January 2001. Eight years later, in January 2009, there were 110,961,000 Americans employed in the private sector. So the United States lost 673,000 private-sector jobs on Bush's watch. That makes it easy for Pelosi: If the United States netted even one private-sector job in 2010, she'd be accurate. And the nation actually did quite a bit better than that. Private-sector employment in January 2010 was 107,123,000, a number that grew to 107,970,000 by Septmeber 2010. That works out to be 847,000 jobs created. So Pelosi's statement is accurate. But it's also a classic case of cherry-picking -- for two reasons. First, Pelosi carefully cited private-sector employment, not total employment. There's a valid reason to focus on private-sector jobs rather than government jobs, since private-sector jobs produce income-boosting goods and services to a degree that government jobs do not. Still, choosing private-sector jobs helps Pelosi's case in a crucial way: If she'd chosen total employment instead, her formulation would have been wrong. Total employment -- that is, the combination of private- and public-sector jobs -- during Bush's tenure increased by 1.08 million, while total employment in 2010 has increased by 599,000. (Quick aside: Who would have thought that federal and state government jobs would have increased by 1.7 million in eight years under Bush and fallen by 357,000 since President Barack Obama took office?) Second, Pelosi chose her start and end dates in a way that's highly favorable to Obama and unfavorable to Bush. If she'd instead chosen to start from the beginning of Obama's term -- rather than half way through his first two years -- she would be stuck with a net loss of nearly 3 million private-sector jobs, not the increase of 847,000 she came up with for 2010. Pelosi essentially started counting from the low point for jobs and only counted the upward part of the trendline. Meanwhile, the start and end points she used for Bush give the former president no such break. The jobs picture under Bush looked like an arc, heading generally upward through mid 2007 before heading downward again. If she had used only the upward portion of the arc, as she did for Obama, it would have showed a gain of 3.9 million private-sector jobs. You could argue that it's unfair to pin the blame on Obama for job losses early in his tenure. Still, Pelosi drew the lines for her comparison as artfully as state legislatures have been known to draw lines defining congressional districts, and, similarly, Pelosi's choices are not just highly selective but also beneficial to her side. To be fair, Pelosi's staff points out that they have not shied from showing the full arc of the jobs numbers since Obama took office, attaching a fact sheet showing both the decline and rise in jobs since Obama's inauguration. But her televised comments don't reflect that. To fully understand the jobs comparison Pelosi makes, you need to understand how she sliced and diced the numbers.

pomt-07783	If Wisconsin's governor cuts perquisites as much as he plans to do, "it would still leave (workers) better off than their private sector" counterparts.	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/feb/21/george-will/george-will-says-wisconsin-governors-benefits-prop/	With national attention focused on a showdown in Wisconsin over Gov. Scott Walker's proposal to reduce state worker benefits, the issue led to some spirited back-and-forth between union-backer Donna Brazile and conservative columnist George Will during the round-table discussion on ABC's This Week. Brazile called the workers who have flooded the state capitol to back union workers an "organic movement." "Just like the Tea Party went out there and grabbed the microphone, what you have is grassroots people out there saying, 'No more,' no more budget cuts on the back of working people." Brazile said. Will responded, "Donna, what you call the grassroots is a tiny minority of this tiny minority of Wisconsin people who work for the government. Three hundred thousand public employees in Wisconsin went to work -- while the teachers were clutching their little signs that say it's all about the kids, they're abandoning their classrooms, lying to their supervisors, saying they were sick, and going off to protest in defense of perquisites, which if the governor cuts them as much as he plans to do, would still leave them better off than their private sector" counterparts. We decided to check Will's claim that perks or non-wage compensation such as health and retirement benefits) -- if cut as much as Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker has proposed -- would still leave public employees "better off" than those in the private sector. Walker's plan would require state workers to pay 5.8 percent of their pension contributions and to double their share of health premiums to 12.6 percent. Our colleagues at PolitiFact Wisconsin have been all over many of the issues in this contentious debate, and back on Feb. 8, they fact-checked a claim Gov. Walker made in his first "state of the state" address, that most state employees could pay twice as much toward their health care premiums, and it would still be half the national average. Here's some of what our friends at PolitiFact Wisconsin found: * A Kaiser Family Foundation study that concluded that employees nationally -- public and private -- pay an average of 29 percent of the cost of the premiums. Among just state and government workers nationwide, the average was 25 percent for family coverage. * A U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics 2010 health care benefits survey that put the employee share at 32 percent for family coverage. It’s 21 percent for single coverage. * A study by The Segal Co., a private benefits firm, that looked just at state government workers and found that a majority pay between 20 percent and 60 percent of their premium costs for family coverage. In other words, no matter how you slice it, the 12.6 percent share of health care premiums that Walker proposes employees pay is well below what most pay in the private -- and public -- sectors. That gets us halfway there. The second piece is pensions. Again, Walker's plan would require state workers to pay 5.8 percent of pension contributions. This one is a little more difficult to compare. Most public employees have a pension plan. But fewer than one in five private-sector employees has access to a pension plan. And those who do typically don't contribute anything to it. Much more often, private employees have access to employer-sponsored retirement benefits (such as 401(k) plans), rather than pensions. And a third of the private sector workforce has no access to an employer sponsored retirement plan at all. "The 401(k) has become the de facto retirement benefit in the private sector," said Keith Brainard, research director for the National Association of State Retirement Administrators. Typically, Brainard said, employers will match about 3 percent to 5 percent of an employee's salary. Employees may contribute to their 401(k), but they aren't required to contribute. So Wisconsin public employees may be required to contribute more to the their retirement plan than those in the private sector, but that doesn't mean they're at a disadvantage compared to the private sector. In fact, experts say they will be better off. According to a survey prepared by Brainard in October 2009, "The retirement security of working Americans presently appears shaky outside the public sector, due not only to the nation’s heavy use of a retirement plan model that has been found to be undependable in its ability to provide reliable retirement income, but also due to low relative rates of participation in employer-sponsored retirement plans. " Conversely, "For most states and local governments, retirement security of retired workers is a policy that is being achieved." As always, Brainard said, there are exceptions, such as for those government employees who don't work long enough to become vested in a pension. But Will's comment, as it relates to pension is "largely accurate," Brainard said. "Overall, the retirement plan typically provided to Wisconsin public employees --whether or not they are contributing 5.8 percent -- provides a larger retirement benefit than private sector employees get." We'd like to cite one more survey, one by the Wisconsin Legislative Council which found that even among major public employee retirement systems, most required employee contributions of more than 5 percent. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, "for government workers with a required plan contribution, the average contribution is 6.3 percent of earnings." So Walker's proposal is in line with the norm for government workers. Now, we'd like to drop one big disclaimer into this whole analysis. Many experts contend that while state workers get better benefits, they get paid less than folks in the private sector. PolitiFact Wisconsin took a closer look at that issue here. The point is that it's important to consider an employee's total package of wages and benefits when comparing public and private sector compensation. But that's not the issue before us here. Will clearly stated that he was talking about just the benefits side of the equation. And with regard to the changes Walker has proposed -- requiring greater employee contributions to pension and health care -- Will is right that they would still leave public employees "better off" than those in the private sector. We rate Will's comment True.	None	George Will	None	None	None	2011-02-21T18:55:11	2011-02-20	['Wisconsin']
pomt-10241	On support for the Bridge to Nowhere.	full flop	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/sep/01/sarah-palin/as-candidate-yes-as-governor-no/	Shortly after being introduced as Sen. John McCain's vice presidential running mate, Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin sought to bolster her credibility as a crusader against wasteful spending, saying, "I told Congress, 'Thanks, but no thanks,' on that bridge to nowhere." We ruled that statement only Half True. Yes, we noted, Palin formally nixed plans for a nearly $400-million Alaska bridge project to connect the tiny city of Ketchikan to Gravina, an island with just a few dozen residents and an airport. The project was derisively nicknamed the Bridge to Nowhere by a government watchdog group and became a national symbol of federal pork-barrel spending. Long before Palin killed the project, Congress washed its hands of the bridge. In the transportation spending bill that included money for the Ketchikan bridge, Congress deleted the wording that would have directed money for the project, though it left the money in place so Alaska officials could decide which transportation projects to spend it on. As a result, Alaska diverted much of the $223-million from the federal government to other projects, leaving the Ketchikan-Gravina bridge project woefully underfunded, and with no prospect of additional federal funding. That was the point at which Palin formally killed the bridge project. Several of our readers wrote to us saying we were too generous with our ruling, that Palin had flip-flopped on the issue, at one time supporting the bridge before later opposing it. We think that's a separate matter, and so we'll address it here. While running for governor in September 2006, Palin assured the Ketchikan Chamber of Commerce she was all for the bridge. "The money that's been appropriated for the project, it should remain available for a link, an access process as we continue to evaluate the scope and just how best to just get this done," Palin said then, according to a story in the Ketchikan Daily News . "This link is a commitment to help Ketchikan expand its access, to help this community prosper." "I think we're going to make a good team as we progress that bridge project," she told the audience. And in a written questionnaire for the Anchorage Daily News the following month, October of 2006, Palin was asked directly, "Would you continue state funding for the proposed Knik Arm and Gravina Island bridges?" Her answer: "Yes. I would like to see Alaska's infrastructure projects built sooner rather than later. The window is now — while our congressional delegation is in a strong position to assist." Palin's position began to shift once she became governor, however. Palin took over as governor in December 2006 and in February 2007 her proposed state budget didn't include state funding for the Ketchikan bridge. A spokesman noted that Palin's proposed capital budget focused on projects that could draw federal money, too. At that point, according to the Ketchikan Daily News , the cost of the bridge had risen $67-million and former Gov. Frank Murkowski had recommended putting $195-million in the state budget for Ketchikan's bridge. In defending the change of position this week, Palin campaign spokeswoman Maria Comella said Palin "acted like a responsible and effective executive. After taking office and examining the project closely, she consistently opposed funding the 'Bridge to Nowhere' and ultimately canceled the wasteful project." It's true that on Sept. 21, 2007, Palin officially killed the project. "Ketchikan desires a better way to reach the airport, but the $398-million bridge is not the answer," Palin said in a prepared statement. "Despite the work of our congressional delegation, we are about $329-million short of full funding for the bridge project, and it's clear that Congress has little interest in spending any more money on a bridge between Ketchikan and Gravina Island." But she wasn't sounding like someone who opposed the project as wasteful either. "Much of the public's attitude toward Alaska bridges is based on inaccurate portrayals of the projects here," Palin said. "But we need to focus on what we can do, rather than fight over what has happened." So the question here is whether Palin flipped positions on the project, or conceded to the political reality that opposition had become too strong against it. Without further support from Congress, Alaska would have had to shoulder most of the cost itself. Palin's quotes about the project this week seem to suggest she opposed the project. "I've championed reform to end the abuses of earmarked spending by Congress," Palin said at a joint appearance with McCain in Washington, Pa., on Aug. 30. "And I did tell Congress, thanks but no thanks for that bridge to nowhere. If our state wanted to build a bridge, we were going to build it ourselves." McCain said Palin has "stopped government from wasting taxpayers' money on things they don't want or need. And when we in Congress decided to build a bridge in Alaska to nowhere for $233-million of yours, she said, we don't want it. If we need it, we'll build our own in Alaska. She's the one that stood up to them." Nevermind that Alaska didn't give the money back. It spent the money on other transportation projects. The context of Palin's and McCain's recent statements suggest Palin flagged the so-called Bridge to Nowhere project as wasteful spending. But that's not the tune she was singing when she was running for governor, particularly not when she was standing before the Ketchikan Chamber of Commerce asking for their vote. And so, we rate Palin's position a Full Flop.	None	Sarah Palin	None	None	None	2008-09-01T00:00:00	2008-08-30	['None']
pomt-08880	A bill to cap carbon emissions "could cost Ohio 100,000 jobs."	mostly false	/ohio/statements/2010/aug/02/rob-portman/portman-uses-outdated-context-claim-cap-and-trade-/	The only thing better than accusing an opponent of losing jobs in Ohio’s hard-pressed economy is linking him or his party to proposals that might cause even higher Buckeye State unemployment. That’s what Rob Portman, the Republican running for U.S. Senate, attempts in a TV commercial that says a "job-killer" energy tax is "coming our way from Washington." "It could cost Ohio 100,000 jobs we cannot afford to lose," Portman says in the ad. Portman’s concern is shared by business leaders, especially manufacturers. But he nearly steers a legitimate concern off the rails with his 100,000 job-loss figure. The "energy tax" would come from a proposed bill to curb greenhouse gas emissions. Though the so-called cap-and-trade bill would not specifically impose a tax, it’s clear enough what Portman means. The bill would limit carbon emissions while creating a trading system so companies that cut their carbon output – by burning less coal, for instance – could sell their unneeded carbon credits. Companies that needed to exceed the caps could buy those credits. Unless there was generous help to companies in coal-reliant states like Ohio, a cap-and-trade bill could hurt, because there aren’t enough alternatives right now to coal-fired electricity. "The fact is that any carbon legislation is designed to make us not use coal," says Kevin Hassett, director of economic policy studies at the American Enterprise Institute, a conservative-leaning think tank in Washington. "So if you’re a state that has a lot of coal, you’re going to get hammered." Theoretically then, Portman’s broad fear is not off the mark, although various studies and analyses make conflicting claims. But Portman strays by claiming the cost could be 100,000 Ohio jobs, and by saying the bill "is coming our way." His job-loss figure comes from an analysis of a bill that the House of Representatives passed last year. Two problems: The analysis, from a study sponsored by the business-backed National Association of Manufacturers and the American Council of Capital Formation, predicted two potential outcomes. Ohio’s job losses by the year 2030 could range anywhere from 79,700 to 108,600, the study said. Yet Portman chose to go with a figure closest to the outside extreme. The bill he relies on in order to make the claim has stalled for a long time in the Senate with objections not only from Republicans but also from industrial-state Democrats like Ohio’s Sherrod Brown. Few people in Washington believe a broad cap-and-trade bill has a chance of passing, especially in an election year. "I sure wouldn’t want to bet the farm on it," says Stephen Hess, a senior fellow emeritus at the Brookings Institution, a centrist-liberal think tank. "I don’t think I’d even want to bet a weekend at Atlantic City." The House bill was sponsored by liberal members Edward Markey of Massachusetts and Henry Waxman of California. Senate Democrats don’t have enough of a majority to just rubber-stamp the Waxman-Markey bill, and Democrats like Brown are insisting on better economic protections for coal-reliant states. The campaign of Lee Fisher, Portman’s Democratic rival in the Senate race, says Fisher too believes the Waxman-Markey bill would harm Ohio unless it got better protections. That doesn’t mean a compromise cannot be fashioned, and several are on the table. One would require provisions to keep foreign manufacturers that don’t have carbon restrictions from gaining advantage and taking jobs from the United States. Another would grant extra carbon credits to keep companies in Ohio and similar states from paying too much while they transitioned to greener energy sources. Yet another, being considered as a separate bill that has President Barack Obama’s support, would create clean-energy manufacturing grants to help companies develop jobs in wind, solar and other alternative energy sources. Different interest groups, economists and lawmakers use different analyses to project the potential job losses or gains from these proposals. The Peterson Institute for International Economics said in May that a climate-change measure introduced by Sen. John Kerry, Democrat of Massachusetts, and Joe Lieberman, an independent from Connecticut, would prompt enough clean-energy investment in its first decade to add 203,000 new jobs nationally. But higher energy and product prices in the second decade would offset those job gains, the Peterson economists said. Economists at the University of California at Berkeley had a more optimistic take, saying that adoption of a House-style bill could add as many as 1.9 million jobs nationwide – with 35,000 to 61,000 of those in Ohio – by 2020. That is assuming that states have "balanced policies" that utilize not only a cap-and-trade system but also complementary policies for energy efficiency and clean technology, the authors said. For an additional take, we looked at a Congressional Budget Office analysis, published in May. The CBO examined three independent economic studies by outside groups: Brookings, Resources for the Future, and CRA International, a consulting firm. The CBO’s conclusion from these: Workers who rely on coal and other fossil fuels for their jobs would be affected, but eventually, most workers who lost jobs would find new ones. In particular, the CBO said, a "gradually increasing tax on greenhouse gas emissions," as envisioned in the Waxman-Markey bill, "would probably only have a small effect on total employment during the next few decades." The CBO did not quantify that, however. So we turned to the Bureau of Labor Statistics and took out our calculator. If 100,000 jobs were lost due to cap-and-trade, as Portman claims, that would represent a loss of anywhere from 2 percent to 2.4 percent of Ohio jobs, depending on how you measure today’s employment. That’s not a small effect – which would seem to put Portman’s claim at odds with the CBO’s analysis. A loss of 100,000 jobs "would be quite meaningful" in terms of overall Ohio employment, says Ken Mayfield, an economist and president of ClearView Economics of Pepper Pike. In his commercial, Portman couches his number by saying the state "could" lose that many jobs. And campaign spokeswoman Jessica Towhey says that Portman uses the 100,000 number because it comes from a legitimate study of the only cap-and-trade bill that has passed a chamber of Congress, making it more realistic than Senate proposals that are speculative for now. If Obama were to demand action, Towhey said, Senate Democrats could quickly line up in support and enact a final cap-and-trade bill. But the political roadblocks to Waxman-Markey in the Senate make its passage equally speculative -- unless there are concessions for states like Ohio. And Portman chose to use the worst-case conclusion on Waxman-Markey. In fact, last October another fact-checking outfit, Factcheck.org, affiliated with the University of Pennsylvania, did its own full review of the National Association of Manufacturers’ claim. It examined the national prediction rather than those for individual states, focusing on the claim that cap-and-trade could cost up to 2.4 million jobs. Factcheck.org turned to the same in-depth study by the Energy Information Administration, or EIA, that backers and detractors of Waxman-Markey were citing at the time. The EIA analyzed 11 different sets of assumptions, every one of which showed there would be fewer jobs in 2030 with the Waxman-Markey bill than without. But "only the most severely pessimistic set of assumptions" produced job losses on the scale cited by the manufacturers, and now repeated by Portman. And remember, that was the worst case scenario from two groups that tend to support big business’ side of the issue. That’s why we find Portman’s claim to be Barely True. Comment on this item. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.

pomt-00243	Says "On the Public Service Commission, (Kevin Cramer) raised his pay to over $93,650."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2018/oct/08/heidi-heitkamp/did-kevin-cramer-raise-his-own-salary-23000-no/	A new campaign ad in the North Dakota Senate race claims Republican contender Kevin Cramer gave himself a five-figure raise as a public official. "Could you give yourself a $23,000 raise?" the ad voiceover says. "Ask Kevin Cramer. On the Public Service Commission, he raised his pay to over $93,650." Cramer did get raises totalling that amount. But the ad completely distorts Cramer’s hand in securing the pay increase. The Public Service Commission has three commissioners who are elected to six-year terms. They regulate utilities, pipeline safety, telecommunications, railroads and other state services. Cramer joined the commission in August 2003. He served until the end of 2012, when he was elected to the U.S. House of Representatives. Commissioners’ salaries usually originate from the governor’s office, which works with the Office of Management and Budget to determine how much money is available for public officials, according to Jeff Larshus, director of state financial services at the OMB. The governor then submits a budget to the Legislative Assembly, which writes the salaries into statute and votes on their approval. So saying Cramer raised his own salary ignores the arbiter of that salary. The OMB proposed and received across the board salary hikes for elected officials every year between 2005 and 2012. These include the governor, lieutenant governor, secretary of state, attorney general, superintendent for public instruction, state auditor, state treasurer, and the tax, insurance, public service and agriculture commissioners. In 2005, they all got a 4 percent hike from their last salary number, determined in 2002. They got three more 4 percent hikes in 2006, 2007, and 2008, a 5 percent increase in 2009, another 5 percent increase in 2010, and then 3 percent in 2011 and again in 2012. While their salaries all differ, the percentage increases were equal across the board. That’s how Cramer’s salary jumped from $69,874 to $95,611 from the time he was elected to the time he left office — a $25,737 increase. "So did it go up considerably during that time frame?" Larshus said. "Yes. But it wasn’t because the commissioner asked for the salary." Commissioners submit a budget to the OMB every two years. There, they can suggest compensation for commissioners. But staff at the Public Service Commission and at the OMB said they could not recall an instance in which they had requested salary bumps for commissioners. The OMB had three of the four budget requests during which Cramer served and got salary hikes on file. Only one asked for equity funds to raise administrative staff salaries. But that does not include the commissioners, according to Jill Kringstad, Accounting Budget Specialist. She could not recall any instances where commissioners' salary increases were included in budget requests. The bottom line is that the legislative assembly needs to approve, write into law and vote on any proposed salaries for elected officials proposed by the OMB. These salary changes were all ultimately set by the legislature. Heitkamp’s office said Cramer could have refused to accept the raises or requested lower salary numbers to the OMB. The current governor had to change a North Dakota statute in order to fulfill his campaign promise to refuse pay. Our ruling Heitkamp said, "Could you give yourself a $23,000 raise? Ask Kevin Cramer. On the public service Commission, he raised his pay to over $93,650." Cramer’s salary increased by $25,737 during his tenure on the Public Service Commission. But he didn’t give himself that raise. The governor proposed it, the OMB drafted it, and the legislative assembly voted on its passage. The other 12 elected officials in North Dakota received the same percentage salary bump.

pomt-06398	"1.53 million jobs are at risk (from potential defense cuts)."	mostly true	/virginia/statements/2011/oct/29/randy-forbes/rep-randy-forbes-says-153-million-defense-jobs-are/	U.S. Rep. Randy Forbes, R-4th, is warning that potential cuts in defense spending would inflict mass destruction on the U.S. economy. Forbes, whose district is anchored in South Hampton Roads where military installations dominate the economy, unveiled a web ad saying the zeal to cut the nation’s debt has left U.S. defense vulnerable. The commercial says Congress must turn to other programs for savings, or face "catastrophe. " "1.53 million jobs are at risk," the ad’s narrator says. "Pink slips are waiting to be handed out." We wondered if 1.53 million defense jobs really are at risk in the latest round of federal budget negotiations. So we decided to take a look. First, a little background. After much debate in August, Congress agreed to raise the nation’s debt ceiling in return for long-range budget cuts. The first part of the deal called for reducing overall spending by $900 billion over the next 10 years, including about $400 billion in defense cuts. The defense budget is now about $700 billion a year. The legislation set up a 12-member, bipartisan super committee of senators and representatives to cut an additional $1.5 trillion in overall spending. If the group fails to reach consensus by Nov. 23, then $1.2 trillion in reductions will automatically occur -- half from defense and half from domestic programs. That cut to defense, combined with the $400 billion in reductions already agreed on, would mean a total loss of $1 trillion in defense money over the next 10 years. How does Forbes take that figure and compute job losses? Joe Hack, Forbes’ spokesman, pointed us to a comment by Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta in September that a $1 trillion defense cut could add 1 percent to the country’s unemployment rate. Hack then referred us to Bureau of Labor Statistics data showing the size of the U.S. labor force at about 154 million in September. Cutting 1 percent of that would lead to the loss of 1.53 million jobs, he said. We ran the numbers ourselves and found Forbes to be accurate. We came across other estimates that conclude $1 trillion in defense cuts would lead to significant layoffs, although not quite as high as Forbes states. The Department of Defenses says about 6 million jobs are supported by military spending, including 3.8 million private sector jobs, 700,000 Department of Defense jobs and 1.5 million active-duty service members outside of reserve units. "Sequestration ($1 trillion in cuts) assumes across the board spending cuts with losses peaking in the 2013-2014 time period, with 1 million to 1.5 million jobs lost and that could increase the U.S. unemployment rate by nearly 1 percentage point in the near term," said Lt. Col. Elizabeth Robbins, a spokeswoman of the Department of Defense. So Forbes’ number is at the top end of what the Department of Defense estimates as far as job losses. It could be as high as 1.5 million but as low as 1 million, according to the Pentagon. We asked the Defense Department to direct us to any underlying reports showing how they arrived at their numbers for job losses and lower unemployment rate, but they didn’t provide any. The Aerospace Industries Association, which represents aerospace and defense companies, estimates $1 trillion in defense cuts would cause a loss of slightly more than 1 million jobs. Some layoffs would occur among defense industry contractors and suppliers, but the bulk -- some 653,570 jobs -- would be lost in communities due to the to the loss of payroll spending associated with those jobs, the report states. The report was authored by Stephen Fuller, director of the Center of Regional Analysis at George Mason University. In a response to questions from Forbes at a October 26 hearing before the House Armed Services Committee, Fuller said his job loss projections don’t include tallies of lost active duty members or civilians employed by the Department of Defense. In an October 14, 2011 op-ed in the Wall Street Journal, the House Armed Services Committee Chairman, Buck McKeon, R-Calif., said automatic cuts from sequestration "would kill upwards of 800,000 of our active-duty, civilian and industrial American jobs." Claude Schafin, a House Armed Services Committee spokesman, said McKeon’s analysis doesn’t take into account any indirect layoffs in communities that would happen as a result of losses at the Department of Defense and their contractors. Projections of a 1 percent unemployment spike losses have drawn skepticism from some advocacy groups who charge they’re overblown. A study by Heidi Garrett-Peltier, a research professor at the University of Massachusetts, concludes the job losses from defense spending would be less than the Department of Defense estimates. Her work was funded by The Institute for Policy Studies, which says it advocates for a U.S. foreign policy based in part on demilitarization. In an interview Garrett-Peltier said a $1 trillion military cut over 10 years would cost about 860,000 jobs funded either directly or indirectly by the Department of Defense. If you include additional jobs losses in communities from a loss in spending from laid-off employees, the jobs loss would be 1.1 million, she said. Garrett-Peltier said government spending on defense does not generate as many jobs as investments in health care, education and other areas. "Are we better off cutting $100 billion in the defense budget or from education, health care, clean energy?" Garrett-Peltier said. "We would lose more jobs (from domestic cuts) than cutting $100 billion a year in defense." Our ruling: Forbes, in a web ad, says 1.53 million jobs would be lost if defense cuts hit $1 trillion. The congressman is clearly presenting a worst-case scenario, basing his figures on a statement by Defense Secretary Leon Panetta. The actual estimate by the Department of Defense -- which Forbes does not note -- is job loss between 1 million and 1.5 million. Other experts come up with smaller estimates, although their math does not always include all potential layoffs from reduced military -- such as local businesses, active duty members and the like. We don’t want to minimize the economic impact of $1 trillion in defense cuts. Forbes’ statement on the resulting job loss is credible, but very much on the high side estimates out there. We rate his claim Mostly True.	None	Randy Forbes	None	None	None	2011-10-29T07:00:00	2011-10-12	['None']

pomt-14784	The "federal government is going after school districts, trying to force them to let boys shower with little girls."	false	/texas/statements/2015/dec/04/ted-cruz/ted-cruz-incorrectly-says-obama-forcing-boys-and-g/	Sen. Ted Cruz recently veered from discussing Syria to suggesting our government wants schoolboys to shower with girls. The Republican presidential candidate commented after interviewer Steven Crowder mentioned "genetically proper pronouns." "Look," Cruz said, "these guys are so nutty that the federal government is going after school districts, trying to force them to let boys shower with little girls." The Texan went on: "Now listen: I’m the father of two daughters, and the idea that the federal government is coming in saying that boys, with all the god-given equipment of boys, can be in the shower room with junior high girls – this is lunacy. And I bet you there are a whole lot of parents – particularly parents of daughters – that are not eager to have the federal government saying, ‘Guess what? Your daughter has to shower with a boy, if he wants to be in there,’ " Cruz said. A video of the conversation was posted online Nov. 19, 2015. We hadn’t heard about a push for coed showers by the government under President Barack Obama and also didn’t hear back from Cruz’s campaign about how he concluded the government is trying to let boys shower with girls. But a Nov. 22, 2015, news story in The Advocate said Cruz "appeared to be alluding to the administration’s recent support of two separate transgender students who have sued their school districts after administrators refused to let the students use the restrooms and locker rooms that correspond with their gender identity." Our read: Just one of the mentioned situations involves a student seeking access to locker rooms, though news stories indicate there have been other recent instances of transgender individuals seeking unfettered access to high school locker rooms. What’s a transgender person? For starters, it’s not factually accurate to say that letting transgender students into locker rooms amounts to boys being permitted to shower with girls. A transgender individual is a person whose gender identity, expression or behavior is different from those typically associated with their assigned sex at birth, according to the National Center for Transgender Equality. Broadly, this can mean a person born a boy identifies as a girl or vice versa. A transgender also may receive hormone treatments and undertake sex reassignment surgery. Pat Griffin, a professor emeritus at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst, advocates for including lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender students in college and interscholastic athletics. Griffin wrote in September 2015: "It is important for policy-makers to understand that transgender girls (who were assigned a male gender at birth) are not boys. Their consistent and affirmed gender identity as girls is as deep-seated as the gender identity of non-transgender girls." After we posted this fact check, readers suggested we'd failed to capture the ongoing debate over transgender rights; we followed up by writing this story. "Student A" in Illinois The Advocate story led us to check into the case of an Illinois transgender girl barred by her school district from changing clothes for gym class and other activities with girls. The girl, represented by the ACLU of Illinois, filed a complaint in 2013 charging sex discrimination in violation of federal law. On Nov. 2, 2015, the Office of Civil Rights in the U.S. Department of Education wrote the superintendent of the school district in Palatine, Ill., northwest of Chicago, saying the district’s restriction violates Title IX, the federal bar on sex discrimination in any education program or activity. The ACLU of Illinois declared the federal holding had national significance. "The decision places school districts all across the nation on notice that Title IX requires making such facilities available for students who are transgender," the group said. "It is the first such decision issued by the department, building on legal briefs and policy statements of the federal government interpreting federal laws prohibiting discrimination." The office’s letter, signed by regional director Adele Rapport of Chicago, says "Student A" was born male and from a young age identified as female, transitioning in middle school "to living full-time as a young woman" and, among steps evidently not including sex reassignment surgery, taking "an ongoing course of hormone therapy." Also, the letter says, the district has given the student "unlimited access to all girls’ restrooms in the school" and "allows her to participate in girls’ athletics." According to the letter, the student, required to take a daily gym class, sought "an opportunity to change clothes privately within the girls’ locker rooms, in an area such as a restroom stall." The district answered that it would not be "practicable" to do so in the school’s six girls locker rooms "because there were too few stalls and too many students," the office wrote. The letter further says the student told the office in October 2015 she’d use privacy curtains in the locker rooms if the school made them available. Talks involving the district and office did not lead to a resolution, the letter says. School district stresses private changing rooms The Palatine-based Township High School District 211 said in a Nov. 2, 2015, press release it disagreed with the department’s ruling and beyond continuing settlement negotiations, it was prepared to "engage in all avenues of due process to determine whether our position of honoring the rights of all the students is within the law." The district’s release also said: "The students in our schools are teenagers, not adults, and one's gender is not the same as one's anatomy. Boys and girls are in separate locker rooms – where there are open changing areas and open shower facilities – for a reason." A Nov. 3, 2015, Chicago Tribune news story said the district had 30 days to reach an agreement with authorities or risk having its federal educational funding suspended or terminated and the matter also could be referred to the Department of Justice. And on Dec. 3, 2015, after Cruz made his claim, the government announced a settlement with the district agreeing to give the student access to school locker rooms "based on the student's request to change in private changing stations" in the rooms. Other conflicts A Nov. 2, 2015, New York Times news story on the Illinois dispute said: "The rights of transgender students have become the focus of disputes in school districts in many states, leading to divergent approaches regarding which sports teams they can play on, bathrooms they can use and pronouns they are addressed by. In separate cases, two California school districts agreed to lift restrictions on transgender locker room and restroom access after federal officials intervened. Students at one Missouri high school protested a decision by the district to let a transgender girl use female locker rooms and restrooms." In the Missouri instance, the Times reported Sept. 2, 2015, transgender Lila Perry, 17, used girls’ restrooms and locker rooms until a local protest led her to drop her physical education class. Professor’s take We called Griffin, the professor emeritus, who told us it’s her view that boys showering with girls is an inaccurate characterization of the government saying transgender students should, by law, have full access to school facilities including locker rooms. Griffin also called the education department’s ruling in Illinois "the developing precedent" nationally. Cruz’s statement, Griffin said, amounts to "fearmongering" and "reflects a complete ignorance" of transgender students, especially overlooking the fact that a transgender girl is not a boy so "it’s not a boy in the girls’ locker room." In contrast, Griffin said, the focus of most U.S. school officials has been on ensuring every student has a right to privacy in a locker room or restroom. Griffin, asked about state policies on transgender student-athletes, pointed us to a breakdown on Transathlete.com, which compiles policies and research regarding transgender inclusion in sports. According to the website, Texas ranks among about a dozen states with no policy ensuring transgender participation. The site touts Massachusetts’ policy, which says, in part: "Where there are sex-segregated classes or athletic activities, including intramural and interscholastic athletics, all students must be allowed to participate in a manner consistent with their gender identity." We also reached out to the federal education department, which did not comment on Cruz’s claim but pointed us to a Nov. 2, 2015, statement by Catherine Lhamon, an assistant secretary in the agency’s Office for Civil Rights, saying: "All students deserve the opportunity to participate equally in school programs and activities – this is a basic civil right. Unfortunately, Township High School District 211 is not following the law because the district continues to deny a female student the right to use the girls’ locker room. The district can provide access to this student while also respecting all students’ privacy." Our ruling Cruz said the "federal government is going after school districts, trying to force them to let boys shower with little girls." Cruz’s vision of schoolboys everywhere showering with girls grossly distorts the issue. The fact is the Obama administration has sided with transgender students seeking access to school facilities including locker rooms, holding that anything less would violate federal anti-discrimination requirements. Such conflicts — few and far between — haven’t had to do with the government wanting boys to shower with girls. We rate the claim False. FALSE – The statement is not accurate.

pomt-07520	"We’re paying out-of-state residential facilities hundreds of thousands of dollars, if not more," to house children in state custody	mostly true	/rhode-island/statements/2011/apr/08/roberto-dasilva/rep-dasilva-says-ri-pays-hundreds-thousands-dollar/	State Rep. Roberto DaSilva recently introduced legislation intended to make it much more difficult for the state Department of Children, Youth and Families to send children in its care to out-of-state residential treatment facilities. He said he was moved by the story of Nicholas Alahverdian, who was the subject of a column by The Providence Journal’s Bob Kerr. Alahverdian says he endured years of abuse and neglect in two out-of-state residential facilities where he was sent by DCYF. He has formed his own nonprofit organization to advocate for children in DCYF care. He has also filed state and federal lawsuits stemming from his alleged mistreatment. DaSilva said in a General Assembly news release that Rhode Island has the resources to provide children with the treatment they need within the state. DaSilva said he is concerned about the well-being of children in state care and also about keeping taxpayer dollars in the state. "We’re paying out-of-state residential facilities hundreds of thousands of dollars, if not more, to house our own state residents," DaSilva said. "It just doesn’t make sense, especially in these dire economic times." Among the children the DCYF takes into its custody are those who are victims of abuse or neglect caused by their primary caretakers, those who are in the juvenile justice system and ordered by courts to have access to rehabilitative care, and those with emotional, behavioral or developmental challenges who need out-of-home care and treatment and whose parents give DCYF temporary custody, according to DCYF interim Director Kevin J. Aucoin. The DCYF has said it is working to reduce its dependence on residential treatment programs, both in Rhode Island and in other states. So we wondered whether the agency is still spending as much as DaSilva says on such placements. We asked DaSilva where he got his information and he referred us to a website called the Rhode Island DCYF Transparency Portal. It shows the agency’s expenditures in various categories such as personnel and foster care. The top expenditure is residential services. For fiscal year 2010, for instance, the portal shows the state spent $117 million for residential care for youth in DCYF custody, which also includes costs for foster home placements and varous community services Much of that money was spent on local services such as Child and Family Services of Newport County or Ocean Tides, a residential treatment program in Narragansett for male juvenile offenders. The DCYF also budgets an additional $22.4 million this year for youths sent to the Rhode Island Training School. But the website shows that millions of dollars go to out-of-state programs. For example, Mass Mentor Inc., which provides services at several Massachusetts locations to children with developmental disabilities was paid $376,829 in the first quarter. During the same quarter, the Bennington School in Vermont was paid $77,769 and the Glen Mills School in Pennsylvania got $59,246. We asked Kevin J. Aucoin, interim director of DCYF, for more data. He said that this fiscal year, the DCYF expects to spend $65.5 million on residential services for 718 children, with $9.5 million going to out-of-state facilities, most of them in nearby states. Aucoin says the spending on residential programs has been declining. In fiscal year 2007, for example, the state spent $85.4 million for 1,102 children. In that year, it spent $18.4 million to send 154 children out of state. All residential placements are expected to be reduced as the agency adopts a new model of care that focuses on keeping families together. Aucoin said the DCYF sends children out of state for specialized treatments not offered by in-state providers. Those include multiple psychiatric diagnoses and severe and profound developmental disabilities. The majority, he said, have severe aggressive behaviors. Some may be youth with significant "sexual offending behaviors." Aucoin said children are placed out of state only with approval of the Family Court and only after the agency demonstrates there is no adequate program in-state. So it appears the only fault with DaSilva’s claim is it is too conservative. Instead of spending the "hundreds of thousands," DaSilva claims, the state actually expects to spend nearly $10 million on out-of-state programs. We find his claim to be Mostly True.

pomt-09612	Says Land Commissioner Jerry Patterson threatened to shoot him.	pants on fire!	/texas/statements/2010/jan/15/hector-uribe/hector-uribe-says-jerry-patterson-threatened-shoot/	Two former state senators are warming up Texas-style in anticipation of a fall showdown over who should be Texas land commissioner through 2014. Lately, they've kidded each other about gunplay. Democrat Hector Uribe's campaign went so far as to issue a press release suggesting the Republican he hopes to defeat, incumbent Commissioner Jerry Patterson, recently threatened to shoot him. Uribe's Jan. 11 release states: "Meanwhile, Uribe’s Republican opponent threatened to shoot him last week." Keeping our own tongues firmly in cheek, we checked into the claim. Uribe's spokesman, Harold Cook, traced Patterson's threat to an item in the online Quorum Report. In the Jan. 4 item, Patterson notes that he and Uribe both appeared in "The Alamo," a movie. Patterson wrote, according to the report: "Hector's a friend and fellow actor. We were both in the recent movie ‘The Alamo’, filmed near Austin, albeit on different sides in the conflict (actually Hector had a real part, I was just an extra). When Hector surrendered at San Jacinto, I should have shot him when I had the chance... " "I hope folks understand then we were just acting, now it's a real war," the item quotes Patterson saying. Contacted later, Patterson — who once helped pass Texas' concealed-weapon law — said he was joking about any shooting. "If it's not tongue-in-cheek stuff, that's a criminal offense," Patterson said. "You're not supposed to threaten people. Does this put me on the (federal) no-fly list?" Probably not. Especially when it's all just in good fun — and he didn't really make a threat. He just expressed ex post facto regret. This is why we love Texas politics. Where else would a (pretend) gunfight spill into a (real) race for land commissioner? And where else would we get to fact check a claim like this one? For making us laugh and for reminding us not to take this stuff too seriously, we give Uribe's claim that he was threatened a rating of Pants on Fire. And we suggest that all guns remain holstered for the rest of the campaign.	None	Hector Uribe	None	None	None	2010-01-15T11:58:00	2010-01-11	['None']

pomt-03983	Says abortions are decreasing.	true	/texas/statements/2013/feb/12/donna-howard/donna-howard-says-abortions-are-decreasing/	Responding to a question about lawmakers barring state aid to Planned Parenthood clinics, state Rep. Donna Howard said she hopes colleagues reverse course after they see the impact of clinic closings on constituents. The Austin Democrat, speaking at a Jan. 22, 2013, Texas Tribune public interview, also said such closings could drive up abortions. "Those who are claiming that they want to reduce abortion, which I think is just about everybody, I don’t think anybody wants to see that increase -- and in fact, it has be.en decreasing," Howard said. A reader asked us to check whether abortions are decreasing. We quickly found state and federal figures indicating a decrease. Howard’s chief of staff, Scott Daigle, guided us to information kept by the Texas Department of State Health Services, which says that "induced terminations of pregnancy" in the state totaled 77,592 in 2010, down from 77,850 the year before and 81,591 in 2008. Agency spokeswoman Carrie Williams provided a chart confirming those figures and covering additional years. She added, by email, that preliminary data indicate 72,470 abortions occurred in 2011 -- some 5,100 fewer than the year before. The chart shows that while the number of abortions decreased every year from 2009 through 2011, it went up in five of the eight previous years, topping out at 82,056 in 2006. Daigle also said that a November 2012 report by the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention states that abortions nationally decreased from 857,475 in 2000 to 784,507 in 2009. According to information posted online by the centers, those tallies drew from data submitted voluntarily by states and other "reporting areas," which it had been collecting since 1969. The 2009 abortion rate for 45 "reporting areas," ranging from states to New York City that had continuously provided data since 2000, the centers say, was 15.1 abortions per 1,000 women aged 15-44 years and the abortion ratio was 227 abortions per 1,000 live births. It said the figures were based on data evaluated from the areas that reported data every year during 2000-2009. Compared with 2008, the total number and rate of reported abortions for 2009 decreased 5 percent and the abortion ratio decreased 2 percent, CDC said. "The change from 2008 to 2009 represented the largest single-year decrease in the total number and rate of reported abortions for the entire period from 2000 to 2009," the center says. From 2000 to 2009 the number, rate, and ratio of reported abortions decreased 6 percent, 7 percent and 8 percent, respectively, to the lowest levels for the period, the center says. Historically, abortions surged after a key court ruling, then started decreasing. According to the centers’ Nov. 23, 2012, "Abortion Surveillance" report for 2009, abortions ramped up after the 1973 U.S. Supreme Court decision legalizing the procedure in all states.: After the decision, "the total number, rate (number of abortions per 1,000 women aged 15-44 years), and ratio (number of abortions per 1,000 live births) of reported abortions increased rapidly, reaching the highest levels in the 1980s before decreasing at a slow yet steady pace," the report says. "However, the incidence of abortion has varied considerably across demographic subpopulations, and recent reports through 2008 have suggested that the sustained pattern of decrease has leveled off. Continued surveillance is needed to monitor long-term changes in the incidence of abortion in the United States." Separately, we asked the Guttmacher Institute, which studies and advocates on issues related to reproductive health, for its analysis. Broadly, spokeswoman Rebecca Wind said by email, the "national numbers and rates of abortion were declining from the early 1990s to about 2005, but appear to have leveled off in the most recent period studied." She pointed us to a January 2011 Guttmacher paper on the incidence of abortion in 2007 and 2008, based on interviews of abortion providers, saying by phone that the next update, drawing on interviews being conducted this year, is to be published in early 2014. The 2011 paper includes a chart indicating that the number of U.S. abortions peaked at 1.6 million and hovered above 1.2 million from 2004 through 2008, the last year shown. The incidence of abortion changed little between 2005 and 2008, the paper says. The number of abortions increased by 0.5 percent, from 1,206,200 to 1,212,350, the paper says, while the abortion rate increased 1 percent, from 19.4 to 19.6 per 1,000 women aged 15-44. Also, the abortion ratio did not change over this period, remaining at 22 abortions per 100 pregnancies. Wind told us that while the decline in abortion had leveled off from 2005 through 2008, this followed a long-term decline in abortion rates. Our ruling Howard said abortions are decreasing. The Texas tally has dropped for several consecutive years, while nationally the total hovered around 1.2 million from 2005 through 2008, by one analysis, and the number and rate decreased in 2009, according to information analyzed by the Centers for Disease Control.

pomt-13607	"Toomey crossed party lines… to stop gun sales to suspects on the terror watch list."	mostly false	/pennsylvania/statements/2016/aug/15/independence-usa-pac/did-pat-toomey-cross-party-lines-tighten-gun-laws-/	As Pennsylvania Republican Sen. Pat Toomey battles for re-election in one of the most important senate races in the nation, it’s been his record on guns that’s drawn some of the most attention. It’s apparently part of why former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg endorsed Toomey, and Bloomberg’s political action committee is now running ads in support of Toomey that tout his efforts to "put our safety ahead of partisan politics." The Independence USA PAC bankrolled an ad running in Pennsylvania that claims "Toomey crossed party lines twice: first to support background checks, and now to stop gun sales to suspects on the terror watch list." We’ve written before about Toomey signing on in 2013 and putting his name on a bill that would have expanded background checks. But what about his efforts to stop gun sales to suspects on the terror watch list? Toomey’s record there is a bit murkier. To be clear: A bill that would stop gun sales to suspects on any sort of terror watch list has not passed. Efforts were made after the June shooting in Orlando at Pulse Nightclub, the deadliest mass shooting in American history, which left 49 people and the shooter dead. But those efforts were fruitless. There were several major bills drafted in the wake of Orlando that would have closed what’s been called "the terror loophole," or would make it harder for suspected terrorists on the federal government’s radar to buy guns. Two such bills -- both with largely partisan backing -- were brought up for a vote on June 20 and both were defeated. Proponents of a ban on gun sales to those on a terror watch list say individuals who are suspected terrorists appear on a no-fly list, but are still allowed to purchase guns. Opponents worry individuals who accidentally end up on the no-fly list would be stripped of their second amendment rights. The Democrats’ bill was a plan by Sen. Dianne Feinstein of California, and her bill would have placed a blanket ban on the purchase of guns by those on the no-fly list, as it was dubbed "no-fly, no buy." Some Republicans argued her bill didn’t give an out to people who may have ended up on the watch list mistakenly. Two Republicans voted in favor of Feinstein’s bill. Toomey wasn’t one of them, saying the bill didn’t include enough due process for potential gun owners. The majority of Republicans supported a bill from Sen. John Cornyn, of Texas. His measure, which was backed by the National Rifle Association, would have placed a three-day hold when anyone on the terror watch list attempted to purchase a gun. Within those three days, the government would have to present a case before a court in order to stop the person from buying the firearm. Though Toomey said in June that it would be hard for law enforcement to make Cornyn’s measure "workable," he voted in favor of it in the end. Toomey also drafted his own bill to close the terror loophole, which he touted as a measure that would bridge the gap between the Feinstein and the Cornyn amendments. Under Toomey’s plan, the U.S. attorney general would generate a list of "likely terrorists" separate from the existing no-fly list. The Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court would review the list, and the attorney general would have the power to block the purchase of a gun by an individual on that list. But Toomey’s bill largely flopped. Though he was reportedly in talks with gun control group Everytown for Gun Safety, the group ultimately didn’t endorse his proposal. Republican leaders didn’t put it up for a vote, and Democrats largely opposed it. When PolitiFact reached out to Toomey’s campaign to inquire about his record when it comes to closing the terror loophole, his campaign pointed out that Toomey was one of eight Republicans to support an amendment from Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, that would have given the Justice Department the ability to deny gun sales to individuals on two terror-related lists -- and it had an appeal process. That bill, which Toomey spoke on the Senate floor in favor of, had bipartisan support and survived a "test vote" several days after the Feinstein and Cornyn amendments failed. That showed that the bill had significant support, but not the 60 votes it would need to advance -- meaning GOP leaders probably won’t bring it up for a full vote any time soon. Independence USA, which is running the ads in Pennsylvania, didn’t respond to a request for comment. Our Ruling In an ad running in Pennsylvania, the Independence USA PAC backed by Mayor Michael Bloomberg claimed "Toomey crossed party lines… to stop gun sales to suspects on the terror watch list." This ad is misleading at its core, largely because a measure to stop gun sales to suspects on the terror watch list never passed. Toomey’s own bill failed to garner significant support from either side of the aisle. Though he voted for the Collins amendment which had bipartisan support, that amendment was drafted by a Republican. In the end, Toomey voted with his party when he voted against Feinstein’s bill and in favor of Cornyn’s. We rate the claim Mostly False.

pomt-01882	"We in this state saw more job creation in the last three years since I've been governor than you saw in the whole eight years of Doyle’s time as governor."	mostly true	/wisconsin/statements/2014/jul/09/scott-walker/scott-walker-says-job-growth-better-under-jim-doyl/	Gov. Scott Walker is unintimidated when it comes to sizing up his job growth numbers next to his predecessor’s. But did he create more jobs in his first three years than former Gov. Jim Doyle did over two full terms? Walker made that claim during a June 19, 2014 news conference at Milwaukee’s annual Water Summit. "We, in this state, saw more job creation in the last three years since I’ve been governor than you saw in the whole eight years of Doyle’s time as governor," Walker said. "So I think if people look, are we at where we want to be in terms of our goals? Going forward, voters will see the difference. The last thing we want to go back to is a much lower job creation number, even before the recession." Walker has focused a lot on Doyle’s record as he’s come under criticism from Mary Burke, the leading Democrat in the 2014 governor’s race, for lagging on his promise to help create 250,000 new private-sector jobs in his first four-year term. (We have rated that promise Stalled). Let’s see if Walker’s latest comparison holds up. Wisconsin private sector job growth When we asked Walker’s press secretary, Laurel Patrick, for data to back up this comparison, she cited the Quarterly Census of Employment and Wages, a set of data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. This is considered the gold standard when it comes to jobs data, as it is based on a survey of nearly all state businesses. It is released about seven months after every quarter ends. The scorecard as of June 19, 2014 shows the state lost 47,413 private-sector jobs by the end of Doyle’s eight-year tenure. Under Walker, the state gained 91,813 private sector jobs from 2011 through 2013. In Doyle’s first full term from 2003 through 2006, the state gained 86,530 jobs, which was still slower than the national average. It was 5,283 fewer jobs than were added during Walker’s first three years. Wisconsin has experienced slow-moving growth for the past decade, said Dale Knapp, research director at the Wisconsin Taxpayers Alliance, a private fiscal research group. "That’s simply the nature of our economy," Knapp said. "(Wisconsin) tends to go with the (national) economy but at a slower pace." State job creation has grown at this slow pace since at least 2000, a September 2013 Wisconsin Taxpayers Alliance study showed.The study tracked the state economy from 2000 to 2012 and found that job creation has declined as has population growth. It’s hard to create jobs if there aren’t workers to fill them. Digging deeper A more nuanced picture emerges when you look more closely at Doyle’s full time in office. In Doyle’s first term, from 2003 through 2006, the state gained 86,530 jobs, which was still slower than the national average. It was 5,283 fewer jobs than were added during Walker’s first three years. In December 2007, the Great Recession began -- about one year into Doyle’s second term. When the recession took its toll, the unemployment rate rose to 10 percent in Wisconsin and the state lost 133,943 jobs during Doyle’s second term. That created the net loss of 47,413 jobs by the end of 2010. By official measures, the recovery from the recession started in June 2009. Wisconsin saw a jobs turnaround in 2010, the last year Doyle was in office, when 33,658 jobs were added. That’s significant because it was the last time Wisconsin outpaced the national average in job growth. In 2011, when Walker took office, job growth did not keep up with the national or regional pace, according to a September 2012 study from the Center on Wisconsin Strategy, a non-profit think tank. The study shows Wisconsin lost 21,900 jobs between January 2011 and May 2012. That put its rate of job growth at 0.73 percent, slowest in the midwest and 42nd in the nation. Job growth has been slow yet steadily positive since 2011 but no evidence shows the pace is changing, according to Laura Dresser, Associate Director at the Center on Wisconsin Strategy. "Wisconsin is on the weak side of an already weak recovery," Dresser said. In the middle of a gubernatorial race, Walker has worked to frame the jobs issue to his advantage. So has Burke, who was secretary of commerce under Doyle from 2005 to 2007. Here are the year-by-year private sector figures going back to Doyle’s first year: Year Job growth percent Number of jobs gained or lost Doyle: 2003 +0.236% 5,479 Doyle: 2004 +1.69% 39,374 Doyle: 2005 +0.835% 19,741 Doyle: 2006 +0.928% 21,936 Doyle: 2007 +0.33% 7,970 Doyle: 2008 -2.34% -56,463 Doyle: 2009 -5.05% -119,108 Doyle: 2010 +1.5% 33,658 Walker: 2011 +1.322% 29,800 Walker: 2012 +1.47% 33,872 Walker: 2013 +1.21% 28,141 Said Knapp: "Governors like to take credit for growing jobs, but in the bigger picture, there’s not a whole lot they do that affects job creation. We’re more affected by what happens nationally than state policy." Last year, Wisconsin added 28,141 jobs at a rate of 1.2 percent that ranks 37th in the nation based on figures released June 19, 2014 by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. Our rating Walker said, "We in this state, saw more job creation in the last three years since I've been governor than you saw in the whole eight years of Doyle’s time as governor." Walker is right on the numbers that show Wisconsin did gain more jobs in his first three years as governor than Doyle did in his eight years. But there’s an indirect element of blame in his claim. On that score, it’s worth noting Wisconsin consistently trailed the nation in job growth before the Great Recession triggered the second-term losses that dragged down Doyle’s tally. Walker skates past that fact as he chooses a comparison most favorable to himself. We rate Walker’s claim Mostly True.	None	Scott Walker	None	None	None	2014-07-09T05:00:00	2014-06-19	['None']
pomt-14843	"71% of WI’s roads are in poor or mediocre condition and 14% of WI’s bridges are structurally deficient or functionally obsolete."	mostly true	/wisconsin/statements/2015/nov/18/jennifer-shilling/jennifer-shilling-71-state-roads-rated-poor-or-med/	In early November 2015, potholes prompted some crossing of party lines when the Legislature’s Joint Finance Committee approved Republican Gov. Scott Walker’s plan to borrow $350 million over the next two years for road projects. Democrats offered key support. Even before that, Senate Minority Leader Jennifer Shilling (D-La Crosse) was arguing more spending was needed. On Oct. 1, 2015 she tweeted this: "71% of WI’s roads are in poor or mediocre condition and 14% of WI’s bridges are structurally deficient or functionally obsolete. #JustFixIt" In Wisconsin’s budget battles over infrastructure, few deny the need for road maintenance. But is Shilling right about how bad the situation is? Digging into the numbers Shilling’s team directed us to a report from the U.S. Department of Transportation that cited the same statistics as the tweet -- that 71 percent of roads in Wisconsin are in poor or mediocre condition and 14 percent of bridges are classified as structurally deficient or functionally obsolete. So, the report is quoted accurately. But what about the numbers themselves? The two statistics were drawn from different sources of data. The data on road conditions came from the 2013 Report Card for America’s Infrastructure. The report, the most recent available, is put out by the American Society of Civil Engineers, a trade and advocacy organization. By the group’s tally, Wisconsin is one of just six states with at least 70 percent of roads rated in poor or mediocre condition, meaning our roads are in worse shape than the national average. But experts caution that the report card can overstate the amount of need for road repairs. First, the report uses a small source of data for each state and then extrapolates that data to the entire state roadway system. Ashwat Anandanarayanan, director of transportation policy for the environmental group 1000 Friends of Wisconsin, said the civil engineers’ reports also conflate new roadway construction and maintenance, resulting in what appears to be greater need. "Lots of roads need to be fixed," he said. "Not a lot need to be expanded." So then, what is a better measuring stick? The Wisconsin Department of Transportation collects its own data on road conditions that is used in the Highway Performance Monitoring System by the Federal Highway Administration, which is considered the gold standard of transportation information. According to these figures, the percentage of Wisconsin roads in poor or mediocre condition is much lower -- 38 percent of the state highway system falls into those categories. That doesn’t mean the state will fare better in a national comparison by that measure. In fact, the state lags behind the U.S. average in most indicators of roadway quality. As for bridges, Shilling said 14 percent of Wisconsin’s bridges were in disrepair or functionally obsolete. This statistic, which is accurate, came from WisDOT data submitted to the Federal Highway Administration. But while Shilling cites the number as evidence of the state being behind, Wisconsin does pretty well here in a national comparison. Only three states — Arizona, Minnesota and Nevada — reported a smaller percentage of bridges in disrepair. Our rating Shilling said "71 % of WI’s roads are in poor or mediocre condition and 14% of WI’s bridges are structurally deficient or functionally obsolete." The report she cited from the federal Department of Transportation backed up her figures, but the numbers used for her road statistic aren’t the most accurate available. By another measure, the percentage of roads in poor or mediocre condition is far smaller. There was no dispute on the bridge number, though on that front the state actually fares better than most others. We rate the claim Mostly True.

pomt-05465	Says the Congressional Budget Office has estimated "every penny of the federal budget will go to interest on the debt and entitlement spending by 2025."	true	/virginia/statements/2012/apr/23/frank-wolf/will-entitlement-programs-and-debt-consume-us-budg/	U.S. Rep. Frank Wolf says the nation’s fiscal future is dark. "According to the Congressional Budget Office’s long-term estimate, every penny of the federal budget will go to interest on the debt and entitlement spending by 2025," Wolf, R-10th, said in a March 28 speech on the House floor. "That means no money for national defense. No money for homeland security. No money to fix the nation’s crumbling bridges and roads. No money for medical research to find a cure for cancer or Alzheimer’s or Parkinson’s diseases," Wolf added. Is that really what the nonpartisan CBO said? Dan Scandling, Wolf’s spokesman, said his boss was referring to a June 2011 report from the CBO detailing the agency’s latest long-term outlook on the nation’s fiscal fitness. Tables in the report contain projections showing that by 2025, payments for Social Security, Medicaid, Medicare and debt interest will exceed all federal revenues going into the budget. That’s a shade different from Wolf’s statement that there won’t be any money at all to pay for additional programs since, beyond using tax revenues, the U.S. also has been known to borrow money to finance its budget. That technical distinction caught the eye of budget analysts we spoke to. But it doesn’t detract from Wolf’s gist that the CBO report shows the growing costs of entitlement programs and debt payments are eating up the government’s resources. The CBO’s scenario of exhausted revenues was based on the assumption that major U.S. policies in effect in June 2011 will continue indefinitely, such as extending the Bush tax cuts and preserving Medicare reimbursement levels to physicians. The CBO also laid out a second, more optimistic outlook that assumed laws on the books in June 2011 will take effect. That means that the Bush tax cuts would actually expire at the end of this year and Medicare payments to physicians would fall sharply in 2013. Under that scenario, revenues through 2085 would always stay above the costs of entitlement programs and interest payments on the national debt. So Wolf is focusing on the bleakest CBO outlook. Is that fair? Jim Horney, a vice-president at the liberal Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, said Wolf is not alone in citing the dark scenario. Although current laws call for ending all the Bush tax cuts and lowering Medicare reimbursements, Horney said it will be politically difficult for Congress to carry out these actions. Wolf’s statement is similar to the conclusion reached in 2010 by a bipartisan commission appointed by President Barack Obama to recommend ways reduce the national debt. "By 2025 (federal) revenue will be able to finance only interest payments, Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security," the National Commission on Fiscal Responsibility and Reform stated in its final report. "Every other federal government activity -- from national defense and homeland security to transportation and energy -- will have to be paid for with borrowed money." Two analysts told us the gloomy forecast offers the most realistic map of the financial road ahead. Jason Peuquet, research director at the centrist Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, said his organization has run its own numbers and concluded that entitlement and debt interest will outpace revenues in 2026. Josh Gordon, policy director at the centrist Concord Coalition,a group that urges deficit reduction, pointed to a March 2012 report from the General Accounting Office that shows at some point between 2020 and 2030, the amount of spending on entitlements and interest will outpace all federal revenues going into the budget under the more pessimistic scenario. "The real key is the revenues are still pretty low," Gordon said. "The lower the revenue, the easier it is for spending programs to be larger than it." Our ruling Wolf said the CBO projects that by 2025, every penny of the federal budget will go to interest on the debt as well as spending on Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security. The CBO report he cites says entitlements programs and debt interest will consume all the revenues going into the budget that year. Wolf’s language is a bit inexact, but we don’t think it detracts from his clear point: the U.S. is on a dangerous fiscal path. We rate his statement True.

pomt-11030	"The deficit ... is coming down, and it’s coming down rapidly."	pants on fire!	/truth-o-meter/statements/2018/jul/02/larry-kudlow/larry-kudlow-wrong-about-deficits-falling-rapidly-/	Larry Kudlow, director of the National Economic Council for President Donald Trump, raised eyebrows when he said in a Fox Business Network interview that the nation’s deficit is falling on Trump’s watch. The economy under President Donald Trump, Kudlow said on June 29, "is throwing out enormous amounts of new tax revenues. As the economy gears up, more people working, better jobs and careers -- those revenues come rolling in, and the deficit, which is one of the other criticisms (of Trump’s economic policy), is coming down, and it’s coming down rapidly. Growth solves a lot of problems." See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com As it happens, the deficit hasn’t come down to date -- which sparked a quick backlash on social media and prompted Kudlow to amend his remarks later that day. Kudlow told the Washington Post that "the economy is so strong right now it’s going to produce lower deficits. I probably should have said future deficits." However, that assertion is questionable as well. The most trusted source for future budget projections, the Congressional Budget Office, shows rising deficits for years into the future. The deficit so far under Trump In fiscal year 2015, when Barack Obama was president, the federal deficit was $438 billion. (A refresher: The deficit refers to federal revenues minus federal outlays. Each year’s deficit adds to the overall public debt.) In fiscal year 2016, which was also under Obama, the deficit rose to $585 billion. In fiscal year 2017, which was about two-thirds on Trump’s watch, the deficit rose to $665 billion. The deficit also rose as a percentage of the nation’s gross domestic product -- a way of comparing economic statistics across time. In fiscal year 2015, the deficit was 2.4 percent of GDP, rising to 3.2 percent of GDP in fiscal 2016 and 3.5 percent in fiscal 2017. So on a full-year basis, Kudlow is wrong. He’s also wrong if you look at the first seven months of fiscal year 2018. According to the Treasury Department, the first seven months of the current fiscal year saw a deficit of $385 billion -- which is 12 percent higher than the first seven months of fiscal year 2017, when the deficit totaled $344 billion. The future course of the deficit As for the future, CBO finds no reason to expect the deficit to go down any time soon. For fiscal year 2018, CBO projects a deficit of $804 billion, rising each successive year to $981 billion in 2019, $1 trillion in 2020, $1.1 trillion in 2021, and $1.3 trillion in 2022. The deficit is also poised to increase as a percentage of GDP -- from 3.5 percent in 2017 to 4.0 in 2018 and eventually to 5.4 percent in 2022. Here’s the full chart from CBO’s most recent projections, released in April. Not only that, but CBO specifically cited the tax cut Trump backed and signed into law as a reason for spiraling deficits. "The deficit that CBO now estimates for 2018 is $242 billion larger than the one that it projected for that year in June 2017," CBO wrote in its April report. "Accounting for most of that difference is a $194 billion reduction in projected revenues, mainly because the 2017 tax act is expected to reduce collections of individual and corporate income taxes." And the projections would be even worse if Congress doesn’t allow the recent round of tax cuts to expire. "In that scenario, far larger deficits and much greater debt would result than in CBO’s baseline projections for the 2019–2028 period," CBO wrote. Our ruling Kudlow said, "The deficit ... is coming down, and it’s coming down rapidly." After being criticized, he later clarified that he "probably should have said future deficits." Kudlow’s first formulation is wrong, and his revised version isn’t supported by the most widely trusted barometer -- projections by the CBO. Trump tax bill, which dramatically cut revenues, is a big reason why. The statement is inaccurate and ridiculous. We rate the statement Pants on Fire!

pomt-03987	There are twice as many gun shops as McDonald’s in the United States.	mostly true	/georgia/statements/2013/feb/11/markel-hutchins/are-there-more-places-buy-gun-big-mac/	So what’s easier to find? The golden arches or a gun shop. The Rev. Markel Hutchins, an Atlanta-based civil rights activist, had an answer during a recent discussion about federal gun legislation on "The Ryan Cameron Show," which airs weekday mornings on V-103 FM in Atlanta. "There are twice as many gun shops as McDonald’s," Hutchins said. McDonald’s eateries are just about everywhere in America. PolitiFact Georgia was listening while stuck in traffic and wanted to find out whether Hutchins’ claim is true that there are more places to buy a gun than to grab a Happy Meal. Hutchins wants laws to restrict the availability of handguns across the country, particularly in urban areas such as Atlanta. He led a rally last week outside the headquarters of gun manufacturer Glock, located in Smyrna, a northern suburb of Atlanta. Hutchins says gun rights advocates are distorting the intent of the Second Amendment, saying it was written to allow Americans to arm themselves to protect the nation. There had been a spate of high-profile shootings in Atlanta a week before Hutchins’ interview. A 14-year-old boy was shot, allegedly by a 15-year-old boy, on the campus of an Atlanta middle school. The student who was wounded was not seriously injured. A day after that shooting, a Morehouse College student was shot inside a gym on the campus. The student was reportedly in stable condition and expected to make a full recovery. Hutchins said he was indeed claiming that there are more gun shops nationwide than McDonald’s restaurants. Hutchins sent us an ABC News article published in mid-December to back up his claim and said he did some additional research because he didn’t believe it was true. "My God, it was right there," he said. The McDonald’s website contains a number of facts and figures, including how many restaurants there are in the country. The latest tally, as of 2011, was 14,098 in the United States. There were 33,510 worldwide, the website shows. The number on the restaurant’s website matched what ABC reported. The news outlet reported there are 51,438 retail gun stores in America. Programs, such as American Public Media’s "Marketplace," have reported the total is about 58,000. Some online research we did found others making similar claims that there are twice as many gun stores as McDonald’s in America. Those numbers, however, are more complicated than they first appear. What Hutchins and some news outlets have referred to as "guns stores" are actually federal permits issued to sell guns. Those could represent retail establishments that primarily sell guns, larger retail vendors (such as Wal-Mart) that sell guns as part of a much larger retail venue or pawnshops that carry guns as part of their inventory. The numbers also refer to people who sell guns at gun shows several times a year and have no bricks-and-mortar store. We attempted to make an oranges-to-oranges comparison here -- to compare McDonald’s locations to free-standing stores that primarily sell guns. It’s hard to find detailed data on actual gun stores online. The U.S. Census Bureau does not keep data on gun stores. Neither does the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. The U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms keeps a monthly log on its website of how many people and pawnbrokers are licensed to sell guns in the country and its territories. In January, the total was 58,725. About 51,000 of them were gun dealers. The rest were pawnbrokers. In Georgia, the total in January was 1,746. In 2011, to be consistent with the most recent information we have about the number of McDonald’s restaurants nationwide, there were 56,059 federally licensed firearms dealers and pawnbrokers in the country. That’s quadruple the number of places to buy Chicken McNuggets. The ATF does not track how many licensed dealers own a business that they sell guns from as opposed to those who may sell guns at a show. The ATF database has lists of every person licensed to sell guns. In Georgia, most people on the January list say they own a business. There were about 175 people on the list with a license who did not include the name of a business. About 100 of them are retail stores such as Wal-Mart, Dick’s Sporting Goods and Academy Sports & Outdoors. In some cases, the list contains the name of the person licensed to sell guns and the business itself. The leader of an organization of firearms retailers had a lower estimate of how many gun shops there are nationally. Andrew Molchan, president of Professional Gun Retailers Association, believes there are probably 9,000 "real" gun stores in America. His definition of a gun store is a place that regularly sells the weapons year-round. His estimate did not include businesses such as Wal-Mart because some of those stores do not sell any guns. Molchan said it’s tough to come up with a firm number of how many gun stores there are for several reasons. For example, he said some pawnshops sell only a handful of guns year-round. "It’s not hard and crisp," Molchan said of coming up with an actual estimate of how many gun shops there are in the U.S. When told about Hutchins’ claim, Molchan replied, "That’s not necessarily wrong." Some people, he said, may have a license to sell guns, but they don’t sell any at all. He believes there are probably as many as 25,000 businesses that sell guns. To sum up, Hutchins said there were twice as many gun shops than McDonald’s restaurants in the United States. There are numbers we found that support his argument. But this claim, like many we’ve tackled, is not as simple as it seems. His overall point seems accurate -- there are a lot of places to buy guns in the United States. Our rating: Mostly True.

pomt-07256	The Democratic health care law "added 12 years of solvency to Medicare."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/may/27/debbie-wasserman-schultz/did-health-care-law-add-12-years-solvency-medicare/	Ever heard of Medi-scare? It’s political slang that means attacking opponents for their plans to rein in Medicare spending. Republicans say they’re victims of Medi-scare because Democrats keep distorting their recent proposal, a plan to turn Medicare into a program where seniors buy their own health insurance plans and the federal government pays part of the tab. The plan wouldn’t apply to anyone 55 or older, but would start for new enrollees in 2022. Still, it would be a dramatic change from the current system, where the government pays doctors and hospitals directly. A Democrat won a close special election in upstate New York on May 24 after campaigning against the plan, prompting Republicans to complain that Democrats were demagoguing the plan. Boo hoo, say Democrats like Debbie Wasserman Schultz. It was just last year that Republicans tried to scare seniors by telling them the health care law would gut Medicare spending, said Wasserman Schultz, who was recently named head of the Democratic National Committee. "It's the pot calling the kettle black when it comes to who's engaging in Medi-scare," said Wasserman Schultz in an interview on MSNBC on May 25. "The Republicans leading up to the 2010 election actually fabricated what Democrats did to Medicare. In fact, we added 12 years of solvency to Medicare and ensured that it would be better for seniors overall. And what the Republicans have done under Paul Ryan's plan is actually end Medicare as we know it, turn into it into a voucher program. There's no running from that." We documented a slew of Mediscare ads against Democrats during the 2010 election cycle. But we were interested in the wonkier question of whether the health care law did indeed add 12 years of solvency to Medicare. Solvency in this case means the money flowing into Medicare covers 100 percent of the bills for patient care. We started researching the issue, and at first, Wasserman Schultz seemed on solid ground. In August 2010, the Medicare Board of Trustees reported that the health care law did indeed add 12 years of solvency to Medicare Part A, the portion of Medicare that covers hospitalization. It also improved the financial outlook for Part B, which covers physicians’ services and other care. The report specifically credited the Democratic health care law, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, passed earlier that year. We should note those estimates come with a few warnings. The report itself says that projecting health care costs into the future includes many uncertainties. Additionally, the report doesn’t include changes that Congress will likely make to current law, especially the predictable increases in payments to physicians known as the doc fix. Also, the independent chief actuary for Medicare questioned whether the projected cost savings were realistic. But overall, the board of trustees report is an official estimate for the Medicare program, the reports are put together with a consistent, detailed methodology, and its annual reports are usually referred to by both parties. The bigger problem with Wasserman Schultz's statement is that just a few weeks ago, the board of trustees issued a new report that revised its estimates for the health care law. Instead of adding 12 years of solvency, the board concluded, the law will only add eight years of solvency. Starting in 2024, the program will need either new revenues or reduced expenses to meet all of its obligations. The board said the shortfall was because of the continuing economic slowdown, which has reduced the Medicare program’s income from taxes, and a few other lesser factors. So Wasserman Schultz’s number is off by about a third. Nevertheless, her overall point, that the Democrats’ health reform law added to the overall solvency of Medicare, is correct. The 2011 report included the same warnings that estimating health care savings for the future is an uncertain process, but it also concluded that the financial outlook for Medicare is "substantially improved as a result of the changes in the Affordable Care Act." The law reduced spending and increased revenues in several ways. It slows increases in payments to hospitals and nursing homes. It raises Medicare hospital taxes for high earners. And it introduces several new programs aimed at steering the health system away from paying doctors and hospitals per procedure ("fee for service") and instead paying for good outcomes. When we contacted her office, a spokesman said that the number may have been off, but the point was still right. "The important thing is that Democrats moved to substantially extend the life of the Medicare Trust Fund while also making broad improvements to Medicare," said spokesman Jonathan Beeton. To summarize, Wasserman Schultz said that the Democratic health care law "added 12 years of solvency to Medicare." She’s off on the number, citing an older, more optimistic report. The latest estimate indicates Medicare will only have eight additional years of solvency, one-third less than the previous estimate.

pomt-04037	Says according to the FBI, more people are killed each year with hammers and clubs than rifles.	true	/texas/statements/2013/jan/30/greg-abbott/greg-abbott-says-according-fbi-more-people-are-kil/	Not long before President Barack Obama’s Jan. 16, 2013, speech calling for more gun control measures, Texas’ attorney general tweeted about a different class of assault weapons. Greg Abbott wrote, "FBI: More people killed with hammers & clubs each year than rifles," and supplied a link to a Jan. 3, 2013, Fox News commentary piece that originated on Breitbart.com and referred to FBI murder statistics from 2005 through 2011. PolitiFact in Washington, D.C., recently tackled a similar claim culled from Facebook: Obama was on the record supporting bans on certain semi-automatic rifles before his Jan. 16 speech, in which he again called for renewing the 1994-2004 federal "assault weapons" ban while urging education, mental health and other measures to reduce gun violence. Like Abbott’s tweet, the Facebook post cited the FBI. PolitiFact looked at the bureau’s annual report on "Crime in the United States," a collection of data from local agencies on several categories of crimes. The Facebook post earned a "True" rating because it reflected the FBI’s statistics from 2011, the most recent year available, for murders with knives (1,694), personal weapons (728, typed on Facebook as 726), blunt objects (496) and rifles (323). The Facebook post did not include homicides the FBI attributed to handguns (6,220), firearms whose type was not stated (1,587) and "other guns" (97). Those numbers mean handguns were used in 72 percent of all firearm murders in 2011 and slightly under half of all murders using any kind of weapon that year. Abbott’s tweet, similarly, did not include some FBI-tracked categories by referring solely to rifles and blunt objects and leaving out other significant firearm categories. Still, according to the FBI’s data covering 2005 through 2011, blunt objects such as clubs and hammers were consistently used to murder more people than rifles alone. FBI homicide data 2005-2011, ranked in order of weapons used most often in 2011: Our ruling Like an older Facebook item, Abbott’s tweet uses data selectively, ignoring the significant role of handguns in gun violence. That said, it is correct that FBI data indicates that in 2011, more people were killed with "clubs and hammers" than with any type of rifle. We rate his statement as True.

pomt-07380	"You’ve got each day 10,000 new seniors, baby boomers, becoming eligible for the entitlement programs."	true	/virginia/statements/2011/may/04/eric-cantor/rep-eric-cantor-says-10000-baby-boomers-day-are-be/	Amid the pop of champagne at the start of 2011, you many not have noticed the beginnings of a monumental event that will reshape America. The first baby boomers turned 65. Every day this year, and for the next 18 years, multitudes more will turn 65 and begin to rely on the nation’s already-stressed entitlement programs. Baby boomers are Americans born between Jan. 1, 1946 and Dec. 31, 1964. Their 65th birthdays mark the beginning of eligibility for Medicare and fall one year before their full qualification for Social Security. House Majority Leader Eric Cantor has been blanketing cable networks to promote the House GOP budget and the need for major spending cuts. His effort comes as Congress and the president grapple with both the 2012 federal budget and more immediate need to raise the debt ceiling. Appearing on CNBC April 27, Cantor, R-Va., said "you’ve got each day 10,000 new seniors, baby boomers, becoming eligible for the entitlement programs. Ten thousand a day." Is Cantor’s number right? We asked Megan Whittemore, Cantor’s press secretary, where the congressman came up with the figure of 10,000 seniors a day becoming eligible for entitlements. She pointed us to a series of statements and reports by the Social Security Administration. In October 2007, when the first baby boomer claimed early retirement benefits from Social Security, the agency put out a press release. Kathleen Casey-Kirschling, born one second after midnight on Jan. 1, 1946, qualified for payments in January 2008, the agency said, adding that "over the next two decades, nearly 80 million Americans will become eligible for Social Security benefits, more than 10,000 per day." Social Security allows recipients to start claiming benefits at age 62, though that means accepting a lower monthly payout. The full retirement age for boomers born in 1954 or earlier is 66. It then increases by two months in each of the next six birth years, with everyone born 1960 or later getting full benefits at age 67. Retirees can choose to defer payments up until they’re 70, receiving a larger monthly check in return. The Social Security agency also referred to the 10,000-a-day statistic in its report for fiscal 2012. The Pew Research Center highlighted the statistic in a 2010 study on baby boomers. According to Census data gathered by Pew, 76 million people were born in the United States during the generation. After subtracting those who have already died and adding immigrants born during those years, the Census estimates there are roughly 79.6 million people aged 45 to 64 in America. If you divide 79.6 million by 19 years, then divide that by 365 days, you get 11,478. That’s the number of people, on average, who will turn 65 each day for the next 19 years. Obviously not everyone in that category will live to 65, but the math clearly gives you a figure above the 10,000-a-day cited by Cantor. We also checked the Social Security awards given in 2010. According to the SSA, 4.05 million retired workers or survivors of deceased workers started getting payments last year. That means 11,102 people each day began receiving checks. In 2009 the number was slightly higher, at 11,436 per day. Right now, about 8,600 people a day enter Social Security through the traditional retirement program, and another 3,000 each day through the programs for families of disabled or deceased workers. If the head count climbs up to 11,400 per day through the traditional program, plus another 3,000 per day through the programs for families of disabled or deceased workers, that’s almost a 25 percent increase in the number of Social Security beneficiaries. And consider this: In 1950, as Social Security ramped up, there were 16 workers per recipient. Today there are 2.9 workers per recipient, and by 2041 the SSA says there will be just 2.1 workers per recipient. Let’s review. Rep. Eric Cantor said 10,000 Americans per day become eligible for entitlement programs, meaning Social Security and Medicare. His number are borne out in projections and data from the Social Security Administration. During 2009 and 2010 ,the number of Social Security recipients was actually above 11,000 per day, though many of those people were not retirees. Census data show nearly 80 million baby boomers, born over a span of 19 years. They will turn 65 and become eligible for Medicare at a rate of 11,478 per day. In fact, as of May 3 an estimated 1.4 million people have turned 65 this year. The numbers are staggering. We rate Cantor’s statement True.

pomt-02834	"All" University of Texas "student-athletes get an iPad."	mostly false	/texas/statements/2013/nov/22/jody-conradt/university-texas-student-athletes-may-borrow-limit/	Speaking against paying student-athletes, a long-time Texas Longhorn official said sports scholarships already include special benefits. Jody Conradt, a University of Texas special assistant, said during a Sept. 28, 2013, Texas Tribune Festival panel discussion on the UT campus: "I have to make one point. We’re not just talking about a scholarship as defined by scholarship. We’re talking about the money spent, unlimited tutors, unlimited access to athletic training; all of your injury issues are taken care of. You can get money to go home at Christmas if that is an emergency… You can get clothes, through a program called the Student Athlete Opportunity Fund." Conradt, who coached the UT women’s basketball team for 31 years, continued: "So over time there have been ways to give more benefit to student-athletes that is not what people consider the scholarship." For instance, she said, "all... student athletes get an iPad. They get a lot of things that the normal student does not." Most of those declared benefits didn’t surprise us. But does each UT student-athlete get the popular Apple iPad tablet (which were retailing for about $180 to $500, depending on screen sizes and other features, when we online window-shopped this November)? Nick Voinis, UT’s senior associate athletic director, told us by phone that UT’s student-athletes, who numbered 551 as of mid-November, may borrow iPads, Amazon Kindles and other electronic equipment thanks to a fund created by the National Collegiate Athletic Association, the governing body for intercollegiate athletics. Voinis stressed that many student-athletes come to school already having computers, laptops or iPads. Still, he said, the option is there for those students to check out a laptop or iPad. "Some check them out for a day or two, some for a semester," Voinis said, or the full year. He said the programs keeps 30 tablets, mostly iPads, available for checkout. For the year that started in August 2013, Voinis said, nearly $338,000 flowed from the NCAA to UT’s Student Athlete Opportunity Fund. Those dollars, he said, could be spent on computers, laptops, iPads, school supplies and other items such as university fees not covered by scholarships, including emergency trips home. That’s correct, a NCAA official told us. According to an Aug. 22, 2012, online post by the NCAA, the association and its member schools in 2010-11 paid more than $53 million to more than 81,000 student-athletes. "The money, which comes from the NCAA’s Student Assistance Fund, paid for trips home, clothing, summer school, tutoring, graduate test fees, health insurance and countless other costs that scholarships don’t cover," the NCAA said. "A version of the Student Assistance Fund was first offered in 1999, after the NCAA inked a $6 billion broadcast deal with CBS. The decision to start the fund came from the NCAA’s desire to give back to student-athletes more directly than through grants or other forms of aid that are often laden with restrictions. The fund has grown each year since its inception." By email, NCAA spokeswoman Stacey Osburn pointed out an association rule (15.01.6.1) restricting how such aid is spent. The rule says universities shall not tap such aid to finance salaries, grants-in-aid (other than summer school) for student-athletes with remaining eligibility, capital improvements, stipends and outside athletics development opportunities for student-athletes (e.g., participation in a sports camp or clinic, private sports-related instruction, greens fees, batting cage rental, outside foreign tour expenses)." So iPads are permitted, it looked to us. We recognized another way that some student-athletes land iPads--as gifts to participants in football bowl games. Players in the 2012 Valero Alamo Bowl, which was won by the Texas Longhorns, received $550 worth of gifts including an iPad Mini, bowl spokesman Rick Hill told us by phone. Our ruling Conradt said all UT student-athletes get an iPad. That’s not so, though less than 30 iPads are available for UT’s 500-plus student-athletes to borrow for up to a year at a time.

pomt-13639	"The Obama-Clinton war on coal has cost Michigan over 50,000 jobs."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/aug/09/donald-trump/donald-trump-exaggerates-michigan-job-losses-coal-/	During an economic address at the Detroit Economic Club, Donald Trump tailored some of his statistics to the local audience. "As a result of recent Obama EPA actions, coal-fired plants across Michigan have either shut down entirely or undergone expensive conversions, making them non-competitive in many cases," Trump said. "The Obama-Clinton war on coal has cost Michigan over 50,000 jobs." Trump has often criticized efforts by the Obama administration -- and those who find climate change to be a serious concern -- to wean the United States from fossil fuels by tightening federal environmental regulation of coal-fired power plants. Here, we’ll take a look at the second part of Trump’s statement: "The Obama-Clinton war on coal has cost Michigan over 50,000 jobs." This assertion initially caught our eye because we’d never thought of Michigan as one of the premier coal-producing states. Our suspicion was correct: According to the National Mining Association, Michigan is not on the list of 26 states that currently produce any amount of coal. Meanwhile, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the number of workers engaged in any type of mining in Michigan over the last decade has varied between 5,000 and 7,000, making it essentially impossible to have lost 50,000 existing jobs in that sector. And as the Washington Examiner has noted, Michigan has fewer than 20,000 people working in the electricity generation sector today. So the scale of the job losses Trump cites seem, at least at first blush, to be unlikely. So what was Trump trying to say? The prepared version of his speech includes a footnote that points to a news release from the National Mining Association published almost five years ago, on Sept. 7, 2011. Here are some excerpts from that news release, which criticized "Beyond Coal," a campaign against coal-fired power plants coordinated by the environmental group the Sierra Club and cited a study the group released: "The destructive impact of the ‘Beyond Coal’ campaign is most clearly evident in the following 10 states where power plants blocked by the club represent the highest number of potential jobs (construction and permanent) foregone: Illinois (126,612), Texas (122,065), Montana (114,102), Nevada (75,194), Florida (75,055), Ohio (70,371), Colorado (55,620), Michigan (53,587), Oklahoma (42,581) and Kentucky (38,824)." In response to an inquiry from PolitiFact, Andrew Wheeler, an energy adviser to the Trump campaign, also pointed to a U.S. Chamber of Commerce analysis that found that 10 delayed or canceled projects in Michigan -- most of them coal-fired plants -- would have created 56,000 jobs up front had they been built. Between the 53,000 jobs cited by the National Mining Association and the 56,000 jobs cited by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, Wheeler said, "it is obvious that the ‘over 50,000 jobs’ cited by Mr. Trump is accurate." But just because a campaign is able to footnote a specific number doesn’t mean that the number is meaningful, or as fully contextualized as it ought to be. Here are a few important things to know about this number. • The number refers to "potential" jobs lost, not actual jobs lost. This is an important point that would not be obvious from the way Trump phrased his statement. By leaving the impression that these were actual jobs lost, Trump’s statistic invites a degree of outrage that isn’t warranted. And there are good reasons to be cautious about future job projections, especially when they have been framed so broadly as to include vendors to the industry, rail transport, ports and machinery manufacturers. Any job projections of this sort are subject to rosy estimates -- especially if a group has a vested interest in the issue. In making an argument to the public, all groups will put forward their most favorable case. Trey Pollard, the national press secretary for the Sierra Club -- which has its own dog in the fight -- said the number of plants being counted by the mining association are essentially "the coal industry’s wildest dreams" -- a reflection of circumstances in which they can build coal plants "in any community they want to." • The number doesn’t reflect that coal is increasingly being replaced by natural gas. Trump’s decision to use this number tells only part of the story of how the electricity sector has been developing. In recent years, according to federal statistics, coal has been losing ground to natural gas and, to a lesser extent, renewable energy when it comes to electricity generation. A July 2016 analysis by Sam Evans of the School of Business and Economics at King University in Bristol, Tenn., found that environmental regulation has been a factor in this switch, but a "secondary" one. "The recent decline in the generation share of coal, and the concurrent rise in the share of natural gas, was mainly a market-driven response to lower natural gas prices that have made natural gas generation more economically attractive," Evans wrote. • This isn’t just about Obama or Clinton. Trump ignores that much of the impetus in Michigan for switching away from coal has come from the state’s Republican governor, Rick Snyder, and from utilities themselves. Snyder has generally continued his support for steps to shift away from coal that began under his Democratic predecessor as governor, Jennifer Granholm. In 2015, Snyder said at an energy conference that "now is the time to look at a long-term transition away from coal," adding that because of the state’s natural gas infrastructure, "we're well positioned to actually have a fair amount of that coal demand go to natural gas." And Gerry Anderson, the chairman and CEO of DTE Energy, an electric utility that serves more than 2 million customers in the state, has written that "we plan to retire older, less efficient coal plants and build new, cleaner natural gas power plants over the next decade." Our ruling Trump said that "the Obama-Clinton war on coal has cost Michigan over 50,000 jobs." However, this claim is problematic on several levels. While the number matches one projection of how many potential jobs could be lost from the blockage of coal-fired plants, there’s a difference between actual jobs lost and potential future jobs lost. And the number cited -- an impossible-to-confirm projection based on broadly construed calculations released by a pro-coal group -- should be taken with a big grain of salt. Trump also ignores that market forces, not just environmental regulations, have driven many of the job losses in the coal sector, and he also ignores that Michigan Republican officials and utilities themselves -- not just the Obama administration -- have pushed the switch away from coal. We rate the claim False. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/5237e30a-995b-4c02-a36c-e160efe29dfa	None	Donald Trump	None	None	None	2016-08-09T16:50:56	2016-08-08	['Michigan']
pomt-11408	"Newspapers have framed this election as my fight against the Illinois mafia."	false	/illinois/statements/2018/mar/21/bruce-rauner/rauner-cites-own-remarks-proof-outside-support-ele/	Incumbent Gov. Bruce Rauner struck a number of familiar notes in his speech Tuesday night as he claimed a narrow primary victory over insurgent Republican challenger Jeanne Ives, talking about tax cuts, job growth and term limits for elected leaders. But the multi-millionaire Rauner also sought to frame his coming general election battle against Democratic nominee J.B. Pritzker as one pitting the interests of the little guy against entrenched political insiders allied with the billionaire Pritzker. Then Rauner threw in a new wrinkle to his standard line of attack. "Newspapers have framed this election as my fight against the Illinois mafia," he told the applauding crowd. "But it’s really the people versus the Illinois mafia." Rauner has long been free with tossing around incendiary terms to describe rivals, in particularly Illinois House Speaker Michael Madigan, whom the governor frequently lambastes as "corrupt." But this latest turn of phrase, which Rauner attributed not to himself but "newspapers," got us to wondering. Which newspapers? A look in the mirror So we reached out to his campaign for an answer. A spokesman quickly responded by emailing a link to a single opinion column published a few weeks ago in the Wall Street Journal titled, "Bruce Rauner vs. the Illinois ‘Mafia.’" In the piece, which represents the views of a single columnist and not the paper’s editorial board, Rauner pins Illinois’ problems squarely on Madigan. The Journal quotes Rauner referring to his archrival as "the mafia kingpin of Illinois" and then taking an additional swipe at Madigan for simultaneously serving as a powerful lawmaker and as a partner in a law firm specializing in property tax appeals. "It’s a mafia protection racket," Rauner said of Madigan’s dual roles. But the ‘mafia’ references in the headline and column come from Rauner’s own mouth, not from the impressions of the writer, who also goes on to note that: "Mr. Rauner sounds confident and plans to spend whatever it takes to make the election a referendum on reform versus the Madigan Mafia." Rauner campaign aides did not respond to our follow-up email asking whether they believed other newspapers had framed the election in similar terms. Our ruling After barely squeaking out a victory over a primary challenger, Gov. Bruce Rauner declared to supporters that, "Newspapers have framed this election as my fight against the Illinois mafia." Incendiary rhetoric has been a staple of Rauner speeches for years, but in upping the ante even more in his fight against Pritzker it appears the governor is also projecting his own words onto the thoughts of others. Newspapers, or more precisely one column in the Wall Street Journal, did not frame Rauner’s re-election fight in terms of a struggle with a mafia-like force. That is Rauner’s own characterization and he is simply quoting himself while seeking to attribute the observation to others. This dizzying feedback loop earns Rauner’s primary night claim a False.

pomt-07073	In the first 24 to 36 hours of the operation in Libya, "you saw $115 million go downrange because a Tomahawk cruise missile is a little over $1 million each."	mostly true	/florida/statements/2011/jun/27/allen-west/allen-west-says-military-spent-115-million-first-3/	War is hell. War is expensive. And we can attempt to quantify just how expensive it is. That's what Republican U.S. Rep. Allen West, an Army veteran who now represents part of Broward and Palm Beach counties, did in a June 20, 2011 interview on Fox News. West has been critical of the U.S. military actions in Libya launched in March. In a Miami Herald/St. Petersburg Times article on June 23, West was quoted as saying "We can't keep committing U.S. military to 'protect innocent civilians'; they're exhausted." He went into more detail on Fox News in response to a question about whether President Barack Obama would have gotten authorization from Congress to launch the operation, West responded: "Well, the thing is this. You have got to be able to explain what the mission is. And being 22 years in the United States military, we have seen three different missions being stated. First of all, we're going to protect innocent civilians. Kind of hard to do that from 30,000 feet. The next thing, we say we're going to go in and attack the military capability of (Moammar) Gadhafi. Really hard to do between the vehicles of the rebels and his vehicles. And now we want to take Moammar Gadhafi out of power. There are means by which we can restrict and constrain and kind of temper Moammar Gadhafi without coming back again and having a third combat operation. And you want to talk about the economics of this, in the first 24 to 36 hours, you saw $115 million go downrange because a Tomahawk cruise missile is a little over $1 million each." For this Truth-O-Meter item, we wondered if West got his numbers right. How much does the Tomahawk cruise missile cost and did we spend $115 million in the first 24 to 36 hours on missiles in Libya? And what if anything can we draw from that initial cost? Navy spokeswoman Amanda Greenberg told us in a June 23 interview that a Tomahawk cruise missile costs approximately $1.1 million. During the first 24 to 36 hours, 110 were fired by Coalition forces -- the majority by the U.S, she said. That math works out to about $121 million. West's spokeswoman Angela Sachitano directed us to a March 23 article in the National Journal which states: "On the first day of strikes alone, U.S.-led forces launched 112 long-range Tomahawk cruise missiles, which cost about $1 million to $1.5 million apiece, from ships stationed off the Libyan coast. That totaled $112 million to $168 million. Since those first strikes, U.S. and British forces have launched at least another 12 Tomahawk missiles. The Defense Department typically buys about 200 Tomahawks a year. While the military likely can put off buying new missiles for months, it will ultimately need to boost planned procurement rates to refill its stockpile." The tab in Libya continues to rise. That's a concern among Democrats and Republicans who have opposed the conflict that the Obama administration entered without seeking Congressional authority. Whether Obama violated the 1973 War Powers Resolution is the topic of a separate June 22, 2011 article on PolitiFact. The White House said in a report that as of June 3, the cost of the Libya operation was about $716 million. By Sept. 30, or 90 days into the conflict, that figure is expected to rise to about $1.1 billion. West's numbers about the first day and a half are clearly on target or close enough. But what do they mean? We interviewed four experts including Gordon Adams, a professor of foreign policy at American University who was associate director for national security and international affairs at the federal Office of Management and Budget in the 1990s. We also interviewed Zack Cooper, senior analyst at the nonpartisan Center for Strategic Budgetary Assessments who co-wrote a report in March about the costs of a no-fly zone in Libya published before the conflict started. Our additional experts were James Phillips, senior research fellow for Middle Eastern affairs at the conservative Heritage Foundation, and Michael O'Hanlon, a senior fellow in foreign policy at the left-leaning Brookings Institution. None of our experts quibbled with West's numbers. But some said the cost from the first day and half doesn't shed much light on the big picture. "His numbers are right but it doesn't mean anything," Adams said, because the government already bought those missiles and would ultimately use them somewhere. "We've already got them in the inventory -- it's not a new expenditure," Adams said. The government won't necessarily replace each Tomahawk missile that it used in Libya, Adams said. And that initial cost "doesn't tell you anything" about how much will ultimately be spent because we don't know how long the operation will continue or the operational tempo. Cooper's report estimated the initial and longer-term costs of creating different types of no-fly zones. For a limited no-fly zone covering mostly northern Libya, the report estimated upfront costs between $400 and $800 million and ultimately between $1.18 and $3.4 billion over six months. "The initial costs in these sorts of operations are typically higher in the first stages of the operations because more expensive munitions are being used and there are a high number of targets at the outset of combat operations," Cooper said in an e-mail. It's not helpful to compare the cost in the first day and a half in Libya to other conflicts, Cooper said. For some broader conflicts where the initial start-up time is at least multiple days and can include troops on the ground, it's harder to pinpoint the costs compared to the cost of dropping a certain number of bombs and multiplying the cost of each bomb. For other conflicts including some of the no-fly zones "they start small and sort of build so initial costs may be relatively small but costs over time may be large." "I think the Libya situation is anomolous," Cooper said. So can we draw any meaning from the costs in Libya the first 36 hours? "The cost of the first day or first couple of days was largely Tomahawk missiles and maybe some other munitions, but for the most part that's why it was so expensive," Cooper said. "The cost in the long term of a no-fly zone is typically fuel and operational costs so the two are very different. The upfront cost of imposing a no-fly zone are typically substantially higher than the week-to-week cost of flying planes above Libyan territory." On Fox News West said that the United States launched about $115 million worth of missiles within the first day or day and a half in Libya. That's about $6 million less than the figure we received from the Navy. And West didn't note that some of the Tomahawks were fired by U.S. allies. But still, close enough. But there are a couple of caveats -- namely, that the U.S. already had those missiles in stock, so it doesn't represent new spending. And initial costs in a military intervention are always higher, experts told us. We rate this claim Mostly True.	None	Allen West	None	None	None	2011-06-27T10:55:40	2011-06-20	['Libya']

pomt-11088	"When you tally up their representation in Congress and governorships, the Democrats almost have their lowest representation in about 100 years."	true	/punditfact/statements/2018/jun/15/fareed-zakaria/yes-democratic-party-nearly-its-weakest-point-cent/	While the Democratic Party held the White House for two terms during Barack Obama’s presidency, much of the country was turning a deeper shade of red. Republicans made dramatic down-ballot gains over the past decade, a trend that may have been overlooked somewhat given Democratic control of the executive branch for most of this time. But as the party vies to recapture the House and Senate from the GOP in upcoming midterm elections, the roots of Democrats’ recent losses are being reexamined. "Unless Democrats face up to this reality and devise a strategy to reverse this tidal wave of defeat, they might find themselves surprised one more time this November," said CNN’s Fareed Zakaria. "When you tally up their representation in Congress, state legislatures and governorships, the Democrats almost have their lowest representation in about 100 years." This stat, from the June 10 broadcast of his CNN show, was depicted in a graphic showing each of the two major parties’ power shifts since 1920 in Congress, governorships and state legislatures. (Source: CNN) The chart shows an ebb and flow of the parties’ power over roughly the past 100 years. The high-water mark of Democratic representation came during the New Deal era. But overall, the century is bookended with Democrats in positions of relative weakness. Zakaria is right: The Democratic Party is at nearly its weakest point in a century. Methodology Zakaria’s broader point was that center-left politics are in decline not only in the United States, but across the Western world. He cited a book by Barnard College Sheri Berman, "Why the Left Loses," which posits several explanatory factors: center-left parties field weak leaders; they shoulder the blame (fairly or not) when the post-World War II liberal order fails, as in the 2008 global financial crisis; and they’ve embraced a politics of identity that alienates large swaths of the electorate. A central premise to Zakaria’s argument was the statistic about Democrats’ near-historically low influence in Congress and at the state level. A CNN spokeswoman said Zakaria had been relying on a Real Clear Politics analysis of more than a century of data, as well as a piece in 538.com. We contacted the RCP researchers Sean Trende and David Byler (who is now with the Weekly Standard), who shared their dataset with us. Zakaria deviated slightly from their methodology (he omitted partisan data on presidents), but the down-ballot numbers seem to back up his point about Democrats’ waning power. "Zakaria’s chart doesn’t include presidential performance, which is included in our original metric," Trende said. "That wouldn’t, however, alter the basic conclusion, and his findings are a fair representation of our research." To establish their partisan power index, Trende and Byler devised a points system for Democrats’ and Republicans’ performance in five electoral categories: president, House, Senate, state legislatures and gubernatorial performance. They added the five metrics together for each party, at two-year intervals. The party with the higher number had more power relative to the other. Byler noted a couple caveats. For starters, the dataset ends at the 2016 election. Furthermore, the researchers made certain judgment calls that resulted in the index not tracking exactly with election results. For example, Janet Napolitano won the 2006 Arizona gubernatorial election, but left relatively soon after the 2008 election to join the Obama administration. That meant Jan Brewer, a Republican, was in office for much of 2009-11. Under the RCP index, we found three historical instances where Democrats held a weaker position, relative to Republicans, than they did following the 2016 election: in 1920, 1926 and 1928. Given Zakaria’s hedging — he said Democrats almost have their lowest representation in about 100 years — we think his claim passes muster. Congress The RCP data shows the Democrats’ Senate representation was weakest in 1920 during the Republican presidency of Warren G. Harding. At that point, the GOP held a 59-37 seat advantage — with Democrats holding 10 fewer seats than they do today. (Technically, Democrats currently hold 47 seats, though two Independent senators — Bernie Sanders of Vermont and Angus King of Maine — caucus with the Democrats, giving Republicans a razor-thin 51-seat majority.) See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com To get another view of the historical data, we turned to the Brookings Institution’s Vital Statistics on Congress, which tracks election results (again, the RCP data is not precisely pegged to election results). According to Brookings, there were nine other instances where Democrats held fewer Senate seats than they do today: 1921 (37), 1923 (43), 1925 (40), 1929 (39), 1947 (45), 1997 and 1999 (45 each), 2005 (44) and 2015 (44). As in the Senate, the 1920s were a rough decade for House Democrats. The party’s weakest showing in the House was in 1920, when Democrats held 131 seats to Republicans’ 303, according to RCP data. See Figure 2 on PolitiFact.com Brookings data shows six other instances when Democrats held fewer than the 193 seats they boast today. State legislatures At the state legislative level, Democrats have ceded enormous power to Republicans over the past decade. In 2008, Democrats controlled twice as many legislatures as the GOP (24-14). But Democrats’ fortunes began to reverse with their 2010 midterm "shellacking" (to borrow Obama’s phrase). See Figure 3 on PolitiFact.com John Mahoney, a policy specialist at the National Conference of State Legislatures, said it was accurate to say Democrats are at near-historical lows in this arena. "There are currently 3,125 Ds serving in state legislatures, which is the lowest since 1928 when there were 3,057 Ds serving," Mahoney said. "The lowest ever (since 1900) Democratic representation in the states was in 1920 when only 2,545 Ds were serving in state legislatures." Governor’s mansion A look at Democrats’ standing in governships over the past decade shows a similarly declining trend, placing the party in one of its weakest positions over the past century. Democrats now hold 16 governors mansions, compared to 33 controlled by Republicans. (Gov. Bill Walker of Alaska is an Independent.) See Figure 4 on PolitiFact.com According to RCP data, the only time Democrats had a weaker standing in the past 100 years was in 1920, when they controlled a mere 14 governorships. One thing to remember As we have noted in the past, the Democratic decline under Obama that produced the current low point was unusually big, but it was hardly unprecedented. Since World War II, no two-term president (or presidential tag team) has ever gained Senate seats, House seats, governorships, or state legislative chambers over an eight-year period. Rather, every single presidency has suffered substantial losses in each of those categories over the past seven decades. There has literally been no upside in down-ballot races for presidents as far back as Franklin D. Roosevelt. Our ruling Zakaria said, "When you tally up their representation in Congress, state legislatures and governorships, the Democrats almost have their lowest representation in about 100 years." Democrats wield less power than Republicans in each of these offices. In the 1920s, they had an even weaker standing relative to the GOP than they do today. But Zakaria hedged his bets by saying Democrats almost have their lowest representation in about 100 years — and the numbers appear to back him up. We rate this True.

pomt-03557	"Forty-six cents of every dollar" Ohio could get for Medicaid expansion "is going to come from China or some other country that doesn’t like us very much."	false	/ohio/statements/2013/may/22/ron-maag/rep-ron-maag-says-46-percent-medicaid-expansion-mo/	Free money from Washington sure sounds enticing. But State Rep. Ron Maag, a Southwest Ohio Republican, says he doesn’t believe it’s really free. That’s one reason Maag does not want Ohio to expand Medicaid, the joint federal-state healthcare program for low-income Americans. The expansion money would come from the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, or Obamacare, providing states with Medicaid cash to enroll residents earning up to 138 percent of the poverty level. The federal government would provide full funding for the first three years, and then 90 percent. Besides skepticism about how much more Ohio might ultimately have to cover, Maag, of Warren County, doubts the federal government can really afford its portion, either. "Forty-six cents of every dollar that we would be getting from Washington, D.C., is going to come from China or some other country that doesn’t like us very much," he said at an Ohio House Finance and Appropriations Committee hearing on April 12. Plenty of Ohio Republicans have doubts about expanding Medicaid, but Maag’s statement stood out because it sounded contrary to federal assessments about the program’s financing. So we asked Maag to explain his claim. He told us in a telephone interview that the federal government already borrows 46 cents of every dollar it spends. He based that on a Congressional Budget Office, or CBO, report issued in December. The CBO report that Maag cited was a monthly review that showed the amount of money the government had spent (the outlays) so far in the fiscal year; the amount of revenue it took in (chiefly from taxes), and the difference between the two. The difference was in the negative column. That means the government had a deficit and must borrow to cover it. Divide the deficit by the outlays and you get the figure Maag stated -- 46 cents of every dollar spent as of that moment was deficit spending. That is not a projection, Maag said. "It’s an absolute." It was, at least, last December. And the percentage figure, 46, was high, prompting the Washington Times and several other media outlets to report it. But this CBO budget report covered a relatively narrow time frame, only two months. What would happen if you looked at a broader period, using the most current CBO report, issued May 7? Or the April report that was issued a week before Maag spoke? The deficit figure would change -- or, rather, it has changed. The CBO monthly review issued on April 5 provided figures for the first six months of the current fiscal year. They showed a lower level of deficits: 34 cents for every dollar of federal spending. Why had the deficit figure gone down? Part of it was due to more tax activity from an improving economy. Revenues were about 12 percent higher than for the same period in 2012 and spending was 3 percent lower, the CBO said. This was not a fluke. Subsequent CBO reports have noted the same thing: As the economy has improved, tax revenues have gone up and deficits down. OK, so the deficits are shrinking and Maag had not yet read the latest monthly CBO figures. (Doesn’t everyone in the Ohio General Assembly?) Let’s put aside the exact figure, for it is still a deficit. What about Maag’s broader point -- that Medicaid expansion under Obamacare would result in more deficit spending? That is not what the CBO -- the same nonpartisan office whose work Maag mentioned in defending part of this claim -- projects. The CBO has examined this several times, working with the bipartisan Joint Committee on Taxation. Obamacare has costs, chiefly the cost of expanding health coverage with Medicaid and with subsidies for individuals and small employers who lack insurance, cannot afford it and cannot qualify for Medicaid. But it also has savings. Some of the savings are supposed to come from reducing the amount of money the federal government now pays to hospitals to care for the uninsured. In Ohio alone, the government will pay hospitals $7.4 billion less over the next 10 years, according to testimony to state lawmakers from Mike Abrams, president and CEO of the Ohio Hospital Association. Additionally, the federal government will get money from taxes on high-premium or "Cadillac" health care policies, from taxes on medical device sales, from penalties on employers who fail to provide insurance and, according to projections, from cuts and efficiencies geared to slow the growth rate of Medicare, the federal program for seniors. When the Affordable Care Act passed in 2010, the CBO said the net savings would reduce deficits over 10 years by $143 billion. The CBO has taken a few additional swipes at this, and each time its projections show deficit reduction. When asked last year to examine what would happen if Obamacare were repealed, the CBO said deficits would grow by $109 billion between 2012 and 2022. Even though government costs would go down if Obamacare were repealed, so would the revenue and savings built into the health care bill. So we circle back to Maag’s claim that "Forty-six cents of every dollar that we would be getting from Washington, D.C. would come from China or some other country that doesn’t like us very much." His number was wrong and out of date. The CBO, whose projections both parties rely on, says deficits will go down, not up. We need not take up the last part of his sentence -- that the money would come from countries like China or others who don’t like the United States very much. But for the record, the Pentagon said last year that it does not view China’s holding of United States debt as a threat. Maag’s instincts tell him he is right. But the facts, projections and law, as they exist today, do not support his claim. We rate it False.	None	Ron Maag	None	None	None	2013-05-22T15:58:40	2013-04-12	['China', 'Ohio']

pomt-09798	"Every other democracy in the world has a health care system that covers everybody, and we don't."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/sep/15/howard-dean/dean-says-us-only-democracy-without-universal-heal/	Supporters of health care reform have often said health coverage in the United States lags behind other countries. On the Sept. 13 edition of NBC's Meet the Press , former Vermont Gov. Howard Dean said the United States should meet the standards of its international peers. Dean, who just stepped down after serving as chairman of the Democratic National Committee, said that "America can do anything. Every other democracy in the world has a health care system that covers everybody, and we don't. Of course we can do this. How ridiculous." But is he right that the United States is alone among democracies? No. It is true that most, if not all, industrialized democracies in Western Europe have systems that experts consider universal coverage, as do wealthier countries such as Japan, Australia, New Zealand and Canada. But other democracies fall short, according to international statistics and a half-dozen experts we spoke with. While dozens of countries are classified as democracies, we chose to examine a few that are large and have been politically stable in recent years. Here's the lowdown on their degree of health coverage: -- India. In the cities, and especially for families with means, the medical care ranks among the best in the world. But hundreds of millions of Indians are desperately poor, and about three-quarters live in rural villages. For these Indians, health care is sporadic and substandard. "In theory, India has a publicly financed and publicly provided health care delivery system, aside from its large private sector, that is available at heavily subsidized rates to everyone," said Ajay Mahal, an international health economist at Harvard's School of Public Health. "Thus, one could say that it does have a health system that 'covers' everybody. In practice, however, at least at primary health care facilities in rural areas, doctors and health workers are often absent from work. Drugs tend to be unavailable in many public facilities and there are long lines to contend with at public hospitals. This leads to lots of people opting for private care — and for that they have to pay out of pocket. In this sense you could say that the system does not cover everybody." -- Mexico. The United States' southern neighbor has a constitution that guarantees universal health care, and observers credit the Mexican government with launching Seguro Popular, a federal program that targets the uninsured. For better-off Mexicans, health insurance and facilities are similar to what is found in richer nations. But in practice, the Mexican system falls short of universal coverage. The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, a group of wealthy countries that includes Mexico, reported that in 2007, 65.7 percent of Mexicans had either public or private health insurance. All other OECD countries — except for Turkey (see below) and the United States — either reached 100 percent or came very close to doing so. David C. Warner, a professor of health and social policy at the University of Texas who has studied health care in Mexico, said that "in reality, I would say it falls short" of universal coverage. Mexicans are "guaranteed public health clinics and hospitals, but those tend to be fairly spotty." -- Turkey. The other OECD nation besides the United States to fall short of full coverage is Turkey. The most recent statistics, from 2003, show that 67.2 percent of Turks were covered. A 2008 report by the U.S. Library of Congress found that "the rural population is poorly served by the health care system" and that "workers in Turkey’s large informal economic sector generally lack health coverage." For the past six years, the governing party has been implementing a plan to broaden coverage, so the number has likely risen. "Turkey is in transition to make health care universal," said Mustafa Younis, a health economist at Jackson State University who has studied the Turkish system. A number of other large democratic countries have struggled with carrying out their stated promises to provide universal coverage. In South Africa and the Philippines, for instance, widespread poverty, insufficient health budgets and a shaky medical infrastructure — especially in rural areas — have posed steep challenges, experts say. We called Dean to ask about his comment. A spokeswoman said that the former governor "simply misspoke. He meant to say, as he has for years, that every other industrialized democracy" has universal coverage. If Dean had said that, he'd probably be right. But on Meet the Press , he didn't, so we rate his statement False.	None	Howard Dean	None	None	None	2009-09-15T18:27:53	2009-09-13	['None']
pomt-13026	Says Donald Trump "won more counties than any candidate on our side since Ronald Reagan."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/dec/04/mike-pence/mike-pence-says-donald-trump-won-most-counties-rep/	With a split in the 2016 Electoral College and popular votes, there’s been an unusual amount of jockeying this year over how to frame the Election Day results. On the Dec. 4, 2016, edition of NBC’s Meet the Press, Vice President-elect Mike Pence used the yardstick of counties won to explain why Donald Trump’s victory was a watershed. "To be around Donald Trump, as you know, having known him for a number of years, is to be around a man of boundless energy from literally the day after the election," he said, "a historic election where he won 30 out of 50 states (and) more counties than any candidate on our side since Ronald Reagan." Is this correct? It is, though election experts say it speaks to longtime Republican dominance in rural areas. A closer look at the numbers We were able to secure statistics for counties won by each presidential candidate from Dave Leip, creator of the indispensable "Atlas of U.S. Presidential Elections" website. The following chart shows the breakdown in counties won by each party’s nominee going back to 1984, which was Reagan’s last election as well as the one in which he won every state except one (Minnesota). Two housekeeping notes: The data for 2016 is preliminary, and Alaska doesn’t calculate vote data by borough, which is that state’s equivalent of a county. Election Republican counties won Democratic counties won Independent counties won 2016 2,623 489 0 2012 2,420 693 0 2008 2,238 875 0 2004 2,530 583 0 2000 2,397 659 0 1996 1,587 1,526 0 1992 1,582 1,519 15 1988 2,295 820 0 1984 2,781 334 0 So Pence is on target that the number of counties won by Trump exceeds the number of counties won by every Republican presidential candidate since Reagan in 1984. For a more visual look, here are maps showing the counties won by the parties in each of those elections. Note that the 2016 map, from the Washington Post, uses the now-traditional Democratic blue-Republican red color scheme. 2016 The rest of the maps, from Leip's website, use blue coloring for Republican counties and red coloring for Democratic counties. (For the record, Leip started using his coloring code in 1994, before the current version became standard; he says that changing every map on his site would require an enormous time commitment.) 2012 2008 2004 2000 1996 1992 1988 1984 Trump receives credit from electoral specialists for expanding the Republican footprint, notably in places that had previously backed Barack Obama. According to a calculation by Time magazine, Trump won 220 counties that had voted for Obama in 2012, while Hillary Clinton took far fewer -- 17 -- that had gone for Mitt Romney, the 2012 GOP nominee. And Trump outperformed Romney’s vote share in 2,728 counties, compared to just 383 where Clinton outperformed Obama. But the places where Clinton performed better than Obama did were almost always in much more populous counties. According to Time’s calculations, the counties where Clinton gained ground on Obama had a median of 75,554 voters in 2016. The comparable figure for the counties where Trump exceeded Romney’s performance was 9,905 voters. So the median Clinton-trending county was more than seven times bigger than the median Trump-trending county. The divide doesn’t stop at population. Mark Muro and Sifan Liu of the Brookings Institution crunched the numbers on the overall economic output of Clinton and Trump counties. Their finding? Clinton’s comparatively tiny number of counties "encompassed a massive 64 percent of America’s economic activity," compared to 36 percent for Trump’s much larger stable of counties. Here’s a graphical representation of what they found, with Clinton counties in blue and Trump counties in red, and each county’s rectangle scaled to the size of the output in that county: "Here you can see very clearly that with the exceptions of the Phoenix and Fort Worth areas and a big chunk of Long Island, Clinton won every large-sized county economy in the country," the authors wrote. "Trumpland consists of hundreds and hundreds of tiny low-output locations that comprise the non-metropolitan hinterland of America, along with some suburban and exurban metro counties." All of this illustrates a general pattern for Democrats in recent election cycles: They have run strongly in populous and economically growing urban and suburban areas, but poorly in lightly populated rural areas. This has been true for the entire period we’re looking at -- in fact, Bill Clinton never managed to win more counties during his two victories in the 1990s -- but the partisan disparity has been growing steadily. And the pattern reached a new apogee with the Trump vs. Clinton race. This helps explain why Clinton has so far won 2.6 million more votes than Trump did -- almost 2 percentage points more -- while losing so many counties. "Loving County, Texas, has a population of 82, while California’s Los Angeles County has over 9.8 million," said Costas Panagopoulos, a Fordham University political scientist. "The number of counties won is not necessarily a meaningful indicator, absent any consideration of the population of these counties." Seth Masket, a University of Denver political scientist, agreed. "Partisanship increasingly correlates with urbanism," he said. "There are a lot more rural counties than urban ones, so I'd expect Republicans to be winning more and more counties over time. So the claim that the GOP is winning more counties is possibly an interesting reflection on residential living patterns, but it doesn't really reflect what the voters wanted or what the government has a mandate to address." Our ruling Pence said that Trump "won more counties than any candidate on our side since Ronald Reagan." The electoral results leave little doubt that Trump expanded Republican success compared to Romney’s baseline in many corners of the country. However, it’s important not to overstate the importance of the statistic Pence cited. Clinton may have won fewer counties overall, but the ones she did win tended to be much more populous and economically dynamic. The statement is accurate, but it needs an asterisk, so we rate it Mostly True. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/ea7c6f37-927c-4edc-9de7-f78fd53257aa	None	Mike Pence	None	None	None	2016-12-04T17:54:39	2016-12-04	['Ronald_Reagan']

Kay Bailey Hutchison, speaking for Republicans in response to President Barack Obama’s weekly radio address on Saturday, spiced a call for keeping watch over the nation’s financial sector with a ‘plaint about Democrats’ stewardship of recently adopted health care legislation. "Americans are troubled," Hutchison said, "by the way Democrats forced their health care bill on the public that overwhelmingly opposed it." We missed the whips and chains in the health-care fight and wondered if Hutchison imagined things, considering key actions took place by majority votes. That said, we're setting aside this part of her statement as partisan hyperbole. For this article, we’re focusing on Hutchison’s claim that the American public "overwhelmingly opposed" the health care plan. PolitiFact.com previously looked at references to public opinion and the health care legislation. In February, it found Mostly True a statement by Sen. Jon Kyl, R-Arizona, that 75 percent of the American people "have said either don't do anything (on health care) or start over." And in March, PolitiFact.com rated as Half True Democratic U.S. Rep. John Yarmuth's statement that polling showed almost 40 percent of Americans opposed the health-care plan because they didn’t think it went far enough. Responding to our inquiry, Hutchison spokesman Jeff Sadosky told us that from late April 2009 to late April this year, telephone calls and letters mostly sent by Texans to the senior Texas senator ran heavily against "Obama’s health care" approach. More than 18,100 callers were opposed while 4,830 were in favor; about 75 percent of more than 350,000 letters that Hutchison received were against the reform, Sadosky said. Still, signals from Texas constituents don't necessarily demonstrate national sentiment. We turned next to polls taken before and after the final congressional action, which was followed in late March by Obama signing the plan into law. According to almost every poll we found, more Americans opposed action than favored it as the debate reached its climax. According to a Gallup poll taken March 4-7, weeks before the final votes, 48 percent of Americans said they would advise their representative to vote against an Obama health-care reform measure with 45 percent saying they’d advise a favorable vote. At the time, Gallup said the result confirmed "the generally divided nature of public opinion on health care legislation." Seeking to gauge whether Americans' opposition was overwhelming, as Hutchison puts it, we reviewed summaries of polls compiled by the non-partisan Kaiser Family Foundation, a reliable font of information on health care. From our sampling: A CNN/Opinion Research Corporation poll taken March 19-21 asked individuals if they generally favored or opposed the health care plan then awaiting final action. The tally: 39 percent in favor, 59 percent against and 2 percent with no opinion. A Bloomberg poll taken those same days found 38 percent of respondents in favor, 50 percent opposed and 12 percent not sure. Some other polls showed a narrower approval/disapproval gap. A Quinnipiac University poll taken March 22-23 found 40 percent mostly approving of the health care system changes just passed by Congress, 49 percent mostly disapproving and 11 percent not knowing or answering. In a CBS News poll taken March 18-23, 42 percent said they approved of the "current health care reform" measure, 46 percent were opposed and 12 percent said they did not know or declined to answer. And a poll taken March 23-26 by The Washington Post found 46 percent of respondents supporting the changes to the health care system just enacted by Congress and Obama with 46 percent opposed. A Gallup poll taken in early April showed a near-even break between Americans saying passage of the plan was a bad thing and Americans saying it was good. Forty-nine percent of individuals polled April 8-11 said it was a bad thing with 45 percent saying it was good. Generally, Gallup writes, "over the past year, Americans have been remarkably stable in their assessments of the bill, with neither supporters nor opponents able to generate sustained majority agreement with their position." Doubts remain high in Texas, according to an April 14 telephone poll by Rasmussen Reports. Sixty-seven percent of surveyed likely voters favor a proposal to repeal the health care plan to stop it from taking effect, with 28 percent opposing such a move. Where does all this leave Hutchison’s claim of overwhelming opposition at the time lawmakers acted? Certainly, many Texans clamored against approval. And national polls show more Americans opposed the action than supported it. But Hutchison overreaches by calling that opposition overwhelming. We rate Hutchison’s statement as Half True.

pomt-01576	Says U.S. House candidate Carlos Curbelo "supported ending the Medicare guarantee."	false	/florida/statements/2014/sep/09/joe-garcia/does-republican-carlos-curbelo-support-ending-medi/	U.S. Rep. Joe Garcia, D-Miami, portrays his Republican challenger Carlos Curbelo as out of touch with middle-class residents in his South Florida district when it comes to issues such as Medicare benefits. A Web ad repeatedly shows Curbelo in a TV interview saying "if anybody has a complaint, file it," while the ad lists a litany of attacks on Curbelo. (That quote is unrelated to Medicare and relates to a situation involving Curbelo’s work as a lobbyist.) Narrator: "When Curbelo supported ending the Medicare guarantee? Curbelo: "If anyone has a complaint, file it." Here we will fact-check whether Curbelo "supported ending the Medicare guarantee" -- an attack that could draw the attention of senior voters in the district that spans Miami to Key West. Paul Ryan’s proposals for Medicare The ad provides no explanation about what it would mean to end the Medicare guarantee or why Garcia claims that is Curbelo’s view. Curbelo is a Miami-Dade school board member who has never served in Congress so he hasn’t voted on any Medicare plan. Garcia’s attack relates to Curbelo’s statement in April 2014 about a GOP budget plan by U.S. Rep. Paul Ryan, R-Wis. Ryan, the House budget chairman, has included proposals to overhaul Medicare in his past few budget proposals with some changes along the way. When the Miami Herald asked Curbelo in April about whether he supported Ryan’s plan in response to a Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee attack, Curbelo said, "I would vote for any budget that helps create jobs and rewards hard work, protects Medicare for seniors, and stops immorally piling debt on my generation and on my daughters' generation. While I have not fully reviewed this budget I'm inclined to support it." So what did the DCCC mean about ending the Medicare "guarantee"? The clearest -- and least controversial -- explanation of how Medicare is a guarantee is that once you turn 65, you get Medicare, no questions asked. That’s been the case since Medicare was established in 1965. Medicare is structured as a defined-benefit plan rather than a defined-contribution plan. That means it specifies the benefits provided, rather than letting benefits depend on the amount of money paid into the system. But the federal government doesn’t guarantee that it will pay for every possible service or treatment -- Medigap insurance plans have emerged to pay for the procedures that Medicare doesn’t cover. And Congress and the president can change what is covered under Medicare. The Affordable Care Act makes changes to Medicare to reduce future growth of the program. Ryan has released multiple versions of his Medicare plan the past few years. The plan Ryan released this year advocates reforming Medicare into a "premium support" program in which, starting in 2024, every new beneficiary would go into the premium-support system, but they will be able to choose whether their premium-support payment goes to help pay for a private plan or a traditional fee-for-service plan. (Critics refer to this as a voucher plan, and it does have some similarities.) A spokesman for Ryan said the premium support payment would be pegged to the average bid. For those who were 55 or older in 2013, they would remain in the traditional Medicare system. Ryan also raises the eligibility from age 65 to 67. Ryan’s proposal to overhaul Medicare has not gone far because it lacks support in the Democratic-controlled Senate. The ‘guarantee’ of Medicare Simply saying that Ryan’s plan is "ending the Medicare guarantee" is a misleading overstatement. If we talk about the "Medicare guarantee" simply as seniors getting Medicare when they hit a certain age, they are still guaranteed to get it. "It is a fundamental change to Medicare, but saying that it ends the guarantee is too far, because everyone would still get some kind of insurance," said Massachusetts Institute of Technology economist Jonathan Gruber, who has advised Republican Mitt Romney and President Barack Obama on health care matters. Michael Tanner, a health care expert at the libertarian Cato Institute, said that under Ryan’s plan Medicare "is liable to be a smaller benefit, but it still is going to be a universal benefit. While it's going to be a smaller benefit, so is President Obama’s." Some Medicare experts we interviewed argued that it is unclear what types of services would remain guaranteed. "The Ryan plan keeps changing, lacks key details, and has multiple dimensions, making it hard to evaluate," said Jonathan Oberlander, a health policy professor at the University of North Carolina. Today, Medicare has a host of services that are covered including a number of days in the hospital or nursing home and covers specified tests and procedures. "These are ‘guaranteed.’ What would be covered under an insurance plan that people might buy with a voucher is not specified in law," said Henry J. Aaron, a senior fellow at Brookings Institute. "Benefits could erode over time if the voucher was not increased as fast as medical costs rise, a standard feature of many voucher plans, unless people ponied up additional premium payments that might rise rapidly if they want to maintain breadth of coverage." At this point, Ryan’s plan leaves advocates with questions. "I don’t know for certain if there would be guaranteed core benefits or if the benefits that are guaranteed now would have to be in those plans," said Judith Stein, executive director of the Center for Medicare Advocacy. "It would be substantially different." What Curbelo says Curbelo told PolitiFact Florida that he is against a voucher or premium-support plan for Medicare. "I’ve never supported the voucher concept," Curbelo said. "I don’t think we need to do that. I think we can preserve Medicare as it exists today through other reforms." Curbelo calls for "eliminating the rampant fraud in fee-for-service, adjusting the eligibility age to account for longer lifespan, and potentially, means testing," his campaign spokesman Wadi Gaitan told PolitiFact Florida. Curbelo, however, doesn’t deny that he said he supported Ryan’s overall budget proposal, though he told PolitiFact Florida he disagrees with the premium-support plan within it. "Given a choice between the GOP budget and the Democrats’ budget, he would have supported the GOP budget," Gaitan said. Accusing a Republican of wanting to get rid of the "Medicare guarantee" is a common Democratic tactic this year -- in fact, Garcia’s attack on Curbelo is similar to one in April by the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee. (The DCCC has used a similar attack on U.S. Rep Steve Southerland, R-Fla., and the Senate Democratic Campaign Committee has used it against GOP Senate candidate Joni Ernst in Iowa.) This Democratic talking point is the latest variation on the Democratic line that "Republicans voted to end Medicare," which PolitiFact rated Lie of the Year in 2011. Our ruling Garcia said "Curbelo supported ending the Medicare guarantee." The Democrats are hanging this claim on a very weak thread: when asked about Ryan’s budget proposal which includes a Medicare overhaul Curbelo said, "While I have not fully reviewed this budget I'm inclined to support it." That statement sheds no light on Curbelo’s views on changing Medicare. Ryan’s plan would change Medicare but it wouldn’t end the guarantee that seniors get it when they hit a certain age. And Curbelo says he wants to reform Medicare in other ways that don’t involve Ryan’s premium-support plan. We rate this claim False.

pomt-12076	Says Aaron Rodgers "is not the highest tax rate payer" in Wisconsin, it's "the single mom getting 24 grand in benefits with two kids who will lose 80 cents on the dollar if she goes and takes a job."	mostly false	/wisconsin/statements/2017/sep/01/paul-ryan/paul-ryan-says-single-mom-who-takes-job-not-packer/	A Dominican nun took the microphone at a CNN town hall in Racine, Wis. with U.S. House Speaker Paul Ryan, noted that they are both Catholics, and said to him: I’d like to ask you how you see yourself upholding the church’s social teaching that has the idea that God is always on the side of the poor and dispossessed. The Janesville Republican responded, in part, by referring to the Green Bay Packers’ star quarterback -- and arguing that welfare programs need to be reformed so that they don’t discourage work. Alluding to high tax rates he had criticized earlier in the Aug. 21, 2017 forum, Ryan said: I was telling you about these successful small businesses in Wisconsin -- they’ve got a 44.6 percent tax rate. That’s not the highest tax rate payer. I mean, Aaron Rodgers -- who deserves every salary -- is not the highest tax rate payer in this state. You know who it is? It’s the single mom getting 24 grand in benefits with two kids who would lose 80 cents on the dollar if she goes and takes a job. We have to fix that. Ryan essentially repeated the claim three days later while visiting Boeing in Washington State, comparing the aerospace giant and its corporate tax rate to the same single mother. He has also made nearly the same claim in the past, including at least twice in 2016. An unemployed single parent on public assistance who takes a job doesn’t suddenly start paying an income tax rate of 80 percent. And though Ryan has a point, the example he gives is rare, not common. Tax rates For 2017, Rodgers’ contract with the Packers pays him a base salary of $12.55 million. That alone puts him in the income brackets with the highest tax rates: 7.65 percent for Wisconsin, which applies to taxable incomes over $244,750 39.6 percent for federal, for taxable incomes of $418,401 and over That means Rodgers’ marginal rate -- the amount paid on the last dollar of income -- is a total rate of 47.25 percent. (The state rate plus the federal one.) So, what happens to the unemployed single mother, in Ryan’s scenario, who takes a job? Marginal tax rates Ryan spokesman Ian Martorana told us Ryan’s reference was not to the income tax rate paid by the single mother, but rather her effective marginal tax rate -- which takes into account public benefits that are lost as a result of an increase in income. Think of losing benefits as a result of taking a job as a tax. Ryan argues that by taking a job, the woman in his example would lose 80 cents in benefits for every $1 in income earned from taking a job. That would be a marginal tax rate of 80 percent. Experts told us that wouldn’t be the highest marginal tax rate anyone pays, but it would be among the highest. The problem is, Ryan’s statement suggests the 80 percent rate is relatively common. Experts told us it’s possible, but very rare, that a single unemployed parent could collect $24,000 a year in public benefits. She likely would need to receive relatively uncommon housing assistance in addition to food stamps, Medicaid and other benefits. The experts also said such a person would be hit with what amounts to an 80 percent tax rate only if she takes a job within a narrow income range above the poverty level -- not, for example, if the job pays minimum wage. A 2015 research paper Ryan’s office cited to us from the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office does not provide marginal tax rates for a single parent like the one Ryan described. However, for a single parent with one child -- and only within a narrow income range -- the marginal tax rate for 2016 averaged 75 percent Another source cited by Ryan, 2015 testimony to Congress from the nonprofit Urban Institute, also said marginal tax rates can reach 75 percent. But that occurs among relatively few people -- poverty-level workers who not only receive benefits such as food stamps and health insurance, but much less common housing assistance, and then begin earning higher incomes within a narrow range above the poverty level. In contrast, an unemployed person who takes a job would almost never face an 80 percent marginal tax rate, experts told us. That’s because while a newly employed person might lose some benefits by becoming employed, she would gain benefits from earned income and child care tax credits that come with taking a job. Other data For example, in a 2014 paper, the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a left-leaning think tank, argued that a single mother of two is better off by taking a job, even if it pays only $12,000 per year. She would lose some food stamps and have to pay income taxes. But by gaining the earned income and child tax credits, "that $12,000 job leads to a $16,630 increase in income," according to the paper. Only in narrow circumstances -- with an income of less than $29,000 and receiving "an unusual combination of government benefits" -- would the marginal tax rate for a single mother of two exceed 80 percent, according to a 2016 paper by the center. "In the overwhelming majority of cases, in fact, adults in poverty are significantly better off if they get a job, work more hours, or receive a wage hike," that paper said. At the same time, even if marginal tax rates don’t reach 80 percent for most lower-income people, they are perceived as a problem. The paper from the nonpartisan CBO says "when marginal tax rates are high, people tend to respond to the smaller financial gain from employment by working fewer hours, altering the intensity of their work, or not working at all." And Wisconsin Taxpayers Alliance president Todd Berry told us: "It is a real problem for anyone moving up the income scale from poverty, because so many of these programs are income-conditioned. The main point to be made here is how these programs are designed can create powerful disincentives" to work. Our rating Ryan says Aaron Rodgers "is not the highest tax rate payer" in Wisconsin, it's "the single mom getting 24 grand in benefits with two kids who will lose 80 cents on the dollar if she goes and takes a job." There’s some mixing of apples and oranges here. The reference to Rodgers is for the actual highest rate he would pay for income taxes. With regard to the single mother, Ryan is referring to her marginal tax rate -- how much in public benefits she would lose by taking a job. Ryan is correct that it’s possible for the woman he describes to lose 80 cents in benefits for every $1 in income earned -- an 80 percent marginal tax rate. But that occurs in very rare cases where the mother would be receiving a higher than typical set of public benefits and would take a job within a narrow income range above the poverty level. The vast majority of lower income people aren’t hit with a marginal tax rate as high as 80 percent, although even lower rates are considered strong disincentives to work. And advocates for the poor say the unemployed generally are better off financially by taking a job, even if they lose some public assistance. For a statement that contains some element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression, our rating is Mostly False. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com A footnote Ryan had been under criticism for not holding town halls in his southern Wisconsin district that were open to the public. We rated as Mostly True a claim from Randy Bryce, a Democrat who is running for Ryan’s seat in 2018, that Ryan had not done a public town hall in the district for more than 600 days. Ryan had turned to telephone town halls and events held in workplaces, which had limited public access. The CNN event was something of a hybrid: members of the public could apply to CNN to attend, but it was not like a traditional town hall held in a public building that anyone could enter. In Racine, Ryan drew headlines for criticizing remarks made by President Donald Trump about racial violence nine days earlier in Charlottesville, Va. But a portion of the CNN town hall was spent discussing taxes.

pomt-14505	"In Ohio, more than half the providers of safe and legal abortion have had to shut down" since Gov. John Kasich took office in 2011.	half-true	/ohio/statements/2016/feb/22/cecile-richards/planned-parenthoods-ceo-says-half-ohios-abortion-c/	Cecile Richards, the president of Planned Parenthood, told a crowd of women in Los Angeles how she really feels about the idea of Gov. John Kasich, R-Ohio, winning the presidential election: "It would be a complete and utter disaster." She continued, "Gov. Kasich has come off as a moderate, only by comparison to Ted Cruz and Donald Trump, but it’s really important to know in Ohio, more than half the providers of safe and legal abortion have had to shut down. He signed 17 separate bills to restrict reproductive access in the state." We looked more closely to find out how many of Ohio’s abortion providers had closed, and whether it could be attributed to Kasich’s leadership. Ohio’s chapter of NARAL Pro-Choice America has been keeping tabs on clinic closings and openings. They say that since 2011, Kasich’s first year in office, eight of the 16 surgical abortion clinics have closed or stopped performing abortions. A new provider in Akron opened in the summer of 2015, bringing the total number of functioning surgical abortion clinics in the state to nine. PolitiFact Ohio confirmed NARAL’s tally of closings in Ohio, in chronological order: February 2011, the Mahoning Valley Women’s Center, Youngstown June 2012, Capital Care Network, Columbus April 2013, Capital Care Network, Akron October 2013, Center for Choice, Toledo October 2013, Cleveland Center for Women’s Health June 2014, Cleveland Surgi-Center August 2014, Complete Healthcare for Women, Columbus August 2014, Women’s Medical Center of Cincinnati They key legislation that caused at least four of the clinics to close was passed in Ohio’s 2013 budget (HB 59). Kasich signed into law regulations that equate to a Catch-22 for abortion providers. HB 59 requires all ambulatory surgical facilities to have a transfer agreement with a local hospital to admit patients in case of emergency. At the same time, the law prohibits public hospitals from entering into transfer agreements with abortion providers. H.B. 59, 130th Gen. Assemb., Reg. Sess. (Ohio 2013) In 2013, the New York Times wrote about Ohio’s changing climate for women’s reproductive rights. "Ohio has become a laboratory for what anti-abortion leaders call the incremental strategy — passing a web of rules designed to push the hazy boundaries of Supreme Court guidelines without flagrantly violating them." Michael Gonidakis, president of Ohio Right to Life, put it more succinctly last year, when the Columbus Dispatch quoted him as saying, "The goal is to end abortion." The transfer agreement legislation shut down Toledo’s Center for Choice; the center was unable to get a transfer agreement from a private hospital after legislation outlawed their agreement with the public University of Toledo Medical Center. Today, their phone number forwards calls to a clinic in Michigan, the next-closest location for women seeking surgical abortions in the area. Likewise, the Women’s Medical Center of Cincinnati was denied an exception to their transfer agreement from the Ohio Health Department and went to court to fight the decision in Hamilton County. The center lost in court and closed in August 2014. A representative at Cleveland’s Surgi-Center told PolitiFact that when their location’s lease was up in July 2014, they had to move, which meant applying for a new ambulatory surgical center license through the Ohio Department of Health. "Knowing all the problems other clinics were having," the Surgi-Center stopped performing abortions. They still provide reproductive health services like STD screening and birth control. The Cleveland Center for Women’s Health closed in 2013 and relocated to Detroit, Mich., where there are fewer regulations for clinics that do abortions. The other four shuttered abortion providers closed for reasons that are not as directly tied to state regulations. The Mahoning Valley center in Youngstown closed as a business decision, according to NARAL. The Capital Care Network location in Akron closed after state inspectors identified safety violations that temporarily halted services, and the provider opted to close rather than correct the issues. In Columbus, Capital Care merged with Founders’ Women’s Health, another abortion provider. Finally, according to NARAL, the doctors with Complete Healthcare for Women, who still provide complete women’s health care services other than surgical abortions, never gave an explanation for why they stopped performing the procedures after 2014. Our ruling Richards said that "more than half the providers of safe and legal abortion have had to shut down." PolitiFact confirmed that since 2011, seven abortion providers have closed and an eighth stopped performing surgical abortions. That’s half of the previous 16 providers in the state -- not more than half. Also, four of the eight providers closed for reasons associated with provisions in HB 59, which Kasich signed. But that law hasn’t been directly tied to the other four abortion providers’ decisions to shut down. We rate Richards’ statement Half True.

pomt-02306	Says President Barack Obama's acceptance of an "Islamic order and gold medal" was "unconstitutional."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2014/apr/01/facebook-posts/meme-says-barack-obamas-acceptance-islamic-order-a/	In the run-up to President Barack Obama’s recent visit to Saudi Arabia, a reader sent us a Facebook meme that addressed a previous Obama visit to the kingdom. The meme features a pair of photographs of Obama, in what appears to be a Saudi palace, receiving an elaborate medal and necklace over his head. The text says, "Unconstitutional!!! Accepting an Islamic order and gold medal, 2/2011." The text of the meme goes on to quote the U.S. Constitution, Article I, Section 9: "No Title of Nobility shall be granted by the United States: And no Person holding any Office of Profit or Trust under them, shall, without the Consent of the Congress, accept of any present, Emolument, Office, or Title, of any kind whatever, from any King, Prince, or foreign State." We wondered whether Obama had received an honor from the Saudis, and if so, whether his acceptance of an "Islamic order and gold medal" was "unconstitutional." After a bit of digging, we discovered that the meme was referring to something that happened in June 2009 -- not February 2011, as the meme had said. It involved the awarding of the King Abdul Aziz Order of Merit, which is considered Saudi Arabia’s highest honor. It’s named for the first monarch of Saudi Arabia, also known as Ibn Saud. (The Saudi Embassy didn’t return an inquiry for this article.) We should also note here that, even though the meme has a distinct anti-Obama tone, President George W. Bush also received the same award in January 2008. After the award was placed around Bush's neck, the Associated Press reported, the president and King Abdullah "exchanged the region's traditional double kiss. ‘I am honored,’ Bush said." So, partisans beware: Whatever truth we find for Obama, the same will go for Bush. What does the Constitution say? A look at the Constitution confirms that the meme correctly relays the passage, known as the "emoluments clause." The framers included the clause because it signaled an end to hereditary leadership. Not only would the United States avoid granting titles of nobility itself, it would also prevent its leaders from accepting them from other countries. Under the emoluments clause, the president clearly qualifies as a "person holding any Office of Profit or Trust." And in this case he certainly received something "from any King, Prince, or foreign State." So the key question is this: Does the King Abdul Aziz Order of Merit qualify under one or more of the following categories. Is it a present? An emolument? An office? A title? We can quickly rule out "office." But the medallion is certainly a "present." Whether it’s an emolument (that is, a "gain from employment or position") or a title is a bit more up for grabs. Was it a "present"? Gifts -- tangible objects of more than trivial value -- are exchanged often in diplomacy, and there’s a well-established system for handling them. The portion of U.S. law known as 5 USC § 7342 ("Receipt and disposition of foreign gifts and decorations") sets out the conditions under which foreign gifts can be accepted. Essentially, a gift from a foreign country or foreign leader can be accepted on behalf of the United States, as long as it is handed over to an appropriate arm of the federal government, typically the General Services Administration or the National Archives. Often, these gifts find their way to presidential libraries, where the public can view them. The point is that they are property of the government, not the individual recipient. By passing this statute, Congress has essentially offered blanket consent for such acquisitions, without having to consider each one in a separate act. In the Jan. 18, 2011, edition of the Federal Register, the Obama administration officially disclosed the gift (a "large gold medallion with the Royal seal in a green leather display box" from "Abdullah bin Abd al-Aziz Al Saud, Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques, King of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia") and confirmed its disposition to the National Archives. So the medallion as a "present" appears to pose no constitutional problems. Was it an "emolument" or a "title"? The answer to this question is murkier. On the one hand, J. Peter Pham, director of the Atlantic Council’s Africa Center, said the King Abdul Aziz Order of Merit "is more than a mere medal. It confers an order, as indicated by its name, even if most people don’t take such things as seriously anymore." When King Saud created the order in the 1950s, Pham said, it was "modeled after the various orders of chivalry awarded by European royal houses," such as the United Kingdom’s Most Honorable Order of the Bath and Spain’s Order of Isabella the Catholic. Pham said these orders, both Saudi and European, "are differentiated from medals awarded for military service or civilian achievement. The latter are properly decorations, while the former confer membership, or honorary membership, in a class of individuals which, in former days, would have been referred to as having raised the recipient to the nobility if he or she did not already belong to it." In a 2009 Washington Post op-ed, Pham and Chapman University law professor Ronald Rotunda argued that "Washington, Madison and Hamilton would have clearly understood that the Abdul Aziz Order falls under the same ban they had in mind for any public officials coveting awards made under the honors system of the British monarchy." Other experts, however, say the King Abdul Aziz Order of Merit is more accurately considered an award for civilian achievement, not a grant of nobility. "All countries have decorations or honors they bestow on both their own citizens and foreigners, usually in recognition of some deed or act, or in the case of foreigners, simply an expression of gratitude for their contribution to the good relations between the two countries," said Edward W. Gnehm Jr., a professor at the Elliott School of International Affairs at George Washington University. "Many ambassadors receive similar medals or honors when they are leaving a post. They are certainly not a title, office or emolument." The ultimate argument against the order conferring a title stems from the specifics of how the Saudi royal family operates. "It is not a title of nobility, that is for sure," said F. Gregory Gause III, a Middle East specialist at the University of Vermont. "There is only one way into the ‘nobility’ in Saudi Arabia, and that is to be a member of the Al Saud family." The award, he said, is one "symbolizing achievement." Even Pham, who believes it’s fairer to say that acceptance into the order amounts to a title, agrees that the Facebook meme doesn’t describe the situation entirely accurately. Notably, he said, the meme is wrong to say that it’s an "Islamic order." "It is in fact open to non-Muslims, whereas the Saudi Collar of al-Badr is limited to Muslims," Pham said. Our ruling The meme says Obama's acceptance of an "Islamic order and gold medal" was "unconstitutional." Experts agree that Obama’s acceptance of the medallion and collar -- and their transferral to the National Archives -- is entirely constitutional, since the administration followed the longstanding rules on gifts set up by congressional statute. Experts are more divided, however, on whether acceptance of the medallion amounts to acceptance of a foreign title. Meanwhile, the meme errs in calling it an "Islamic order." On balance, we rate the claim Mostly False.	None	Facebook posts	None	None	None	2014-04-01T15:58:30	2014-03-27	['Islam', 'Barack_Obama']

pomt-04462	"We need a Senator who shows up to work. Sherrod Brown missed over 350 official votes."	mostly false	/ohio/statements/2012/oct/10/josh-mandel/josh-mandel-dings-sherrod-brown-missing-350-votes-/	For months, Democrats have accused Ohio Treasurer Josh Mandel of neglecting his official responsibilities because he failed to attend the first fourteen state Board of Deposit meetings that occurred during his term. Mandel denies that he ducked his duties and says his office sent a representative to each meeting. PolitiFact Ohio rated a claim about his missing work because he was traveling, raising campaign money as Half True. Now Mandel, the GOP candidate for U.S. Senate against Democratic incumbent Sherrod Brown, is airing a statewide television ad that says Brown is ignoring his official duties. The ad claims that Brown and other politicians in Washington "think they can live by a different set of rules," and dings Brown for missing more than 350 votes in Congress. "With 400,000 unemployed, we need a Senator who shows up to work," says the ad’s announcer, as the TV screen shows an empty chair. "Sherrod Brown missed over 350 official votes. When he finally showed up, voted to raise his own pay six times. Sherrod Brown, living by different rules than us." PolitiFact decided to look at the ad’s suggestion that Brown has not shown up for work and its claim that he missed over 350 official votes. A new release that announced the ad’s launch said Mandel’s campaign obtained its statistics from the GovTrack website. The news release also mentioned a fact missing from the ad that puts the missed votes in better perspective - they occurred over a period of more than 19 years, starting when Brown entered the U.S. House of Representatives in January 1993. A visit to the GovTrack website indicates there have been more than 10,000 recorded votes in that period. The largest number of Brown’s missed votes - 83 - occurred in 2000. He missed 13.7 percent of that year’s votes after suffering broken ribs and vertebrae in a car accident in Knox County. Brown spent more than a week in Mansfield MedCentral Hospital after the Jan. 30 crash, and missed occasional votes throughout the year because of follow-up medical treatments. For months after the crash, Brown wore an odd-looking plastic back brace around the U.S. Capitol. Then-President Clinton told Brown the brace made him resemble "a Roman soldier in a 1960s movie." Brown’s second highest year for missed votes was 2006, the year of his successful U.S. Senate race against incumbent GOP Sen. Mike DeWine. He missed 51 votes that year. Thirty-four of them were in its third quarter, the height of campaign season. Since he joined the U.S. Senate in 2007, GovTrack indicates that Brown has missed 21 out of 1779 votes - a 98.8 percent attendance record. This year, he hasn’t missed any votes. In 2011, he missed three. In 2010, he didn’t miss any. When asked why Mandel’s ad didn’t provide the context that Brown’s missed votes occurred over nearly two decades, Mandel spokesman Travis Considine said its claims are "factual," and observed that Brown’s missed vote rate was higher than the congressional median. The GovTrak website says the median rate of missed votes for all members of Congress is 2.5 percent, while Brown’s rate is 3 percent. "Why is it OK for Democrats to criticize Treasurer Mandel on meeting attendance but it’s not OK to question why Senator Brown missed more than 350 votes?" Considine asked in an email. "Are you employing a "different set of rules" for Brown and Mandel? " Brown’s campaign responded to the ad with a news release that claimed Mandel is "desperately trying to distract from his own appalling attendance record" by attacking Brown. It said Brown’s voting record would have been better if not for the car crash, and the fact that he had to care for his dying mother in 2009, a year when records show that Brown missed eight votes. There is an element of truth in Mandel’s claim: The ad correctly says that Brown has missed over 350 official votes. But it omits critical facts that would convey a different impression. It doesn’t mention those missed votes were spread over more than 19 years that includes Brown’s time in the U.S. House of Representatives and during that time more than 10,000 votes occurred. Brown’s voting attendance record throughout his congressional career - including time missed because of car crash injuries - is actually 96.5 percent. As a U.S. Senator, his attendance record is nearly 99 percent. Knowing those facts, and that Brown missed 351 out of 10,074 votes since January of 1993, would give a listener a different impression. On the Truth-O-Meter, the claim in the Mandel campaign ad rates Mostly False.	None	Josh Mandel	None	None	None	2012-10-10T06:00:00	2012-09-13	['None']
pomt-07361	"Prices are going up. Unemployment is continuing to go up."	half-true	/texas/statements/2011/may/06/ron-paul/us-rep-ron-paul-says-prices-are-increasing-and-une/	U.S. Rep. Ron Paul is courting the belly vote. During the first 2012 presidential debate in South Carolina on Thursday, the Texas Republican said the economy will cause President Barack Obama’s re-election efforts to suffer. "My theory is that people vote from their bellies because it’s whether they’re hungry or not or have jobs and need things, that’s why people vote," Paul said. "And we’re in big trouble. Prices are going up, unemployment is continuing to go up." We decided to check whether both prices and unemployment are rising. Let’s start with the former. Cheryl Abbot, an economist at the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, told us that prices are almost always going up because of inflation — the question is whether prices have been increasing at a faster rate as of late. And the answer is yes. According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics’ Consumer Price Index, year-over-year inflation rate has been accelerating since November 2010, when the rate was 1.1 percent. The bureau’s most recent data is from March, when the inflation rate was 2.7 percent. The price spike is "almost entirely due to gasoline prices," Abbot said. Take gasoline prices out of the picture, and the rate change is nominal, she said. What about unemployment? Flash back to January 2008, when the unemployment rate stood at a mere 5 percent. By October 2009, it was 10.1 percent. During most of 2010, unemployment hovered just below 10 percent, peaking in November at 9.8 percent. But since then, the rate has fallen every month, dropping to 8.8 percent in March. Until today, that is, when the the bureau reported that unemployment ticked up two-tenths of a point, to 9 percent, in April. That’s still high by historical standards, Abbot said, but she quibbles with Paul’s claim that unemployment "continues to go up." So do we. We have no qualms with Paul’s price claim, but unemployment has dropped steadily for four of the last five months. And the labor bureau didn’t report April’s uptick until after Paul made his debate talking point. We rate the statement Half True.	None	Ron Paul	None	None	None	2011-05-06T17:03:43	2011-05-05	['None']

pomt-05651	"This bill allows Virginia to join about 23 other states that have an ultrasound procedure" before an abortion.	mostly true	/virginia/statements/2012/mar/21/bob-mcdonnell/mcdonnell-says-23-states-have-ultrasound-requireme/	During a rapid-fire exchange on Meet the Press earlier this month, Gov. Bob McDonnell rejected host David Gregory’s contention that the legislation puts Virginia in a socially conservative corner. "This bill allows Virginia to join about 23 other states that have an ultrasound procedure," said McDonnell, a Republican. "It’s actually only about seven that have these kind of procedures," Gregory interrupted. "No, but there’s 23 that require a woman to have an opportunity to see an ultrasound," McDonnell replied. We wondered if the governor’s number is correct. Debate over Virginia’s law this winter became a national story when it became clear that the measure would require use of an invasive, transvaginal ultrasound -- even against a woman’s will. At McDonnell’s urging, the Republican-led General Assembly eventually passed a toned-down measure mandating that women, at least 24 hours before an abortion, undergo a common abdominal ultrasound in which an imaging wand is rubbed across the stomach. The patient must be offered an opportunity to view the image and hear the fetal heartbeat. Victims of rape and incest are exempt from the law if the molestation or assault was reported to legal authorities. Taylor Thornley, a spokeswoman for McDonnell, said the governor got his statistics about other states from separate studies by two groups that seldom agree: The Guttmacher Institute, a research and advocacy organization that supports women’s access to birth control and abortions; and the National Right to Life Committee, which opposes abortion. Neither group’s research includes Virginia’s law, which will become effective July 1. The National Right to Life Committee lists 23 states that have an "ultrasound option" and gives a brief description of each law. Guttmacher lists 21 states with ultrasound laws, including seven that mandate the test be performed before an abortion. Unlike the National Right to Life Committee, Guttmacher does not count North Carolina and Oklahoma, where the mandatory ultrasound laws have been stayed pending court challenges. Guttmacher shows the wide range of laws: Five states require that ultrasounds are offered to the woman by the provider: Indiana, Missouri, North Dakota, South Dakota and Utah. Nine states require that if an ultrasound is conducted to prepare for the abortion, the provider must offer to show the woman the image: Arkansas, Georgia, Idaho, Michigan, Nebraska, Ohio, South Carolina, Utah and West Virginia. Six states require an ultrasound for each abortion and the provider must offer to show the woman the image: Alabama, Arizona, Florida, Kansas, Louisiana and Mississippi. One state, Texas, requires an ultrasound for each abortion and that the provider display and describe the image. North Carolina and Oklahoma would fit into that final category if not for the court challenges. In the meantime, those states and Wisconsin require that women be given information on how to access ultrasounds. (Utah requires both that the woman be offered an ultrasound and that if the procedure is performed to prepare for the abortion, the woman is offered an opportunity to view the image.) So the state requirements range from giving women information on accessing ultrasounds to requiring abortion providers to give ultrasounds and display and describe the image. Elizabeth Nash, state issues manager at the institute, said once Virginia’s law goes into effect in July, it will be listed as requiring an ultrasound before an abortion and that the provider must offer to show the woman the image. Our ruling McDonnell, in a carefully worded statement, said the bill he recently signed "allows Virginia to join about 23 other states that have an ultrasound procedure" before allowing abortions. It is technically correct that 23 states have passed legislation that at least requires women be offered information on how to get ultrasounds before abortions. But the governor, in implying Virginia has adopted a mainstream law on ultrasounds, omitted a contradicting fact: Virginia will join only nine states that have passed mandatory ultrasound bills. And the enforcement of the laws in two of those states has been delayed by legal challenges. While McDonnell is accurate in saying 23 states have laws that deal with ultrasounds, his claim creates a misleading impression by not acknowledging only nine states require the procedure. We rate his claim Mostly True.	None	Bob McDonnell	None	None	None	2012-03-21T06:00:00	2012-03-11	['None']
pomt-11701	Says the Texas General Land Office led by George P. Bush has repaired just two homes since Hurricane Harvey.	mostly true	/texas/statements/2017/dec/21/jerry-patterson/charge-george-p-bush-led-agency-has-repaired-two-h/	Jerry Patterson says the fellow Republican who succeeded him as Texas land commissioner, George P. Bush, fixed very few homes in the months since Hurricane Harvey slapped ashore in August 2017. Patterson, otherwise confirming his 2018 candidacy for land commissioner, a post he previously held for 12 years, said in a recent interview that the Bush-led General Land Office hadn’t accomplished much in the way of hurricane relief. On Dec. 8, 2017, Patterson said to Austin American-Statesman commentator Ken Herman: "I mean, who the hell’s in charge here? And now we have tens of thousands of Texans who are essentially homeless and the land office has repaired two--two homes. And we’ve got folks waking up that have been sleeping in tents and they got snow this morning. People are still sleeping in tents." Patterson’s comment seemed potent given that the GLO announced in September 2017 it was teaming with the Federal Emergency Management Agency to hasten post-Harvey recovery in part by helping eligible survivors begin to patch up their homes--though full rebuilds weren’t in the mix. Bush said at the time: "With the magnitude of the damage from Hurricane Harvey, there is no doubt this will require a long recovery. This agreement marks the beginning of a new model for simplifying and expediting the transition out of sheltering to short-term and long-term housing recovery efforts." We focused this fact-check on Patterson’s insistence the GLO had only repaired two homes. Homeless--and tents? But Patterson’s other pokes also got our attention. How many Texans remain homeless due to the hurricane is hard to pin, we recently found. But a University of Texas expert, Gordon Wells, has estimated, based on flood insurance claims and satellite imagery, that at the least, more than 1 million Texas homes sustained flood damage though he told us that count could exceed 1.7 million. After Patterson spoke, we queried government officials about survivors in tents. By phone, the GLO’s Pete Phillips said some Aransas County residents, resistant to options such as out-of-town hotels, were residing in tents. Similarly, Bob Howard of FEMA’s Harvey response team responded by email: "Every effort is made to ensure survivors are aware of available local, state and federal resources. Thus far, all tent-dwellers found by the field team have indicated they prefer to remain in their current status or are not eligible for federal disaster assistance." Now let’s turn to Patterson’s focus on homes repaired with government help since Harvey and related rains flooded much of Southeast Texas. Patterson points to federal program We asked Patterson the basis of his numerical claim; he told us by phone that he was referring to two homes repaired as of early December 2017 through the federal Direct Assistance for Limited Home Repair (DALHR) program. Patterson, who said he’d drawn his tally of two from state-enlisted contractors and others he declined to identify, urged us to seek insight from elected leaders in counties hit by Harvey. We heard back from elected officials in two counties. Galveston County’s county judge, Mark Henry, said by phone that flooding due to Harvey had flooded 22,000 to 24,000 local homes with water an inch to eight feet deep. Henry, who volunteered that he’s a longtime friend to Patterson, said his office daily fields calls from residents awaiting help. Calling delayed repairs "frustrating," Henry said: "As far as the why" repairs have been delayed, Henry said, "I don’t know and I don’t care. I want it to get done." By email, a GLO spokeswoman, Brittany Eck, specified that as of mid-December 2017, the agency along with FEMA had housed 56 Galveston County "applicant households and 446 are in the process of receiving a direct housing solution." Also by phone, Loyd Neal, Nueces County’s judge, expressed chagrin that no agency advanced dollars enabling the Coastal Bend Council of Governments to hire individuals to consider applicants for short-term housing help. By email, Eck countered that the GLO had guaranteed up to $200,000 in reimbursed administrative costs to the regional councils asked to help administer post-Harvey housing assistance. Eck said that after the Coastal Bend council declined to participate, GLO employees were carrying out the program in that region. Neal told us that nearly four months since Harvey’s arrival, FEMA-funded housing including trailers or manufactured homes had yet to be brought into Port Aransas, the island tourist town where, Neal elaborated, more than two-thirds of local hurricane-damaged condominiums had yet to reopen. "It’s an absolute disgrace," Neal said, "that the state of Texas and the federal government and whoever else is in charge of this have not responded. It’s the greatest bureaucratic buck-passing I’ve ever seen." By email, Eck said that per FEMA in December 2017, 52 Nueces County households were in need of direct housing assistance. Correct count, but… We confirmed Patterson’s count of two homes whose DALHR repair projects had been completed with Eck and Phillips, a land office administrator. But those officials said Patterson’s claim gave short shrift to everything Harvey-related that Bush and the land office have undertaken and, Phillips said, to FEMA’s supervisory governing role. "He is oversimplifying what is going on," Phillips said, and "cherry-picking" given that the federal government supports housing options including thousands of hotel rooms, two types of home repair and possibly temporary apartments or trailers or manufactured homes. At the state level too, Phillips elaborated, "we’re always at the mercy of FEMA. They control the triage process" including, Eck said, confidential lists of homeowners for GLO to contact about their possibly seeking partial repairs backed by federal aid. Patterson, commenting on Phillips’ general assessment of his claim, said by email that "to be clear, I made a statement, and it turned out to be 100% factually accurate. None of the ‘context’ or ‘cherry-picking’ BS need apply." DALHR in Texas In November 2017, Bush announced the completion of the first DALHR home-repair project in Dickinson, in Galveston County. A GLO press release said the project included electrical and plumbing repairs, wall insulation, sheet rock, siding repair and replacing kitchen and bathroom sinks and a bathtub. That release said DALHR "provides permanent repairs for homeowners with moderate damages who lack available housing resources." But not everybody qualifies, the release made clear, in that beneficiaries must have sustained a FEMA-verified loss of $17,000 or more after 18 inches of interior flooding or more--though Phillips told us the GLO later encouraged FEMA to drop the 18-inch requirement, a change that qualified an additional 2,600 homes for consideration. According to the release, interested homeowners had to clear another half dozen hurdles such as a lack of other applicable insurance coverage and that eligible damages wouldn't exceed $60,000 or half the pre-hurricane taxable assessed value of the home. Then again, Eck told us by email, the latter limit was subsequently relaxed to allow awards to pay for up to half of a home’s replacement value. The November release also said that funded repairs under DALHR "are limited to real property components such as heating, plumbing, ventilation and air conditioning, walls, floors and ceilings," leaving our structural or engineering needs or any items covered by other aid. Varied aid offerings Let’s walk through some more of what the GLO and FEMA described as the programs they’re steering to Harvey survivors. Notably, Phillips said, and FEMA’s Howard confirmed, the teaming of the state agency with FEMA to coordinate short-term housing aid marked the first time a state agency had been given that front-line role. Eck said Gov. Greg Abbott "tapped the GLO to help FEMA implement these programs three weeks after the storm, in part due to the enormity of the affected area. In all cases, the applicant must be approved for eligibility by FEMA and, if interested, agree to the terms of FEMA’s regulations. The GLO is processing eligible applicants for short-term housing programs as FEMA is making their information available to the agency," Eck wrote. By email, Eck wrote that individuals displaced by the hurricane and its aftermath were offered federally funded hotel stays by FEMA while they looked for longer-term housing. "This program is currently housing 15,027 individuals in 1,334 hotels," Eck said. "None of the programs provided by FEMA are designed to be a permanent home replacement or complete repair program," Eck added. "The programs are designed to be short-term (up to 18 months) stopgap solutions while individuals work on long-term solutions." Starting Nov. 18, 2017, Eck wrote, the agency through early December 2017 had contacted 664 households judged by FEMA to be potentially qualified for the program. She said those contacts led to 290 expressions of interest and 182 DALHR home inspections--with 67 homes pre-qualified for repairs and 13 work orders issued for builders to start. "To date, two homes have had the work completed," Eck wrote. By email. FEMA’s Howard wrote: "We believe it is two projects at this point." Phillips said by phone that his DALHR goal was to complete more than 100 home projects by 2018; he said 36 builders were standing by ready to do the "re-work" on homes. Meantme, Phillips said, over 670 Texas families had received direct housing help by landing a trailer or manufactured home. At our request, FEMA’s Howard emailed us that agency’s daily Harvey fact sheet from the date that Patterson made his claim stating that 638 Texas families by then had been provided a trailer or manufactured home. As of mid-December, Howard told us by email, 8,057 Harvey survivors in the state still showed a need for a trailer or manufactured home and, he said, 2,600 of them remained under review for DAHLR aid. Otherwise, Phillips said, the GLO helped make available 40 apartment units in Wharton and also found 120 units of "corporate housing" to be made available in Conroe, in both cases under FEMA-backed programs. Howard said that generally by Dec. 14, 2017, 894,606 Texas residents had registered for Harvey-tired FEMA assistance of one kind or another. Another Patterson-cited program Patterson further told us the GLO had failed to help Texans benefit from another FEMA offering, the Partial Repair and Essential Power for Sheltering (PREPS) program, which provides up to $20,000 enabling homeowners to shelter in their homes thanks to limited repairs and the restoration of power. Eck said by email that PREPS aid was being offered by FEMA separately in that beneficiaries need a local government to provide a 10 percent match for an award to be made. By phone, meantime, Phillips said GLO officials had judged PREPS to be of limited value because families getting awards end up practically camping at home. The DALHR program, Phillips said, gets families "close to being whole." Our ruling Patterson said that since Hurricane Harvey, the agency helmed by Bush has done just two home repairs. Patterson’s figure, confirmed by GLO, was accurate. However, this claim leaves out ample significant information such as FEMA’s overriding control of the complicated DALHR program, which isn't open to every homeowner and only funds partial repairs. Notably too, additional homes were poised to qualify for or get repairs through DALHR at the time that Patterson spoke. We rate this statement Mostly True.

pomt-10139	"Oil companies ...currently have 68-million acres that they're not using."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/oct/07/barack-obama/unused-acres-arent-necessarily-being-ignored/	In the second presidential debate on Oct. 7, 2008, Sen. Barack Obama listed energy independence as one of the nation's biggest priorities, and touched briefly on the controversial issue of whether to open up new areas to offshore drilling. "I believe in the need for increased oil production," Obama said. "We're going to have to explore new ways to get more oil, and that includes offshore drilling. It includes telling the oil companies, that currently have 68-million acres that they're not using, that either you use them or you lose them." Obama has been a consistent opponent to opening new areas to offshore drilling. But in early August, Obama softened that position when he said he was open to supporting the New Energy Reform Act of 2008, a bipartisan compromise bill that includes alternative energy incentives that Obama wants — such as $84-billion over 10 years on research and development of better batteries, fuels and energy-saving technologies and tax incentives for people who buy hybrid and alternative-fuel cars — but also would allow drilling for oil and natural gas as close as 50 miles from Florida’s west coast. As he did in the debate, Obama has often bolstered his case against moving too fast on drilling with the argument that before opening up new areas to drilling, oil companies should be required to drill the acreage they already have. Obama is echoing a June report from the Democratic staff of the House Natural Resources Committee, which cited the fiscal 2007 statistics from the Interior Department's Minerals Revenue Management that classified 67,055,715 acres of oil and gas leases as "non-producing." The line sounds good as a Democratic rebuttal to Republican demands that Democrats move to allow drilling in Alaska's protected Arctic National Wildlife Refuge and offshore areas that also are currently off limits to the oil and gas companies. A Democratic House bill would bar new oil and gas leases to leaseholders who have not met benchmarks to "ensure" oil and gas production within five years on the leases they already hold. But Obama's statement is misleading, inasmuch as it suggests that oil and gas companies have access to 68-million acres of oil and gas fields that they deliberately are not drilling. What Obama did not take into account is the long, complex process that companies must work through, both in federal red tape and in geologic exploration, before leased property becomes a producing oil or gas field. The government classifies that acreage as "non-producing" simply because the companies aren't taking oil and natural gas out of it now. David Curtiss, director of the American Association of Petroleum Geologists' Geoscience and Energy Office in Washington, D.C., says it's wrong to assume that "the only lease that is being actively worked is one that has a drill rig on it." The Interior Department issues leases for onshore territory for 10-year initial terms. The department issues offshore leases for five-, eight- or 10-year initial terms, depending on the depth of the water. Dave Smith, a spokesman for the department's Minerals Management Service, which handles offshore leases, says those initial terms are calculated according to how long the government thinks it will take oil and gas companies to find and start producing oil or gas. For both onshore and offshore leases, the companies have to comply with government permitting requirements as they undertake a lengthy scientific exploration process that culminates in test drilling to determine whether there is enough oil or natural gas in a particular spot to warrant full-scale drilling. All the while, the companies are paying rent to the federal government for acreage that is classified as "non-producing." It can take more than 10 years for a company to start producing oil or natural gas from a leased parcel, but as long as the company can demonstrate that it is making serious efforts to find some, the leases are extended. If the company cannot show that it's actively working the parcel, the lease is not renewed. Sometimes companies don't renew leases if their early work leads them to believe adequate reserves of oil or gas don't exist. Obama's statement suggests that "non-producing" acreage where drilling is permitted is land that oil companies are ignoring. That is simply not true. Years of exploration and federal permitting must be completed before leased land yields oil or gas. As a result, we find Obama's claim to be False.

pomt-04197	"The city of Atlanta has one of the highest lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender populations per capita, ranking third among major American cities."	half-true	/georgia/statements/2012/dec/07/alex-wan/claim-about-size-atlantas-gay-population-has-some-/	The ongoing national debate about same-sex marriage recently reached the court of opinion inside Atlanta City Hall. Alex Wan, an openly gay Atlanta city councilman serving his first term, introduced legislation during the City Council’s last meeting of 2012 declaring support for marriage equality. Wan’s nonbinding resolution contained several pieces of information to back up his argument. We thought one statement in particular would be interesting to fact-check. "The city of Atlanta has one of the highest lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender populations per capita, ranking third among major American cities," it read. Atlanta has long been perceived to have one of the largest LGBT populations in the South, if not the nation. An annual LGBT pride festival draws an estimated 200,000 people. Several intown neighborhoods have businesses that market heavily to the LGBT community. Mayoral candidates actively courted LGBT voters during the 2009 campaign. Wan’s resolution passed by an 11-2 vote. Wan’s resolution may have little sway across the street from City Hall among lawmakers who work in the state Capitol. In 2004, 76 percent of Georgia voters backed a constitutional amendment banning same-sex marriage. The councilman recognized that obstacle, but believes the tide is shifting nationally on the issue and wanted Atlanta to be on the forefront. Wan said he’s unaware of any other Georgia cities that have passed a similar resolution. "We should be one of the first voices to that dialogue because of the sheer number (of LGBT residents in the city)," Wan said in a telephone interview. Wan added that he has been with his partner for more than seven years and said it "seemed inconsistent to me" that they’ve made such a commitment but can’t have it legally recognized by the state. The issue is somewhat thorny inside City Hall. Atlanta Mayor Kasim Reed has been criticized by some LGBT activists for not fully supporting same-sex marriage. Reed, who as a state lawmaker successfully passed a hate crimes bill to protect gays and other groups, has said he respects the council’s vote on the resolution. Wan said he didn’t intend to pressure Reed by introducing the resolution and hopes the mayor will soon "reach the same conclusion" on same-sex marriage. Wan said he based the claim about Atlanta off information from the online library Wikipedia. The Wikipedia link used a chart that was published in 2006 in The Seattle Times. The chart read Atlanta ranked third, with 12.8 percent of its population as LGBT. The sources for the chart were the U.S. Census Bureau and the Williams Institute, which conducts research on sexual orientation, gender identity law and public policy. The U.S. Census Bureau tracked the number of same-sex couples (it does not attempt to determine sexual orientation) by county in 2010. Among counties with 50 or more same-sex couples, DeKalb County was first in Georgia and 10th nationwide with about 15 same-sex couples per 1,000. Fulton County was second in Georgia and ranked 21st in the U.S. with nearly 12 same-sex couples per 1,000. According to another website, City-Data, Atlanta ranked 32nd in the percentage of same-sex unmarried households. If you narrow it down to cities with overall populations greater than 100,000, Atlanta ranked sixth in the percentage of same-sex unmarried households. The list does not indicate when it was compiled, but the numbers were pretty similar to the most recent U.S. census data. PolitiFact Georgia reviewed 2011 U.S. census data, and it showed the percentage of same-sex unmarried households in Atlanta was 1.6 percent. Atlanta’s percentage was lower than San Francisco, Fort Lauderdale, Fla., Oakland, Calif., Seattle and Santa Fe, N.M. Of those cities, Seattle is the only one in a state that recognizes same-sex marriages, and their law was passed last month. To sum up, Councilman Wan said Atlanta has one of the highest lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender populations per capita and ranks third nationally. From what we can determine from U.S. census and other data, it’s valid to state Atlanta has one of the highest LGBT populations in the country. It’s less clear that Atlanta ranks third nationally because there’s not much current data detailing the percentage of all LGBT residents by city. Atlanta ranks below more than at least five cities when it comes to same-sex, unmarried households. The first part of Wan’s claim appears accurate. But even these numbers are open to interpretation. It appears Atlanta is a little lower than third in the other part of the claim. Overall, Wan’s statement is probably accurate, but it needs a lot of context. We rate it: Half True.

pomt-10168	Under Obama's tax plan, "95 percent of you will get a tax cut."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/sep/27/barack-obama/many-will-get-tax-cuts-but-not-that-many/	At the presidential debate in Oxford, Miss., Barack Obama described his tax plan and said, "Here's what I can tell the American people: 95 percent of you will get a tax cut." We checked a similar claim of Obama's recently, that 95 percent of working families would get lower taxes under Obama's plan, and found it to be True . But Obama stretched things when he said that 95 percent of "you" — everyone — would receive a tax cut. The part of Obama's tax plan that results in widespread tax cuts is a tax credit for workers, intended to offset payroll taxes. Single workers would get $500, and working couples would get $1,000. But not all taxpayers get paychecks from an employer, and those who don't would not get the credit. Additionally, Obama intends to raise taxes on higher brackets ($200,000 for singles and $250,000 for couples) which would offset any tax cuts for those incomes. A detailed analysis by the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center found that if you look at all tax filers, 81 percent of tax filers would see reduced taxes under the Obama plan. So Obama's statement at the debate glosses over a few important details about who would get tax cuts under his plan. If you're talking about everyone, it's 81 percent. If you're talking about working families, it's 95 percent. The difference between 81 percent and 95 percent is not insignificant. We rule his debate statement Half True.

pomt-13493	Says Donald Trump supports "an agenda out there" to privatize the Veterans Affairs health care system.	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/sep/07/hillary-clinton/hillary-clinton-says-donald-trump-supports-privati/	Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton pledged to do "whatever is required to move the VA into the 21st century" during NBC’s Commander-In-Chief Forum, while adding that her opponent’s plan would be much worse for veterans. "I will not let the VA be privatized," Clinton said Sept. 7, 2016, during the forum at the Intrepid Sea, Air & Space Museum in New York. "I do think there is an agenda out there, supported by my opponent, to do just that. I think that would be very disastrous for our military veterans." We wondered if Republican nominee Donald Trump has proposed or supports privatization of the health care system for U.S. veterans. Trump, for the record, addressed the question head on when it was his turn to answer questions. "I never said take the VA -- take the Veterans administration -- private." "I wouldn’t do that," Trump added. "I do believe, when you're waiting in line six, seven days, you should never be in a position like that. You go out, you see the (private) doctor, you get yourself taken care of." Trump's comments are consistent with what he's said before, and Clinton's concerns about privatization are a misleading Democratic talking point. In July, Democratic vice presidential nominee Tim Kaine said that "Donald Trump is a guy who has called for privatization" of the VA. What we found then, and what holds now, is that Trump wants to give veterans access to private providers when they face delays at the VA. That's not the same as privatization. When we contacted Clinton's campaign about her statement, spokesman Josh Schwerin sent us several references where Trump's plan has been characterized as some degree of privatization and Trump’s explicit promise to give veterans the chance to go elsewhere for care. "Every veteran will get timely access to top quality medical care. Every veteran," Trump pledged in a July 11, 2016, speech in Virginia Beach, Va. "Veterans should be guaranteed the right to choose their doctor and clinics, whether at a VA facility or at a private medical center. We must extend this right to all veterans, not just those who can’t get an appointment in 30 days or who live more than 40 miles from a VA hospital, which is, unfortunately, the current and wrong policy." The logistics of how that would work, of course, are another matter. Trump has spoken of letting VA patients go to any doctor or health care facility that accepts Medicare and getting treatment there immediately. The VA would pay for the bill. Experts we spoke with raised several issues with Trump’s plan and also debated whether Trump's plan should be considered a type of partial privatization. One concern is that non-VA providers don’t have the same level of experience that the VA has with treating veteran's health issues — including combat injuries, combat-related illnesses and mental health issues such as post-traumatic stress disorder. There's also concern that letting veterans go anywhere for their care would result in fragmented, uncoordinated, and lower-quality care. Our ruling Clinton said Donald Trump supports privatizing the Veterans Affairs health care system. Trump does support allowing more privatized care in cases where treatment at the VA is delayed or inadequate. In some cases he's talked about giving veterans a choice that would include doctors and hospitals outside the system. But that's not the same as privatizing the system, which would get the get the government out of the treatment business. Trump has never proposed that. Because Clinton's statement contains some element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression, we rate it Mostly False. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/9e782bf2-269d-45f2-9c69-c527093c99f2	None	Hillary Clinton	None	None	None	2016-09-07T22:32:00	2016-09-07	['None']

pomt-03446	Says the Obama administration plans to reduce the number of beds devoted to holding individuals violating immigration laws and to "release hundreds of dangerous criminals into our communities."	mostly false	/texas/statements/2013/jun/21/michael-mccaul/mccaul-said-obama-administration-plans-reduce-dete/	U.S. Rep. Michael McCaul of Texas warned of bad guys on the horizon while summarizing proposed appropriations for the Department of Homeland Security. In his June 5, 2013, floor remarks, the Austin Republican and chairman of the House Homeland Security Committee said the outlined spending would cover additional Border Patrol officers and continued operation of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, which enforces laws governing border control, customs, trade and immigration. Plus, McCaul said, the legislation had "funding for ICE’s 34,000 detention beds despite the administration’s plans to reduce the number and release hundreds of dangerous criminals into our communities." A flood of dangerous criminals? In this context, "beds" refers to ICE regularly placing non-U.S. citizens "who are apprehended and determined to need custodial supervision" in more than 250 facilities around the country, Congress has lately required the government to maintain at least 34,000 beds to house such apprehended individuals, though not all the beds are always filled. Administration urged reduction in detention beds McCaul spokesman Mike Rosen told us by email that Congress mandated 33,400 detention beds from 2009 through 2011 before raising the threshold to 34,000 starting in 2012. In contrast, Rosen said that President Barack Obama had proposed to fund 31,800 beds in fiscal 2014, which begins Oct. 1, 2013. Homeland Security’s 2014 budget request says the cut would save $114 million, adding: "This level of beds allows ICE to ensure the most cost-effective use of federal dollars, focusing the more-costly detention capabilities on priority and mandatory detainees, while placing low-risk, non-mandatory detainees in lower cost alternatives to detention programs." An April 12, 2013, Washington Times news article put the budget request this way: "The president said he wants to reduce the number of illegal immigrants ICE keeps in detention from 34,000 to 31,800." The story also said, "Congress fought hard during the past decade to boost the number of detentions, arguing that those who were allowed back into the general population rarely returned to be deported." The story quoted Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano as saying the department believes it can keep all high-priority individuals detained with the lower number of beds, while making use of alternatives to track the other people in deportation proceedings, the story said. So, the administration sought to fund fewer detention beds. Detainees have included few violent criminals And was the result going to be hundreds of dangerous criminals let loose? ICE officials did not respond to our inquiry about the percentage of violent criminals in detention nor did we come up with other current-day breakdowns. But according to a Feb. 11, 2010, outside analysis, when the number of detainees surged more than 60 percent to 385,524 from fiscal 2005 through fiscal 2009, few of them had criminal convictions. The study by the Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse at Syracuse University found that detainees "without any criminal conviction doubled between fiscal 2005 and (fiscal) 2009," the study said, when they accounted for 73 percent of detainees. However, the share of detainees with criminal convictions reached 43 percent in the first three months of fiscal 2010, the study said, as increases in overall detainees leveled out. Government released 2,200 detainees By email, Rosen said McCaul’s reference to dangerous criminals reflected on "detainee releases for budgetary reasons," including felons, in 2013 that McCaul tabulated based on information he obtained from ICE’s director, John Morton. During February 2013, the agency indeed released individuals who had past criminal convictions, according to news accounts and testimony, though few had felony convictions and most remained subject to immigration proceedings. Public knowledge of the releases appears to have been spurred by a news story. On March 1, 2013, the Associated Press reported that Homeland Security had recently released more than 2,000 illegal immigrants from its jails--in states including Arizona, California, Georgia and Texas--due to looming budget cuts. According to the report, the released individuals--granted supervised release under conditions that can include mandatory check-ins, home visits and GPS devices--would still be required to appear for immigration hearings. The story, citing ICE budget documents, said the agency had temporarily shuttered plans to release 3,000 additional detainees in reaction to intense criticism. The internal budget documents "show the Obama administration had intended to reduce" the average daily population of detainees from about 31,000 to 25,748 by the end of March 2013, the story said. Also, Rosen pointed us to an ICE document with those figures. About two weeks after the news story appeared, ICE’s Morton testified to the Homeland Security Subcommittee of the House Appropriations Committee that he had 2,228 detainees released over several weeks from Feb. 9 to March 1, 2013 "to other forms of supervision," according to a transcript. He said he acted for immediate budgetary reasons plus concern about the federal sequester that was set to trigger automatic cuts starting in March. Also in February 2013, Obama warned that if the sequester hit, "federal prosecutors will have to close cases and let criminals go." PolitiFact in Washington rated that claim Mostly False, concluding that while U.S. Attorney offices would face cuts under the sequester, officials would have discretion in prioritizing cases notably involving, by and large, individuals yet to be tried. Official: Dangerous criminals not among released Morton told the subcommittee that ICE’s releases did not include dangerous criminals. He said officials let out individuals "who were not subject to mandatory detention and they did not pose a significant threat to public safety" and, he said, each individual remained subject to deportation. Seventy percent "of those individuals released had no criminal record," Morton said. "The remaining 30 percent were either misdemeanants or other criminals whose prior conviction was not a serious violent crime." He closed his prepared statement by saying "there are no mass releases of dangerous criminals under way or any plan for the future, just efforts to live within our budget." Questioned by U.S. Rep. John Carter, R-Round Rock, the subcommittee chairman, Morton said the released individuals included 10 "Level 1" offenders, in this case meaning crimes like aggravated financial felonies, Morton said, and four of the 10 were subsequently returned to custody. The six not returned to custody were not violent criminals, he said. Morton said one "Level 1" offense occurred in 1979 and another involved the single father of a 5-month-old child. He said that in each of these releases, field officers made the decision "and I'm confident that if I were to share these offenses with you, you would be better reassured that we are not out willy-nilly releasing serious Level 1 offenders." Morton said the released individuals included 159 "Level 2" offenders, including "a fair number" of people whose "most serious offense will have been for a theft offense, for example petty larceny or shoplifting, traffic offenses. The largest category will be for" drunk driving, Morton said, including some multiple convictions. He said 460 "Level 3" offenders, convicted of misdemeanors, were released, saying their crimes would have ranged from a single traffic offense, a single drunk driving conviction or shoplifting. In May 2013, Nelson Peacock, an assistant secretary of homeland security, said 622 of the released detainees had some type of criminal conviction. In his May 6, 2013, letter to Sens. Carl Levin and John McCain, which McCain posted online, Peacock specified that there were 32 Level 1 and 80 Level 2 detainees released. He wrote, too, that 58 released detainees were re-detained. At the March subcommittee hearing, Carter noted that the agency’s "priorities for detention include illegal aliens who have not been convicted of crimes but otherwise pose a threat to national security or public safety." Morton replied that no such detainees were released. He also said he did not know how many of the released individuals had pending criminal charges. Carter: "How many were violent criminals?" Morton: "I am not aware of any violent criminals..." Also at the meeting, Rep. Henry Cuellar, D-Laredo, said that under federal law, the agency has had the authority to release detainees since at least 1952. Morton agreed, saying detentions are the exception to normal practices. "We have limited resources," Morton said. "Congress has directed a level of mandatory detention that focuses around mainly violent offenders and certain aliens; the vast majority of the people in the system Congress provides for consideration for release." Morton earlier said: "Just to give you some perspective of it, there are 350,000 people in immigration proceedings at any given time, only about 34,000 of whom -- actually, in Alaska, some of the Border Patrol cases aren't even in formal proceedings -- are in detention. The vast majority of people are not detained by design. Congress has provided for their release on bond or a supervision. Immigration judges make those calls." Next, we circled back to McCaul’s office per Morton's testimony. By email, Rosen said the "drastic reductions" in detention beds in Obama’s budget request "would inherently result in the release of dangerous criminals." Outside takes We also ran the congressman’s claim past David Burnham, co-director of the records clearinghouse, who said any reference to dangerous criminals being let go exaggerates the administration’s intent. "There’s some rhetoric here," Burnham said. Donald Kerwin, who directs the New York-based Center for Migration Studies, which describes itself as devoted to the study of migration, to the promotion of understanding between immigrants and receiving communities and to public policies that safeguard the dignity and rights of migrants and newcomers, pointed out by telephone that the administration has long said its focus is on deporting criminal immigrants and recent arrivals, which is what ICE says on an agency web page including a graph indicating that in the fiscal year through September 2012, 55 percent of immigrants removed from the country were convicted criminals. An Obama adviser, Cecilia Muñoz, touted the approach in a White House blog entry Aug. 18, 2011. Kerwin speculated that the only way the administration would release a seriously violent criminal from detention is "mistakenly." Our ruling McCaul said the Obama administration, seeking to reduce the number of detention beds, plans to "release hundreds of dangerous criminals into our communities." The administration has sought to shrink the number of beds devoted to holding individuals in detention, saying that would save money. If approved, this could lead to more individuals who face immigration proceedings not living behind bars. It also looks to us like the government is keeping its options open on releasing more immigration detainees if money runs tight. However, we did not confirm any related expected release of hundreds, or even a few, dangerous criminals. The February 2013 release of 2,200-plus individuals didn't include violent criminals, a top administrator testified. McCaul’s statement has an element of truth; the administration's budget request. But there doesn't appear to be any plan to release dangerous criminals. We rate the claim as Mostly False.	None	Michael McCaul	None	None	None	2013-06-21T10:31:04	2013-06-05	['Barack_Obama']
pomt-14974	"I did not play any role in bringing the company to RI as did others in government. I was tasked with handling the legislation affecting the company by my superiors."	false	/rhode-island/statements/2015/oct/18/steven-costantino/despite-his-protests-afar-costantino-played-key-ro/	Steven M. Costantino, a former House Finance Committee chairman, was more than a hundred miles away, working in Vermont’s state government, when newly disclosed public records and emails fueled a wave of recent headlines on the $75 million 38 Studios boondoggle. From the other side of the Green Mountains, he could feel the spotlight. The state’s financing of the upstart video-game company, to the tune of $75 million in loan guarantees, lured 38 Studios from Massachusetts to Providence in 2010, but left Rhode Island taxpayers vulnerable in the company’s 2012 bankruptcy. Amid the torrent of new headlines about 38 Studios, Costantino, who is now commissioner of the Department of Vermont Health Access, issued the following statement on Sept. 27: "My only involvement in the matter in RI was because of my former position in the RI legislature. I did not play any role in bringing the company to RI as did others in government. I was tasked with handling the legislation affecting the company by my superiors." Costantino acknowledges he was involved with the legislation, but denies "any role," compared with what "others in government" did, to "bring" Curt Schilling’s 38 Studios to Rhode Island. How can he have been both involved and not involved? Unfortunately, the former lawmaker did not respond to our request for an interview, leaving us to sort out this contradiction on our own. The freshly released emails and deposition transcripts hark back to early 2010 when Rhode Island’s courtship of 38 Studios began to get serious. The documents give the public a window into which state officials were driving the 38 Studios deal. Costantino comes across as a behind-the-scenes facilitator, helping to lay the groundwork for the public financing. The comments recorded in the depositions and other records show that Costantino: Developed the idea for guaranteeing 38 Studios’ loans. He was the first to advocate for 38 Studios’ receipt of a $75-million state guaranteed loan, according to Keith Stokes, chairman of the R.I Economic Development Corporation at the time. And J. Michael Saul, then the EDC’s finance director, recalls that Costantino proposed the expansion of an existing loan guarantee program during a visit to 38 Studios’ headquarters in Maynard, Mass. "And at the conclusion of the meeting," Saul testified, "he turned to me and asked me the question: If we were to increase the $50-million (loan program) to $125 million would this -- I’m paraphrasing here -- would this be helpful to get this done?" In another email, an EDC lawyer, Robert I. Stolzman advised Carcieri’s chief of staff Andrew Hodgkin that he had sent him several documents including a draft "authorizing the RIEDC to guarantee 38 Studios’ debt (at the suggestion of House Finance Chairman Costantino, the … draft reflects a larger authorization for this as a Jobs Creation Guaranty Program)." Costantino, in his deposition in 2014, did not to dispute anything in the Stolzman note. Was among just a few lawmakers in the loop. Only House Speaker Gordon Fox, Senate President M. Teresa Paiva-Weed, Sen. Daniel DaPonte, and Costantino knew about the 38 Studios transaction when the General Assembly approved the bill for the guarantees in 2010, according Marcel A. Valois, the EDC’s former director. Another email from Stolzman, the EDC’s lawyer, suggests that Sharon Reynolds, the House fiscal adviser, and Costantino were privy to certain background and "summary information" on the "38 Studios transaction" before Governor Carcieri. Shielded the 38 Studios transaction from public scrutiny. During a videotaped discussion of the bill on the House floor on April 13, one lawmaker asked about the origins of the loan guarantee legislation and who was behind it. "There's always conversations with lobbyists and small businesses," Costantino said. He didn’t name 38 Studios. Later on in June of 2010, Costantino told Stolzman he hadn’t told a Providence Journal reporter about his visit to 38 Studios. And Costantino said he wanted to know what EDC staffers were saying about the deal. Steered the legislation for 38 Studios’ guaranteed loan. In two separate April 2 emails with the numerals "38" noted in the subject line, Stokes mentions Costantino’s role in scheduling the legislation, advising others that "Steven Costantino wants to move on it next week" and that Costantino has advised him that House Speaker Fox wants to post the item for hearing. Our ruling In his defense, Costantino issued a statement in which he said: "I did not play any role in bringing the company to RI as did others in government. I was tasked with handling the legislation affecting the company by my superiors." In other words: Don’t blame me, I was just doing my job. But the records and comments of people involved illustrate that Costantino played a key part in Rhode Island's courtship of 38 Studios. The legislation he helped pass, offering valuable loan guarantees, was his idea, according to one former EDC official. During the process, Costantino shielded his idea from the type of full political scrutiny that might have killed it. He did this by not naming 38 Studios on the House floor when he was asked who was pushing for the loan-guarantee program. When the deal was done, the CEO of Schilling's company thanked all members of the General Assembly and singled out five elected officials by name, including the former House Finance Committee chairman. Costantino played a pivotal role in creating the 38 Studios mess. In some ways, the record shows he bears as much responsibility as the other elected government officials who "tasked" him. We rate his statement False. (If you have a claim you’d like PolitiFact Rhode Island to check, email us at politifact@providencejournal.com. And follow us on Twitter: @politifactri.)

pomt-09459	"President Obama's bill won't bring down the costs (of health care) for average Americans -- or really for very few Americans, if any."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/mar/04/michele-bachmann/bachmann-says-democratic-health-care-bill-wont-low/	Rep. Michele Bachmann, R-Minn., has a reputation for using political rhetoric that pushes the envelope. On March 3, 2010, she appeared on CNN's Larry King Live along with Democratic Rep. Alan Grayson, a Floridian who's also known for his outspokenness from the opposite ideological perspective. We thought we'd look into one of the comments she made about the issue of the day: the Democratic health care reform plan. "Unfortunately," she said, "President Obama's bill won't bring down the costs for average Americans -- or really for very few Americans, if any." To test this claim, we turned first to the nonpartisan referee for such questions -- the Congressional Budget Office. We looked at a CBO analysis of the Senate Democratic health care bill released Nov. 30, 2009. This bill -- which was passed by the Senate in December 2009 -- forms the basis for President Barack Obama's own proposal. (The CBO has not directly analyzed Obama's proposal, but most health policy analysts do not expect the numbers to change dramatically from what the CBO analyzed in November.) Before we dig into the CBO study, we should outline the three types of private coverage and how they differ. Individual policies are obtained directly by individuals or families, without an employer serving as an intermediary. "Small-group" plans are provided through small employers. And "large-group" policies are plans obtained through larger employers. The CBO looked at the effect of the health care bill on premiums for each category. One other thing to know: The bill provides subsidies for people in the individual and small-group markets whose income is below certain thresholds. The CBO looked at how the bill would change premiums both before subsidies were factored in and after. So here's what the CBO expects for 2016, the year its analysts chose as the benchmark. For individual plans -- before subsidies are taken into account -- the bill would make policies 10 percent to 13 percent more expensive. But a big reason for this increase is that the bill would set higher minimum standards for coverage. So, before subsidies are factored in, people and families buying individual policies would have to pay more, but they would also be getting more generous coverage. However, it's worth noting that many people on the individual market would qualify for subsidies. In fact, the CBO estimates that 57 percent of individual-market purchasers would. And once these subsidies are factored in, buyers on the individual market would see their premiums drop quite a bit -- between 56 percent and 59 percent, according to the CBO. (The question of whether to count or not to count subsidies when analyzing the bill became a major bone of contention during the Feb. 25, 2010, presidential health care summit; you can read a previous PolitiFact item for a more detailed explanation of this question, http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/feb/25/barack-obama/obama-says-under-democratic-health-plan-family-ins/) For the second category -- the small-group market -- the CBO estimates that unsubsidized premiums would land somewhere on the continuum between rising by 1 percent and falling by 2 percent. For the 12 percent of small-group beneficiaries who are expected to qualify for subsidies, premiums would fall by 8 to 11 percent. Finally, in the third category -- the large-group market -- the change in premiums would range from no change to a 3 percent decline. (Large-group beneficiaries are not eligible for subsidies under the bill.) To fuly analyze Bachmann's claim, we need to add in one additional factor: the number of Americans who will buy insurance in each of these three markets. The CBO estimates that 134 million people will be covered by large-group plans, 25 million will be covered by small-group plans and 32 million will be covered by individual market plans. The total of these three categories is 191 million people. (Remember that many Americans are covered by Medicare, Medicaid or other government plans, and these are not included in the CBO's analysis, or in ours.) Let's first analyze these numbers using the strictest definition -- unsubsidized premiums. And because the CBO is using a range of likely outcomes, we'll do our best to quantify how many people will actually see their premiums fall. We'll do this by assuming that, say, for a range of 10 percent to 13 percent, one quarter will see a change of 10 percent, one quarter will see a change of 11 percent, one quarter will see a change of 12 percent, and one quarter will see a change of 13 percent. The real numbers will not fit so neatly into that kind of breakdown, but health economists tell us it's a serviceable guide. By our reckoning, then, three quarters of the 134 million people in large-group plans -- 101 million -- will see their premiums fall slightly. Next, in the small group market, let's assume that half the beneficiaries will see a decline in premiums (those who see their premiums fall by 1 percent or 2 percent.) That translates to about 13 million people. So, right off the bat -- without factoring in subsidies -- the CBO expects 114 million people to see their premiums go down at least a little bit. That's about 60 percent of beneficiaries. Once subsidies are accounted for, the percentages rise. In the small-group market, 12 percent of beneficiaries would qualify for subsidies, the CBO projects. Proportionally, these subsidies would reduce premiums for an additional 1.5 million people. In the individual market, 57 percent would qualify for subsidies, according to CBO. That's about 18 million people who'd see their premiums drop. So, adding it up, nearly 134 million people should see their premiums go down when subsidies are factored in. That's about 70 percent of all privately insured Americans. What about the rest? By our calculations, about 45 million people would see their premiums stay the same. Adding them to the 134 million Americans who saw their premiums drop, you get 179 million people, or almost 94 percent of those on private insurance. That leaves about 14 million Americans who would see their premiums go up, according to the CBO's model. (The numbers don't add up to 191 million due to rounding.) These unlucky beneficiaries -- mostly people with individual insurance who earn too much to receive subsidies -- account for 7 percent of those with private insurance in 2016. Of course, the CBO's projections are only that -- projections. In addition, basic mathematics suggests that some number of Americans will see their premiums rise or fall by greater amounts than the CBO estimates. So our exercise should be taken with due caution. But the CBO is the generally accepted arbiter of these questions and the overall trend seems solid despite the caveats. However, looked at another way, Bachmann would have had a stronger point if she had said the bill's benefits are limited. Only about 21 million people -- those who receive subsidies -- will see their premiums drop by more than a few percentage points. That's about 11 percent of the people with private insurance in 2016 -- within shouting distance of the "very few Americans" she referenced in her quote. Measured in raw dollars, a decrease of 1 to 3 percent won't put a whole lot of additional money in the pockets of the other nine-tenths of the private market. By the CBO's estimate, the difference could be on the order of $100 or $200 on a several-thousand-dollar policy. But we're rating Bachmann's claim that "President Obama's bill won't bring down the costs (of health care) for average Americans -- or really for very few Americans, if any." And on that, our interpretation of the CBO numbers indicates she's wrong. Using the strict, unsubsidized figures, 60 percent of Americans in the private insurance market should see their premiums fall. And taking into account the subsidies, a full 70 percent would see their premiums fall. And almost 94 percent would see their premiums either fall or stay the same. No matter how you slice it, the overwhelming majority are likely to see a decline. So we find her claim False.

pomt-06417	"The largest category of people coming into the technical schools in Wisconsin are people with four-year degrees."	false	/wisconsin/statements/2011/oct/26/scott-walker/gop-gov-scott-walker-says-largest-category-technic/	We’ve heard the lousy job market has led many people to go back to school. But huge numbers of people with four-year degrees going to technical college? Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker spoke about technical colleges when he was asked about unemployment during a TV interview that was broadcast Oct. 16, 2011. He told CW14 in Green Bay he had repeatedly heard employers say "we have jobs, particularly good-paying manufacturing jobs, we just don’t have enough skilled workers, we don’t have enough people interested in those jobs." The Republican governor went on to say: "In fact, the largest category of people coming into the technical schools in Wisconsin are people with four-year degrees because the jobs that they’re looking for with their degrees aren’t there, and so instead they’re going back to school to get more technical training." Technical colleges have long been the next step for many students who have just finished high school and for experienced workers looking to upgrade their skills. So we wondered if those groups are now being outnumbered in Wisconsin’s technical schools by people with bachelor’s degrees. That’s what Walker said -- but it apparently isn’t what he meant. Walker spokesman Cullen Werwie told us in an email: "My understanding is that this quote was based on a conversation he had with tech college officials where they made a point to highlight the fact that one of the fastest growing enrollment demographics was individuals who have attended four-year colleges." That’s a far cry from Walker stated in the interview. He labeled college graduates the largest group entering technical schools. So, let’s dig into the numbers. Technical colleges are a key part of the discussion of how to attack unemployment in Wisconsin, where the jobless rate was 7.8 percent in September 2011, and at the national level. A few days after an October 2011 survey revealed that U.S. manufacturers lack qualified applicants for 600,000 skilled positions, the Wisconsin AFL-CIO cited the shortage and called on Walker to restore a 30 percent funding cut he made to technical colleges in the 2011-2013 state budget. The number of college graduates, meanwhile, who applied to U.S. graduate schools rose 8.4 percent in 2010, according to a September 2011 report from the Council of Graduate Schools. So, are an increasing number of four-year graduates heading to technical college, too? As of 2009, the number of four-year degree holders transferring into one of Wisconsin’s 16 technical colleges"had grown 30 percent in the last decade," according to a publication from the Wisconsin Technical College System. But that statistic is a bit dated and it deals with whether that group is increasing. A small set of individuals can still show a large percentage increase. Moreover, Walker referred to four-year grads in relation to other groups. So, we sought more information from Morna Foy, executive assistant and vice president of policy and government relations for the technical college system. Foy said she believed Walker was trying to repeat a statement that she and other technical college system officials had made -- that a growing percentage of transfer students into the technical colleges are students who already have four-year degrees. We asked her for a breakdown of transfer students who entered technical college in 2009, 2010 and 2011, to see if there were any trends. Foy emphasized that the 2011 figures were just being finalized, so Walker would not have been aware of them when he made his statement. The figures show that students with four-year degrees -- more specifically, those who had completed 16 or more years of schooling -- made up 15 percent of the nearly 10,000 technical college transfer students in 2009. The rate increased to 16 percent in 2010. So, based on figures that had been publicized when Walker did the TV interview, there was a 1-percentage-point increase between 2009 and 2010 in the number of people entering technical college who had four-year degrees. (The rate remained at 16 percent for 2011.) But in each of the three years, the largest category of students transferring into the technical colleges each year remained those who had completed 12 years of schooling -- in other words, high school graduates. High school graduates made up more than one-third of the transfer students each year, more than twice the level of four-year grads. Our conclusion Walker said "the largest category of people coming into the technical schools in Wisconsin are people with four-year degrees." Walker’s spokesman said the governor actually meant to claim that an increasing number of people with four-year degrees are going to technical college. Between 2009 and 2010, the percentage of college graduates entering technical college rose a bit. But high school graduates make up the largest category of transfer students in technical schools, far outnumbering those with college degrees. We rate Walker’s statement False.

pomt-02970	"No one beta-tested" healthcare.gov.	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2013/oct/22/sam-stein/huffington-posts-sam-stein-says-no-one-beta-tested/	The rollout of the Obama administration’s health insurance marketplaces website has been so roiled with problems -- from a pricing glitch, to flawed data, to widespread log-in fails -- that even journalists from left-leaning media are calling for top officials to be hauled before Congress. But while appearing on MSNBC’s Morning Joe, Huffington Post political editor Sam Stein went a bit too far in criticizing the agency’s prep work before the Oct. 1 launch of healthcare.gov. Or at least that's what he told us when we asked him. "It seems from all of the reporting, and from what I can gather, that up until very recently they (the Obama administration) didn’t realize how bad this was going to go out," Stein said on MSNBC. "And no one beta-tested the site, which is almost criminal when you think about it." The beta-testing line got picked up by conservative outlets such as the National Review and the Blaze, and we wanted to check it out. Stein directed us to a Washington Examiner report with a headline that somewhat contradicted his statement, which he acknowledged: "Troubled Obamacare website wasn’t tested until a week before launch." "Unfortunately, in the rush of cable news, I didn't add the clause ‘until a week before launch,’ " Stein told us. "I should have done that and apologize." That’s true. But Stein is more right than even he thinks, in part because he inadvertently used the word "beta" to describe the specific website testing. In the IT world, there are many kinds of tests under many kinds of names. Put another way, Stein goofed -- but by goofing, he got closer to the truth. Here’s what you need to know. The Examiner story, quoting someone speaking anonymously, said officials did not allow testing on the website until just days before it went live Oct. 1. The biggest problem, according to this report and others, was that leaders of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services decided to act as the central coordinator for the project (CMS would not tell the Examiner if the agency holds that role). The next day, the Washington Post described how government officials and contractors proceeded with the rollout despite a botched crucial test days earlier. They ran a simulation, unsuccessfully, in which a few hundred people tried to log onto the website at the same time. The failure proved an early warning of the bumpy road to come. Officials went forward with the launch, and the website "locked up" almost immediately when 2,000 users tried step one, the Post reported. Unnamed sources told the Post that an end-to-end trial run of the process did not happen by as late as Sept. 26, the week before the launch. (Here at PolitiFact we don't rely on unnamed sources, but the reports from the Examiner and the Post appear credible.) "Beta testing" is a very specific term in the tech world that most professional software goes through before launching. It comes after a product is in an "alpha" phase, or the earliest version of software that is subject to some tests to find any big issues. When a product reaches beta, it is tested by a larger group of people not connected to its development in an effort to gather feedback and make more fixes before a large-scale launch. Big tech companies like Google sometimes launch products in beta mode, but enterprise and government software vendors don’t usually do it that way, said Alexander Howard, former Washington correspondent for tech-centric O’Reilly Media and a fellow at the Tow Center for Digital Journalism at Columbia University. They stop adding features in the months preceding a launch to "start testing the heck out of it," Howard said. The development of healthcare.gov has been an entirely different story, he said, with no use of those terms. "The only thing we have is reporting that says the first testing occurred the last week before it went live, and then it went live," Howard said. "There was testing, but it’s not clear that it was in a beta version." According to published reports, healthcare.gov got additional features quite close to the launch, with no evidence of a consumer-centric test that went outside of the government. So Stein might have inartfully used the word beta-testing, but he might also have a point. "Even if those tests nominally did occur, they were as good as nonexistent based on the complexity of the project," said Patrick Ruffini, a Republican digital strategist. Testing of any kind was difficult because the specifications for the website were evolving the month before the website went up, said Gail Wilensky, senior fellow at Project Hope and former Medicare director under former President George H. W. Bush. The Post story, by the way, said a test group of 10 insurers that had access to the site advised the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services that the site was not ready to launch nationwide. Insurers have been in "regular communication" with government officials and contractors to test the back end of the site dealing with enrollment, Robert Zirkelbach, spokesman for the industry group America's Health Insurance Plans, told us. But most people are getting hung up on the earliest steps of setting up an account and verifying who they are. We reached out to CMS and CGI Federal, one of the main contractors for the website, but did not hear back. (We suspect they’re busy.) Our ruling Here’s what Stein said: "No one beta-tested" healthcare.gov. Stein, in fact, meant to say something else, he told us. But at PolitiFact we check the statements as they are made. In this case, Stein is closer to the truth than maybe even he thought. Stein specifically referred to beta testing on MSNBC, which is a phrase that traditionally means certain members of the public were allowed to access the website well before it opened. There's no evidence to suggest that happened, and the federal government isn't talking. Ultimately, this is a glitch of a statement talking about the glitches of a website. But it rates Mostly True.

pomt-08247	Portland Community College serves more students than all of the state’s universities combined.	false	/oregon/statements/2010/nov/13/portland-community-college/portland-community-college-tries-put-enrollment-nu/	It’s that time of the year again, when universities and colleges start to release their fall headcount numbers. Normally PolitiFact Oregon would leave this stuff to the education reporters -- except that one figure in the article Portland Community College wrote about its enrollment caught us by surprise. After noting the total student headcount for this fall -- 41,409 -- PCC went on to say that annually, it serves "more than 93,800 students ... (more than all of the state’s universities combined)." It was that last note that gave us pause. Could one community college really be serving more people than the entire state university system? We decided to find out. First, we went back to Portland Community College and asked for more specific numbers. Laura Massey, the college’s director of institutional analysis, said that for the 2009-2010 academic year, Portland Community College served roughly 93,799 students. So the news release had that number right. Next we went to the Oregon University System to check out their numbers. Bob Kieran, the assistant vice chancellor of institutional research and planning, told us that, for the same time period, the state-run universities served 122,883 students. It’s clear that, with these numbers, the statement in the PCC release doesn’t hold up. Before we issued a verdict, though, we decided to look at the numbers one other way. Overall student headcount can be a little misleading in that it counts every student, no matter the amount of time they actually spend on campus. Say you decide to take a single photography course for leisure, well, you’re counted the same as a student going to school full time in pursuit of a degree. Luckily, Oregon community colleges and universities are also required to report "full-time equivalent" numbers. That means they combine part-time students and count them as one full-time student. One full-time equivalent is equal to a student being fully enrolled for the fall, winter and spring terms of a given year. According to Massey, for the 2009-2010 school year, Portland Community College counted 31,395 full-time equivalents. Kieran says the entire Oregon University System counted 80,944. Again, the numbers don’t support the PCC claim. (That, of course, doesn’t diminish the fact that Portland Community College serves an awful lot of students each year.) James Hill, the man who wrote the enrollment numbers article, said that "it’s always been that case" that PCC served more students annually. He said he would review his numbers and thanked us for pointing out the discrepancy. Seeing as how neither the total headcount or full time equivalent figures back PCC up, we find this claim False.

pomt-08443	"If you want to see the jobs that I've saved and created in this storm he helped create, go anywhere in Ohio."	mostly true	/ohio/statements/2010/oct/16/lee-fisher/fisher-touts-job-development-success-stories-acros/	If Ohio voters take away one line from this years election, it will be that the state has lost 400,000 jobs. It's a number more ubiquitous than your ZIP code and the first talking point of GOP statewide candidates, from treasurer to governor. And its the mantra of Republican U.S. Senate candidate Rob Portman, a former congressman and top adviser to President George W. Bush. Portman uses the figure to put his Democratic opponent, Lt. Gov. Lee Fisher, on the defensive. That's because Fisher, who took office in January 2007, also served as the state's development director. That's the position responsible for creating jobs, and Fisher held the title until he announced his U.S. Senate bid in February 2009. PolitiFact Ohio has found the figure is accurate, ebbing and flowing from month-to-month, but that it leaves out a lot of context. Namely, the national recession influenced the states job losses more than any single politician, and the states been losing jobs under both Democrats and Republicans for more than a decade. Fisher blames the state's job losses entirely on the recession created by Bush's job and trade policies, which were influenced by Portman's two years in the White House. While Fisher offered the same defense again in the most recent debates, he also highlighted his argument that as lieutenant governor and development director, he was busy negotiating deals to save and create other jobs across the state. He drew loud applause from his hometown crowd at the Oct. 8 debate at the City Club of Cleveland when he walked off the stage with this line: "If you want to see the jobs that I've saved and created in this storm he helped create, go anywhere in Ohio. If you want to see the jobs he helped to create, go to Beijing, Shanghi, or Hong Kong." PolitiFact Ohio already has examined the second part of this statement. We thought now we'd examine the first part, that Fisher created or retained jobs around the state. Fisher is referring to a number of Ohio companies, some well known, such as Akron's Goodyear Tire & Rubber, and some much less familiar, such as Toledo's Xunslight Corp. So let's look at some of the deals he has mentioned by name in the debates and on the campaign trail: Goodyear: Fisher and his colleagues in the development department worked closely with Goodyear officials for months to put together a lucrative aid package that helped persuade the tire maker to build a new headquarters in Akron. Goodyear received a $20 million low-interest loan and $30 million in tax credits from Ohio. These were tied to keeping 2,900 workers for 15 years and its headquarters in Akron for 30 years. Of course, many others, notably Akron Mayor Don Plusquellic and developer Stuart Lichter, also played key roles. First Solar: The company started here using technology developed at the University of Toledo, but now is based in Arizona. It still has a production plant in Perrysburg. The company received a $225,000 grant in 2009 to expand that facility while Fisher headed the Ohio Department of Development. Amylin Pharmaceuticals: The San Diego-based company made a decision to open a facility near Cincinnati and later expand its operations before Fisher was in office. But in 2007, Gov. Ted Strickland's administration cut a deal to give the company a 10-year, 75 percent tax credit to encourage it to invest $400 million in an expansion project. At the time, the Cincinnati Enquirer quoted West Chester Township Trustee President George Lang, a Republican, crediting Fisher with helping get the deal done. Xunlight: The flexible solar panel maker received a $7 million loan from the state in 2008 through a couple of sources. The company has complimented the Strickland administrations focus on renewable energy. General Motors: On the verge of collapse just a couple of years ago, the company received support from both Bush and President Barack Obama. Fisher and other Democrats supported the federal governments decision to loan the company $50 billion. And Fisher and Strickland help secure a nearly $82 million state tax package for the company to help expand in 2008. While Fisher cant claim credit for being singularly responsible for landing any of these deals, he played a role as development director and lieutenant governor. And the state has helped far more companies than noted above. So, can you find Fisher handiwork in the four corners of the state, as he suggests? While he's adding a bit of rhetorical flair when he says, look anywhere in the state, he is conveying an accurate picture of his and the development department's work. So we rate his statement Mostly True.	None	Lee Fisher	None	None	None	2010-10-16T13:30:01	2010-10-08	['Ohio']
pomt-11943	"Loopholes in current law prevent ‘Unaccompanied Alien Children’ (UACs) that arrive in the country illegally from being removed."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2017/oct/11/donald-trump/donald-trump-omits-facts-claim-loopholes-minors-un/	President Donald Trump recently sent Congress a list of his immigration priorities as legislators consider a plan to allow Dreamers to stay in the United States. Dreamers are young people who grew up in the United States after being brought here illegally as children or infants. Trump has said he was willing to negotiate with Democrats in order to allow them to stay. In exchange, Trump is seeking changes to immigration law that would affect other minors who come to the United States illegally. "Loopholes in current law prevent ‘Unaccompanied Alien Children’ (UACs) that arrive in the country illegally from being removed," said Trump’s outline. "Rather than being deported, they are instead sheltered by the Department of Health and Human Services at taxpayer expense, and subsequently released to the custody of a parent or family member -- who often lack lawful status in the United States themselves." The children Trump is talking about tend to be from Central America, as opposed to Mexico. Waves of unaccompanied minors from Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador came to the United States in recent years fleeing gang violence and poverty. Trump wants to make it harder for these children to claim asylum (a type of relief sought by unaccompanied minors) and to be able to remove them all expeditiously. Typically, a loophole refers to an unintended consequence, ambiguity or omission from a law that allows something to be evaded. The Trump administration, however, deems the procedures laid out in law for treating unaccompanied minors as "loopholes" that need to be changed. But the law explicitly requires that a federal agency place children from non-border countries "in the least restrictive setting" (in many cases with family members) and to help them access legal counsel for their removal proceedings. Even with these procedures, however, thousands of children are still ordered removed. Trump’s claim gives a misleading impression. How the laws for unaccompanied minors work An Unaccompanied Alien Child is the legal term for a child who does not have a lawful immigration status in the United States; is under 18 years old; and has no parent or legal guardian in the United States, or for whom no parent or legal guardian in the United States is available to provide care and physical custody, according to U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services. The number of apprehensions of unaccompanied minors peaked in 2014 at 68,541, up from 38,759 in fiscal year 2013. Their apprehensions have fluctuated since 2014. Border Patrol agents tallied about 38,500 apprehensions of unaccompanied minors from October 2016 to August 2017. There have been concerns for years that unaccompanied minors were not being adequately screened to determine if they should be sent back to their countries. So Congress passed the William Wilberforce Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act of 2008, formalizing how they should be treated, and President George W. Bush signed it into law. "Special rules" in the law allow unaccompanied minors from contiguous countries (Mexico and Canada) to be quickly returned to their countries. But unaccompanied minors from other countries are not immediately sent back by immigration officers; they are placed in formal removal proceedings. The law requires that they be transferred within 72 hours to HHS, which places them "in the least restrictive setting that is in the best interest of the child." In many cases, children await their immigration court hearing while living with family members in the United States, including relatives who are in the country illegally. The law directs HHS to ensure "to the greatest extent practicable" that unaccompanied minors have access to legal counsel, including pro-bono services. The procedures for unaccompanied children cases are not loopholes, but rather basic requirements of the law, said Mark Greenberg, a senior fellow at the nonpartisan Migration Policy Institute and a former acting assistant secretary for the Administration for Children and Families within HHS during the Obama administration. Legal representation a factor in case outcome The most common immigration relief granted to unaccompanied minors includes asylum, special immigrant juvenile status, and "T nonimmigrant status" for victims of trafficking, said a January 2017 Congressional Research Service report. Data shows that children with an attorney are more likely to be allowed to stay in the country than children who lack representation. The Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse (TRAC) at Syracuse University examined outcomes for unaccompanied minors cases filed and decided from fiscal years 2012 to 2014. Outcomes for unaccompanied minors with an attorney (8,761 cases): In 73 percent of cases an immigration court allowed the child to stay in the United States, in 12 percent of cases a child was ordered removed, in 15 percent of cases a judge entered a "voluntary departure" order (child still has to leave the country, but the voluntary departure carries less severe consequences than a removal order). Outcomes for unaccompanied minors without an attorney (12,817 cases): In 15 percent of cases the child was allowed to stay in the country, in 80 percent of cases a child was given a removal order, and in 5 percent of cases, a voluntary departure order. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com Our ruling Trump said, "Loopholes in current law prevent ‘Unaccompanied Alien Children’ (UACs) that arrive in the country illegally from being removed." The Trump administration argues there is a loophole for unaccompanied minors primarily from Central America. They are referred to HHS and in many cases placed with family members while they await their immigration court hearing. The law directs HHS to try to connect unaccompanied minors with legal counsel, and having an attorney can help them win their case and allow them to stay in the United States. But this process is not a loophole; it’s outlined in the law. The law also does not prevent their deportation: at least 2,707 unaccompanied minors were removed in fiscal year 2017. The statement has an element of truth but leaves out critical context that would give a different impression. We rate it Mostly False.

pomt-01536	"New Hampshire has lost more jobs to China than any other state."	half-true	/new-hampshire/statements/2014/sep/16/senate-majority-pac/ad-targeting-scott-brown-says-new-hampshire-has-lo/	As Election Day draws nearer, the New Hampshire Senate race has grown in prominence nationally. With polls showing the contest between Democratic incumbent Jeanne Shaheen and Republican challenger Scott Brown closer than ever, both candidates -- and their independent allies -- are airing hard-hitting attack ads, hoping a victory might sway control of the U.S. Senate. One ad released on Sept. 15, 2014, by the Senate Majority PAC, a Democratic-aligned independent group, takes aim at Brown for his alleged support for outsourcing jobs. Part of the ad piqued our interest: "New Hampshire has lost more jobs to China than any other state," the narrator says. Accompanying the narration was a visual that said, "NH has lost more jobs to China than any other state." Given that New Hampshire ranks as only the 42nd biggest state in population, that claim sounded odd. So we decided to take a look. Senate Majority PAC did not respond to an inquiry, but we found the Union Leader article cited in the ad. It covered the publication of a study in 2012 by the Economic Policy Institute, a liberal group based in Washington. It’s worth noting that the report’s authors cautioned that "it is not a statistical survey of actual jobs gained or lost in individual companies, or the opening or closing of particular production facilities." Rather, the group fed federal trade and employment data into a mathematical model to estimate how many jobs were displaced by trade with China between 2001 and 2011. So what did the study find? It found that New Hampshire ranked first among the 50 states in the estimated number jobs lost to China -- as a percentage of the state workforce. That’s similar to, but not the same as, the ad’s language. The ad talked about the number of jobs, not jobs as a percentage of the workforce. If you measure estimated job losses by the raw number instead of the percentage of the workforce, then New Hampshire, a relatively small state, falls far down the list. New Hampshire is tied for the 29th out of the 50 states on the list of estimated job losses. And on the list of congressional districts in the report, neither of New Hampshire’s two districts rank among the top 20 nationally for estimated job losses to China. We’ll close by noting that the Union Leader’s headline got it right, but the ad’s version of that headline dropped four key words at the end. The article said, "NH has lost more jobs to China than any other state, 2.94% of total workforce." Our ruling The Senate Majority PAC ad said that "New Hampshire has lost more jobs to China than any other state." First, the ad did not note that this was an estimate, rather than a hard number of actual jobs lost to China. Second, the estimate was that New Hampshire lost the biggest percentage of its workforce -- not most jobs -- to China. We have no quarrel with the use of workforce percentages as the yardstick for this comparison, since doing so makes it possible to fairly compare 50 states that have widely disparate numbers of residents. But the distinction between jobs and percentage of the workforce should have been reflected in the ad. Otherwise, it makes the ad’s claim seem more powerful than it is. The claim is partially accurate but leaves out important details, so we rate it Half True.	None	Senate Majority PAC	None	None	None	2014-09-16T16:46:42	2014-09-15	['China']

pomt-06199	I differed with my party on business legislation, on consumer protection, and on free trade agreements.	false	/oregon/statements/2011/dec/10/suzanne-bonamici/suzanne-bonamici-says-shes-different-other-democra/	The two major party candidates vying for a congressional seat in January’s 1st District special election both claim to be independent and bipartisan. At a recent debate co-hosted by the Independent Party of Oregon, former Democratic state Sen. Suzanne Bonamici and Republican businessman Rob Cornilles were asked to provide hard evidence. John Schrag of The Forest Grove News-Times asked: "...Can you provide three specific examples of where you differ from your party on matters of policy that are either now before Congress or we can expect to come before Congress in the next couple of years?" We will consider Bonamici’s three examples, on business, consumer protection and free trade, with this question in mind: Did she, in fact, differ with her party on matters of policy? Overall, Bonamici said she looks at policy on its merits, regardless of the forces behind it. "And that happened in the last session, when my party Democratic chair didn’t want to hear a bill that I thought was good for Oregon business. I convinced that chair to hear the bill, it passed and it’s helping an Oregon business right now," she said. House Bill 2095, now law, allows Oregon to join a multi-state compact that makes it easier for insurers to offer new products. It passed out of the Oregon House on a 48-10 vote and landed in the consumer protection committee of Sen. Chip Shields, D-Portland. He was afraid the compact would erode local oversight. Bonamici favored the bill and convinced him to allow a vote in committee. "She bucked a Democratic chairman; no one would have had an opportunity (to vote) had she not taken on her Democratic chairman," said Carol Butler, Bonamici’s campaign manager. Still, the proposal cleared the Senate 28-2. While the no votes came from Democrats, most in her party supported the bill. We give her credit for changing Shields’ mind, but we rule this portion False. Bonamici: "Another place where I’ve differed -- in fact I’ve become a leader in my party -- and that’s on consumer protection issues: cracking down on mortgage fraud, making sure that people who are facing foreclosure have all the opportunities that they can to prevent losing their home, protecting seniors and middle class families from scams. I’ve been a leader and strengthened my party in that way." That’s a sweet talking point. But consumer protection is an issue on which Democrats have long prided themselves. Oregon Senate Democrats highlighted the issue as an agenda item for the 2011 Legislature -- and proudly claimed success after the session. Still, the director of Economic Fairness Oregon insists that many Democrats would have been happy approving watered-down legislation if not for Bonamici’s advocacy. "The best example," said Angela Martin, "is in her advocacy of consumer protection with teeth." So let’s accept that Bonamici goaded skittish Democrats into supporting more consumer friendly legislation. That still doesn’t make up for the fact that siding with consumers is supposed to be a key part of the Democratic Party platform. To suggest otherwise is silly. We could rate this a Pants on Fire. Bonamici: "And finally, during this campaign I could have taken the easy way in a primary campaign and said I wouldn’t support the free trade agreements that were pending before Congress. I took my time and did research and came to a reasoned conclusion about those, rather than just take a party line approach on those." Congress approved agreements with South Korea, Colombia, and Panama, earlier this year. Generally, businesses like trade agreements as a way to get goods into other countries. Labor groups argue they will lose jobs. In the special primary election, Bonamici’s main rivals came out against the trade agreements. Bonamici refused to take a position then, saying that she would need specifics in order to vote. Job creation in the district would be her main criterion. But is being opposed to free trade the party-line approach? Oregon’s Democratic delegation split on the proposals. Sen. Ron Wyden and Reps. Earl Blumenauer and Kurt Schrader came down on the free-trade side (although Blumenauer and Schrader did vote against the pact with Colombia, where there are particular concerns over the killing of unionists). Sen. Jeff Merkley and Rep. Peter DeFazio voted against all three. Bonamici now says she would vote for the South Korean agreement, but against the other two. We don’t see how her position differs with those in her party. Democrats in Congress split. But we’ll give her a Mostly False, because she was under pressure from her primary opponents. We get what Bonamici is trying to say. In the first case, she differed with Shields, a Democrat, who controlled the committee, but not from the rest of her caucus. In the second case, she differed with some Democrats who, according to one lobbyist, had to be coaxed into tougher legislation. In the third case, she differed with her primary opponents. But that doesn’t mean she’s differed with Democrats on matters of policy. We combine the three mini-rulings to come up with a False.

pomt-14008	The presence of gorillas calls into question the concept of evolution.	false	/punditfact/statements/2016/jun/03/rush-limbaugh/rush-limbaugh-asks-why-cincinnati-zoo-gorilla-hadn/	A question for the ages: Why is a gorilla a gorilla, and not a human? Conservative radio host Rush Limbaugh wondered aloud about primate evolution while discussing the case of a boy who fell into a gorilla enclosure at a Cincinnati zoo. Limbaugh said the zoo keepers did the right thing when they made the difficult but necessary choice to shoot and kill Harambe, a 400-pound male gorilla, to protect the toddler in the May 28 incident. But some animal activists are outraged at the death of a critically endangered animal. One dimension of this outrage, Limbaugh said, is people think they’re related to gorillas. "A lot of people think that all of us used to be gorillas, and they're looking for the missing link out there," Limbaugh said. "The evolution crowd. They think we were originally apes. I've always had a question: If we were the original apes, then how come Harambe is still an ape, and how come he didn't become one of us?" Limbaugh has delivered mixed messages on his belief in evolution in the past. In 2004, he asked why chimpanzees and baboons "got stuck being idiot gorillas" instead of becoming humans. Then in 2010, he said, "clearly things evolve," while still expressing skepticism about the progression of human and primate evolution. We thought we’d take the opportunity to answer Limbaugh’s question and explain why the presence of gorillas doesn’t negate the concept of evolution. Humans are apes, as members of the taxonomic family hominidae, which also includes the great apes — orangutans, chimpanzees and gorillas. Humans, the great apes, monkeys and more are all primates. However, humans didn’t evolve from gorillas or other apes, as Limbaugh suggests. Rather humans, gorillas and all other apes evolved from a common ape-like ancestor (now extinct) around 5 million to 8 million years ago. See the primate family tree to the left. Scientists know this from studying the comparative anatomy and DNA for humans and other creatures, said Blythe Williams, a professor of evolutionary anthropology at Duke University. "Each species has changed over time," Williams said. "For reasons that are not clear, our own species has changed in some very dramatic ways, such as becoming bipedal and getting really big brained." Some experts believe this common ancestor was chimp-like, while others think it might have been different from anything currently living, said David Pilbeam, professor of human evolution at Harvard University. Williams said the question Limbaugh poses — why gorillas and humans coexist despite evolution — is akin to asking why Rush Limbaugh hasn’t evolved into his cousin, Stephen, or vice-versa. The two share a common ancestor, but they’re not the same person. "They are different people, with some shared DNA," Williams said. "But because of the introduction of other genes into their gene pool, via parents, they are not exactly the same as one another or their shared grandparent." So it’s not that there was a linear progression from gorillas to humans, and some gorillas just didn’t evolve. It’s that over some 6 million years, descendants of a single, common species became gorillas, and others became humans. "Evolution, including human evolution, doesn't have a goal beyond survival and reproduction," Pilbeam said, making the argument that becoming human isn’t the end-all-be-all in evolution. Homo sapiens are the only remaining human species, having emerged about 200,000 years ago, though there used to be numerous human species, including our closest extinct relative, the neanderthal. Certain genes differ just 1.8 percent between humans and gorillas. The difference in those genes is about 1.2 percent between humans and our closest animal relative, the chimpanzee. Our ruling Limbaugh said the presence of gorillas calls into question the concept of evolution. Limbaugh hit on a common misconception that humans evolved from modern-day apes. In reality, modern-day humans and modern-day gorillas are cousins, having both evolved from a common, but now extinct, ancestor.

pomt-13728	"As secretary of state, (Hillary Clinton) worked hard to get strong sanctions against Iran's nuclear program" and "got Russia and China to support them."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/jul/27/bill-clinton/bill-clinton-praises-hillarys-half-court-shot-iran/	President Barack Obama had to ask Hillary Clinton more than once if she would be his secretary of state, but it was worth the effort, former President Bill Clinton said in a speech praising his wife’s record. "As secretary of state, she worked hard to get strong sanctions against Iran's nuclear program," Clinton said on the second night of the 2016 Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia. "And in what the Wall Street Journal no less called a half-court shot at the buzzer, she got Russia and China to support them." This sounded like a fact-check we’ve done before. On the campaign trail, Hillary Clinton has said she put together the sanctions that helped usher Iran to the negotiating table, ultimately resulting in the landmark nuclear deal. We rated this claim Mostly True. Throughout her first 18 months as secretary of state — from January 2009 to June 2010 — U.S. and global sanctions on Iran increased, and it’s fair to say that Clinton and the State Department played a major role in this development. The invitation Upping sanctions on Iran was a clear priority for Clinton’s State Department. She talked at length about the importance of pressuring Iran to discontinue nuclear activity, including through sanctions, at her nomination hearing in January 2009. She and other members of the Obama administration spoke publicly about the topic regularly. The State Department, including top aides and Clinton herself, led the diplomatic effort to get other countries to join the U.S. plan to pressure Iran, overcoming large hurdles such as getting Russia and China on board. In her memoir Hard Choices, Clinton recalls hashing out final details of a plan over drinks with a Chinese official. The New York Times reported that she personally talked with Russian foreign minister Sergey Lavrov. As Bill Clinton said in his speech, a Wall Street Journal editorial did call this feat "a half-court shot at the buzzer." In June 2010, the United Nations Security Council approved tough new sanctions on Iran, including expanding an arms embargo and restricting certain financial and shipping enterprises. At the time, Obama called them "the toughest sanctions ever faced by the Iranian government." Those sanctions enabled even tougher measures from the United States and the European Union, which were passed immediately. Congress passed several more bills containing additional sanctions on Iran during the rest of Clinton’s tenure, which ended in early 2013. While the Treasury Department is the primary agency responsible for enforcing sanctions, Clinton appointed a special adviser in 2010 to oversee U.S. efforts "to ensure full and effective implementation of all U.N. Security Council resolutions related to Iran, including most recently UNSCR 1929." Experts told us that Clinton is correct to take some of the credit for the rapid increase in international sanctions on Iran, and these sanctions were a big part of the reason why Iran rejoined multilateral talks about its nuclear program. The RSVP The State Department was key to getting other countries to go along with and add to U.S. efforts to pressure Iran, said Patrick Clawson, senior fellow and research director at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy. The international sanction ramp-up "shocked Iran's leaders," Clawson said. "Besides the pain the sanctions inflicted, they raised the possibility more — worse — was coming. That was a key factor pushing Iran to resume more serious talks." There is room for subjective interpretation on who deserves the credit for effective sanctions because many corners of the U.S. government are involved in the Iran effort, said Suzanne Maloney, deputy director of the foreign policy program at the Brookings Institution. But the State Department had its hands in every aspect of new sanction-making and implementation. And in the absence of the United Nations resolution, which was Clinton’s lobbying success, it would have been challenging to get a global coalition to significantly ramp up the sanctions, she said. But whether sanctions were a big factor in bringing Iran to the negotiating table is not crystal clear, Maloney said. Iranian officials have historically denied the significance of sanctions, but Ayatollah Ali Khamenei has said recently that Iran negotiated the deal specifically to have sanctions lifted. Beyond the multilateral effort, Clinton’s team also played a role in the sanctions that Congress passed, said Richard Nephew, an expert on sanctions with the Center on Global Energy Policy at Columbia University. Lawmakers would not have written that legislation without consulting the State Department and the administration (as evidenced in this 2010 New York Times article). Nephew noted, though, that Congress did pass some sanctions that went further than the administration’s wishes. "Without Secretary Clinton's good diplomacy— and the message that she radiated down the system to make this a priority and so forth — you can argue that the reductions would not have been as steep or as lasting," Nephew said. Congress’ sanctions that affect Iran’s oil exports resulted in a 50 percent reduction in oil exports and were instrumental in getting Iran to the negotiating table, said Nephew, who worked at the State Department under Clinton. Our ruling Bill Clinton said, "As secretary of state, (Hillary Clinton) worked hard to get strong sanctions against Iran's nuclear program" and "got Russia and China to support them." During Hillary Clinton’s first 18 months as secretary, the State Department led the global effort to increase sanctions on Iran — notably getting Russia and China on board — culminating in an important U.N. resolution. Clinton was personally involved in these diplomatic efforts and pushed them publicly. Experts said these sanctions, on top of other sanctions passed before and after, were crucial to getting Iran to the negotiating table. However, Clinton wasn’t singularly responsible for the sanctions or getting China and Russia to support them, just as the sanctions passed under her watch likely weren’t singularly responsible for opening up Iran to talks.

pomt-08553	"An organized crime syndicate was extorting money from his (Tom Ganley’s) business, threatening his family, but he fought back and won the FBI's highest civilian award"	true	/ohio/statements/2010/sep/30/tom-ganley/tom-ganley-touts-role-fbi-investigation/	Tom Ganley is the largest automobile dealer in Ohio, and the owner of other businesses including insurance, real estate, aviation, and finance companies. But it is a reference to his encounter with organized crime in the 1980s that opens the first TV ad in his GOP campaign for Congress against 13th district Democratic Rep. Betty Sutton: "An organized crime syndicate was extorting money from his business, threatening his family, but he fought back and won the FBI's highest civilian award." PolitiFact Ohio earlier gave Ganley a rating of Barely True rating for his claim, in a Sept. 13 interview with The Plain Dealer’s editorial board, that he took down the mob in Northeast Ohio. That claim overstated his role. Truth be told, though, we felt bad about putting a mark against Ganley’s reputation in what is, by all accounts, a laudable act: endangering himself in the interest of justice. He was instrumental in helping the Justice Department put several dangerous criminals behind bars. We wondered whether his overstatement to the newspaper’s editorial board is how he has been portraying his role in the investigation to the public. Before we get to what we found, we note, in the interest of transparency, that Ganley is a major advertiser in The Plain Dealer. We did not find that Ganley has overstated his role in the investigation when speaking to the public, although others have. Generally, Ganley has portrayed his role the way he portrays it in his political ad: someone who helped the FBI with an investigation. Our reporting for the earlier PolitiFact item backs up what the TV ad says. Articles in The Plain Dealer archives show that two organized crime figures -- former Teamsters Union leader John J. (Skip) Felice and Joseph C. Ilaqua -- were sent to prison by U.S. District Judge Alvin I. Krenzler in July 1983 after pleading guilty to conspiring to extort $10,000 and a car from Ganley in 1981 and 1982. The indictment against Felice said he told Ganley in April 1981 that high ranking organized crime figures wanted Ganley killed, and that Felice could get the contract canceled in exchange for money. Ganley wore a wire when he met with the extortionists and asked questions at the FBI's request to help the bureau crack other cases, former FBI agents said. "During this investigation, it became evident to these organized crime members that Mr. Ganley was cooperating with the FBI and that he would be testifying against them at trial," says a 2007 press release the FBI issued when it gave Ganley its Louis E. Peters Memorial Service Award. "This realization resulted in additional death threats directed at Mr. Ganley and his family. Mr. Ganley refused to be intimidated by these criminals and consented to having FBI agents live at his residence to provide security for himself and his family." Retired FBI agents contacted by The Plain Dealer described Ganley’s actions as courageous and important to the FBI’s investigative strategy. We rate the claim in his television ad to be True.

pomt-07849	"In the month of January, Canada created more new jobs than we did."	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/feb/11/mitt-romney/mitt-romney-tells-cpac-canada-created-more-jobs-ja/	At the Conservative Political Action Conference, an annual pep rally for the political right, former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney complained that the economy had not recovered under President Barack Obama. He said, "Today there are more men and women out of work in America than there are people working in Canada. And in the month of January, Canada created more new jobs than we did." We’ll look separately at these two claims, which came from his CPAC speech on Feb. 11, 2011. In this item, we’ll analyze the claim that "in the month of January, Canada created more new jobs than we did." We found the relevant data for Canada at the website of Statistics Canada. For the month concluding in January 2011, Canada created a net 69,200 jobs. For the U.S. numbers, we turned to the Bureau of Labor Statistics and found Romney is correct. Over the same period, the U.S. created a net 36,000 jobs. So the U.S. created about half as many jobs even though it is nine times larger than Canada. It's worth noting that U.S. job growth was substantially stronger than Canadian job growth in each of the previous three months. In October, the U.S. economy created 171,000 jobs, compared to just 3,000 for Canada. In November 2010, the U.S. economy created 93,000 jobs, compared to 15,200 for Canada. And in December 2010, the U.S. created 121,000 jobs, compared to 22,000 for Canada. But on a per capita basis, in recent months U.S. job creation exceeded Canada's only in October. January happened to be a month when U.S. job creation was especially low and Canadian job creation was especially high, but it is the most recent month and it reflects the general pattern when you account for population. We find the claim True.	None	Mitt Romney	None	None	None	2011-02-11T17:19:04	2011-02-11	['Canada']
pomt-10668	"Sixty-five percent of the Iraqi people now say it's okay to shoot an American soldier."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2007/dec/21/bill-richardson/he-hypes-the-language-the-numbers/	In a Democratic debate on Nov. 15, 2007, Bill Richardson had a startling way to support his view that the situation in Iraq is not improving: "What I'm saying, also, is that look at this statistic — 65 percent of the Iraqi people now say it's okay to shoot an American soldier." Where did that number come from? Katie Roberts, Richardson's deputy communications director, points to a BBC-sponsored poll of Iraqis in September 2007. BBC says the poll was conducted in face-to-face interviews with 2,212 people "in more than 450 neighborhoods across all 18 provinces of Iraq in August, and has a margin of error of plus or minus 2.5%." But the poll does not directly support the 65 percent figure. Nor does the poll put the question nearly as starkly as Richardson stated. "Thinking about the political action of other people," the question says, "do you find each of these items to be acceptable or not acceptable?" The first item was "attacks on coalition forces," and 57 percent of the respondents found them "acceptable." Among Sunnis, 93 percent said "acceptable;" among Shiites, it was 50 percent, and among Kurds, it was 5 percent. It's not at all clear that the same number would have said it is acceptable if people had been asked, "Is it okay to shoot an American soldier?" So Richardson is at least casting the response in more dramatic terms than the question interviewers asked. At the same time, the poll clearly suggests that about half of the Iraqi people consider attacks on coalition forces "acceptable." The Richardson campaign did not respond to our request to explain the disparity in numbers. Polling expert John G. Geer, professor of political science at Vanderbilt University and editor of the forthcoming Encyclopedia of Public Opinion, theorized that Richardson excluded the responses of Kurds. Sure enough, if you subtract the 354 Kurd responses from the 2,212 total, the math supports Richardson's 65 percent figure. This makes sense if you consider many Kurds would eventually like to have a state of their own. But removing the Kurds exaggerates the poll results and does not accurately reflect Richardson's statement, which referred only to "the Iraqi people." "The question," says Geer, "is whether 'attacks on coalition forces' equates to 'shooting an American soldier,' which of course it doesn't. Possibly they'd be more likely to say it's acceptable, I don't know." He adds, "It's generally a fair point to say Iraqis are unhappy with the American presence in Iraq. The general point has some validity, but he's exaggerated. That's what campaigns do." And what we do is call them on it. Richardson wasn't just "juicing the numbers," as Geer said. He was deliberately hyping the language and hyping the numbers to make a stronger point than the facts justified. The best we can rule is Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.

pomt-04883	"As president, Barack Obama has never visited Israel."	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/aug/07/mitt-romney/romney-says-obama-has-not-visited-israel-president/	Following a trip in which he said Israel was blessed by the hand of providence, Mitt Romney is out with an ad questioning President Barack Obama’s allegiance to the Jewish state. "Who shares your values?" a narrator asks as an image of Obama appears. "As president, Barack Obama has never visited Israel and refuses to recognize Jerusalem as its capital." Romney, the ad continues, "will be a different kind of president who stands by our allies. He knows America holds a deep and cherished relationship with Israel." The ad closes with clips of Romney giving a speech in front of the Old City and praying at the Western Wall. In another fact-check, we’ll look at the ad’s claims about Obama’s record on Jerusalem as the nation's capital. Here, we ask, has the president been there? Before he moved to the White House As an Illinois senator, Obama made his first visit to Israel in January of 2006. In 2008, while running for president, he returned on a multi-nation trip to Israel, Jordan, Germany, France and Britain. That trip, like Romney’s this year, was designed to bolster his foreign policy credentials. At the time, Obama declared America a friend of Israel and said we "must always stand up for Israel's right to defend itself." But Romney’s ad specified that Obama has not been to Israel "as president," and that assertion is correct. As it turns out, that’s not unusual. Our colleagues at the Washington Post’s Fact-Checker column delved into the archives of the historian’s office at the U.S. State Department. According to those records, seven of the last 11 presidents (dating back to Harry Truman who was in the White House when Israel was established) never visited Israel. The Obama campaign, when we asked for a response, pointed out that Republicans Ronald Reagan and George H. W. Bush were among those who never went to Israel. Democratic Presidents Jimmy Carter and Bill Clinton were the only ones to visit during their first term. George W. Bush went to Israel twice during his last year in office. That historical context is noteworthy: A majority of the last 11 presidents did not visit Israel. But the Romney ad’s claim is still accurate. We rate it True.

pomt-00714	Algeria "wanted to be taken off of the terror list" at the time it made an unreported donation to the Clinton Foundation.	false	/punditfact/statements/2015/apr/28/joe-scarborough/scarborough-says-algeria-donated-clinton-foundatio/	Television pundits are raising a lot of questions about foreign government donations to the Clinton Foundation during Hillary Clinton’s tenure as secretary of state. But not everyone get all the details right. Joe Scarborough of MSNBC’s Morning Joe flubbed describing the situation in the April 27 show. He was discussing a column by the Washington Post’s Ruth Marcus, whose op-ed highlighted an unreported donation to Bill Clinton’s foundation by Algeria in 2010 as an example of sloppiness. The donation, and others like it, raises questions about whether Clinton went "soft" on Algeria for contributing to her husband’s cause under the appearance of earthquake relief in Haiti, Marcus wrote. Scarborough said the situation will "stink to high heaven" even if it’s a legal gray area. "I think it was Algeria, maybe, that had given a donation that went unreported at a time when they wanted to be taken off of the terror list in the State Department," Scarborough said. "They write the check, they get taken off the terror list. ... At the same time, and then it goes unreported by the Clinton Foundation." "Is there a quid pro quo there? I don't know, that's really hard to tell," he said. Scarborough went on to break down to his panelists how easy it would be to explain to voters what might have occurred. "This is pretty simple stuff. So Algeria is on the terror list, they want off the terror list, the State Department's making a decision to do it, they write a check for what? How much? How many million dollars do they write a check for? I don't know, but Algeria writes a check. You're from Boston, you know how politics works. They write a really big check to the Clinton Foundation," Scarborough said. "The Clinton Foundation takes the check, and then just, out of nowhere the State Department then decides, well, they are going to take Algeria off the list. Now why did Algeria write a big check to the Clinton Foundation at the time they want something from the State Department? That's pretty simple for most voters." The problem with all of this isn’t the donation, or questions about a quid pro quo with Algeria. It’s the fact that Algeria wasn’t ever on the terror list. (Media Matters first pointed out what Scarborough said.) An ally against terror The list Scarborough mentions is a serious designation given to just four countries the State Department considers state sponsors of terrorism: Syria, Iran, Sudan and Cuba. President Barack Obama is poised to remove Cuba from the list as a show of improved diplomatic relations. (Libya, Iraq and North Korea are the only countries that have been removed.) Algeria is actually a key partner of the United States in fighting terrorism in North Africa and "has a long history of fighting terrorism," the State Department says. The country spent about 20 years locked in a civil war between the military and various Islamist groups after an Islamist group won a 1991 election that was scrapped. The country’s president, Abdelaziz Bouteflika, lifted a state of emergency in April 2011. But the country continues to struggle with radical violence in neighboring countries. Algeria was attacked by the group that calls itself al-Qaida in the Lands of the Islamic Maghreb almost 200 times in just 2013 in the form of improvised explosive devices, bombings, kidnappings, and fake roadblocks. Human rights violations hamper relations The Algerian government is not a state sponsor of terror. But its hands are not clean when it comes to human rights, which is most likely what Scarborough was trying to recall on air. The Washington Post story that revealed the Algerian embassy’s donation of $500,000 also mention that the one-time gift coincided with increased lobbying visits to the State Department about human rights violations. In 2010, Algeria spent more than $420,000 lobbying American officials on inter-country relations and on "human rights issues," the Post found, citing documents filed as part of the Foreign Agents Registration Act. The year also saw an increase in meetings between State Department officials and lobbyists representing Algeria, growing from "a handful" of recorded visits in the years before and after to 12 visits in 2010, the Post reported. The Algeria donation came soon after the Jan. 12, 2010, earthquake in Haiti, the Clinton Foundation said. It was unsolicited and went to the Clinton Foundation Haiti Relief Fund, "where the entire amount of Algeria’s contribution was distributed as aid in Haiti." Algeria had not donated before and has not donated since, a foundation spokesman said. The foundation acknowledged it did not alert the State Department about the gift for vetting, which was required under a memorandum of understanding between the Obama administration and the Clintons in an effort to prevent foreign governments from trying to curry favor with Hillary Clinton’s State Department by donating to Bill Clinton’s philanthropy. So what are the human rights issues Algeria was lobbying on? Reports by Human Rights Watch, Amnesty International and the State Department outline the activities of a strict authoritarian government that represses its people’s freedom of assembly and association, overuses pretrial detentions, and employs a judicial system that is susceptible to corruption. The State Department’s 2010 report of human rights issues in Algeria highlights more issues including reports of arbitrary killings, the government failing to account for people who disappeared during the civil war in the 1990s, violence and discrimination against women, and continued restrictions for workers’ rights. The government of Algeria has resisted inspections by independent human rights groups. MSNBC's Diana Rocco said Scarborough deserves some credit for indicating he "wasn’t sure it was" Algeria, and that the exchange that followed "clearly shows he’s using it as a hypothetical scenario to make his larger point about how the quid pro quo scenario may have unfolded." None of that, though, means that Algeria was on the terror watch list in the first place. Neither Algeria nor other governments revealed to have given to the foundation — Australia, the Dominican Republic, Kuwait, Norway, Oman and Qatar — are sponsors of terrorism, either. Our ruling Scarborough was trying to recall the details of a news story about Clinton Foundation donations from foreign governments when he brought up Algeria’s donation to the foundation to try getting off the "terror list." There are parts about the donations that may not look good for Clinton. Maybe it becomes a legal problem, maybe it’s just a political one. But to claim the foundation took donations from a country on the terrorist list is inaccurate. Scarborough’s claim rates False.

pomt-02381	In the U.S., "African-Americans continue to be arrested at nearly three and one half times the rate of whites" on marijuana charges.	true	/rhode-island/statements/2014/mar/16/naacp/new-england-naacp-says-african-americans-us-are-ar/	While there’s a growing debate over whether to legalize marijuana, some are troubled by what they see as unfairness in enforcement of existing laws. Among them is the New England Area Conference of the NAACP. The organization released a statement March 3 in support of a Rhode Island House bill that would legalize using marijuana or possessing up to an ounce. Currently, possession of an ounce or less of marijuana is a civil offense, punishable by a $150 fine. Among their reasons for supporting that change, the statement said, was that in the United States, African-Americans were 3.7 times more likely than whites to get arrested on marijuana charges, based on the number of arrests and their share of the nation’s population. James Vincent, president of the Providence NAACP, said the claim was based on a June 2013 report by the American Civil Liberties Union, "The War on Marijuana in Black and White." That report charted how many blacks and whites were arrested for marijuana possession and then, based on the racial population of each state, what the marijuana arrest rate per 100,000 people was for each race. The ACLU report used statistics compiled by the FBI’s Uniform Crime Reporting Program, a wide-ranging database of annual crime statistics that are often used in national crime studies because each state submits the same type of information, which allows apples-to-apples comparisons. Nationally, according to the report, the marijuana arrest rate for African-Americans in 2010 was 716 per 100,000, while for whites it was 192 per 100,000, meaning African-Americans were 3.7 times more likely to be arrested for marijuana possession. The disparities were present across the country; in some states, the arrest rate for African-Americans was as much as 8.3 times the white rate. In Rhode Island, before possession of small amounts of marijuana was decriminalized, the arrest rate for African-Americans was 524 per 100,000, while the rate for whites was 201 per 100,000. That meant African-Americans were 2.6 times more likely to be arrested on marijuana charges than their white fellow citizens. That Rhode Island disparity was specifically cited in the bill text as a proposed "legislative finding" justifying enactment of the legislation. The authors of the ACLU report cautioned the FBI data wasn’t perfect. They noted that the FBI didn’t count Latinos as a separate group, usually putting them in the ‘‘white’’ classification. That has the effect of preventing an accurate measurement of Latino arrests and inflating the number of white arrests, the report said. The authors said more research could be done to explore how other factors, such as past criminal records, age of the persons arrested or the population density of the location of the arrest might affect the arrest rates. The authors said they weren’t trying to prove or disprove a particular theory on why the disparities they found existed, just that the disparities were there. And they aren’t the first to study the issue. In 2009, Human Rights Watch, based in Washington, D.C., did a similar study, "Decades of Disparity, Drug Arrests and Race in the United States." While the ACLU study focused on marijuana possession arrests, the Human Rights Watch looked at all drug arrests by race from 1980 to 2007. Like the ACLU, Human Rights Watch used the FBI statistics and found arrest rates for blacks were multiple times higher than whites. In the last year it analyzed, 2007, it found African-Americans were 3.6 times more likely to be arrested on a drug charge, close to the ACLU’s 3.7 multiple for marijuana arrests in 2010. Our ruling The NAACP New England Area Conference said "African-Americans continue to be arrested at nearly three and one half times the rate of whites" on marijuana charges. The group accurately cited a nationwide study that used a widely accepted data source, and a similar study done a few years earlier found almost the same disparity. We find the statement True.

pomt-05239	"Women have come through the recession worse off than men … the numbers bear that out. We went from a 7 percent unemployment rate for women when he (President Barack Obama) was elected to an 8.1 percent now."	mostly true	/new-jersey/statements/2012/jun/04/caroline-casagrande/caroline-casagrande-says-women-have-come-through-r/	The recession and its aftereffects have been hard on millions of people across the country. But it’s been especially hard on women, according to state Assemblywoman Caroline Casagrande (R-Monmouth). "Women have come through the recession worse off than men … the numbers bear that out," Casagrande said to My9TV’s Brenda Blackmon on the April 29 "New Jersey Now" program. "We went from a 7 percent unemployment rate for women when he (President Barack Obama) was elected to an 8.1 percent now." Casagrande is correct about most of her data, PolitiFact New Jersey found. Obama was elected in November 2008 and took office on Jan. 20, 2009. Anita Velardo, Casagrande’s communications director, said in an e-mail that Casagrande’s statistic referred to the period from January 2009 to March 2012. But since Casagrande said elected, we’ll look at the unemployment rate for both periods. From November 2008 to March 2012, unemployment among women rose to 8.1 percent from 6.2 percent, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. For men, the rate climbed to 8.3 percent from 7.4 percent. From January 2009 to March 2012, unemployment for women rose from 7 percent to 8.1 percent. The rate for men, however, decreased from 8.6 percent to 8.3 percent. That’s because the male-dominated industries that lost jobs prior to January 2009 were starting to rebound. Now let’s look at data for the recession, which the nonprofit National Bureau of Economic Research said occurred from December 2007 to June 2009. During the recession, unemployment among women spiked from 4.9 percent to 8.3 percent. For men, the rate more than doubled, from 5.1 percent to 10.6 percent. Men’s unemployment was higher than women during the recession, but women have had a tougher time getting work and living day-to-day during the ongoing economic recovery, according to a September 2011 report, "Women and Men Living on the Edge: Economic Insecurity After the Great Recession," prepared by the Institute For Women’s Policy Research and funded by the Rockefeller Foundation. Economic and labor experts we talked with supported Casagrande’s claim. Male-dominated fields such as construction and manufacturing often are hit first in recessions and tend to rebound first during an economic recovery, according to Elisabeth Jacobs, a Governance Studies fellow at the Brookings Institution; Gary Burtless, a senior fellow in Economic Studies at Brookings; and Harry Holzer, a professor of Public Policy at Georgetown University. Female-dominated fields such as education, public sector jobs and retail often are hit later and rebound slower, they said. "In terms of lost jobs, men suffered worse than women and have seen a bigger drop in their employment rate," said Burtless, who contributed $750 to Obama’s campaign in 2011 but also was an adviser on aspects of labor policy to the presidential campaign of Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.). "In terms of the number of adults who are still looking for work, women’s situation looks (proportionately) a bit worse than that of men." "The recovery has progressed more slowly for women than for men, and the unemployment rate for women is indeed higher today than it was when President Obama was elected president," Jacobs said in an e-mail. But is Obama to blame? Our colleagues at PolitiFact.com addressed this issue in April after Mitt Romney’s campaign claimed women were hit hard by job losses under Obama. Their report showed that women have had a more difficult jobs recovery than men, but Obama cannot bear all the blame, just as he couldn’t take the credit if jobs were booming when he took office. Our ruling Casagrande said, "women have come through the recession worse off than men … the numbers bear that out. We went from a 7 percent unemployment rate for women when he was elected to an 8.1 percent now." Labor statistics show and some experts told us that while men took the brunt of job loss during the recession, the industries they dominate – construction and manufacturing – tend to bounce back first during economic recovery. Women often are affected much later than men during a recession, meaning they are more likely to have a slower rate of gaining employment. Casagrande’s timeframe is off slightly for the statistic she cited, and Obama can’t be held completely responsible for the slow recovery among women. We rate Casagrande’s statement Mostly True.

pomt-04594	Says when Republicans took over the state legislature in 2010, New Hampshire’s tax rate for employers was 50th in the nation, and unemployment had more than doubled under Democrats.	half-true	/new-hampshire/statements/2012/sep/21/william-obrien/nh-speaker-house-says-democrats-are-blame-high-bus/	Eyes and ears for questionable campaign claims are everywhere. Recently a New Boston reader reached out to PolitiFact New Hampshire with a campaign mailer he received from Speaker of the House Bill O’Brien R-Mont Vernon this summer. The material was one of many tools incumbents are employing in a tussle for party control of the statehouse in 2013. "When Republicans took over the legislature in 2010, we inherited a tax rate for employers that was 50th -- dead last -- in the nation," O’Brien said. "Add to that one of the most intense regulatory state government structures in the country, and it was no wonder that the unemployment rate had more than doubled since the Democrats took power four years prior." Along with this excerpt, our reader had a simple request: "Would you be willing to crunch the numbers here?" We were happy to oblige. First, we reached out to O’Brien through his campaign email and phone number, but we heard nothing back. We broke his claim into two parts, and reached out to The Tax Foundation and the New Hampshire Employment Security for some answers. The Tax Foundation, a business-backed policy group, offered some guidance for the part of the claim where O’Brien speaks about New Hampshire’s "tax rate for employers" in 2010. That year New Hampshire ranked 50th on The Tax Foundation's corporate tax index, according to economist Scott Drenkard. Every year The Tax Foundation takes an "all-encompassing" look at the entire tax system of a state, Drenkard said, breaking it into five subcategories: corporate, income, sales, unemployment insurance, and property taxes. "The word ‘rate’ is concerning to me because it’s not exactly what it looks at," Drenkard said. "The rate is only part of this story." Drenkard pointed us to a New Hampshire Watch Dog article that broke down the Tax Foundation’s ranking at the time. As part of the study, New Hampshire ranked 7th best for overall business tax climate, and had been 7th since 2007. In 2006, the Granite State was 6th. "New Hampshire’s economic competitiveness was dragged down in the rankings by its worst in the nation corporate tax policy," according to the article. "The rate is fairly high," Drenkard said. "That's part of the component there. There's a business profits tax and New Hampshire limits carryforwards, one of the things that's an important part of the base." New Hampshire also got "dinged" in 2010 for offering credits for creating jobs, as well as research and development credits and investment credits, which The Tax Foundation scores as negative in its corporate tax policy, Drenkard added. "Those, for the most part, mixed with the high rate, ended up putting it in 50th in 2010," Drenkard said. "In general, the spirit of what he’s trying to say is certainly true. We rank it as one of the worst corporate tax structures in the country." State legislatures write the laws that impact tax structure, Drenkard said. But it’s important to note that in 2012 -- under a Republican-controlled legislature -- the Granite State only hits 46th in its corporate tax rank compared to the rest of the country. Each Tax Foundation study is considered exclusive to the year in which it is conducted and should not be compared with previous ranks, Drenkard said. "For the most part, I don’t remember hearing any fantastic corporate tax reforms from New Hampshire at least recently," Drenkard said. "So the story is it was bad in 2010 and for the most part is still one of our lowest ranked corporate tax codes." As for the Granite State’s unemployment statistics, O’Brien is fairly accurate on the numbers by themselves. "Roughly, you could say it doubled," Annette Nielsen, an economist for New Hampshire Employment Security said. Looking at 2006 generally -- four years prior to Republicans taking over the state legislature in November 2010 -- unemployment was in the 3.4-3.7 percent range, Nielsen said. It stayed that way through May 2008, she added. In November and December that year, the recession hit, and state unemployment numbers started rising. By December 2008 the unemployment was 4.8 percent. By October 2009 it peaked at 6.7 percent and stayed that way through January 2010. Not quite the "more than doubled" number O’Brien cited, but close. New Hampshire’s increasing unemployment rate followed nationwide trends, Nielsen said. "The nation was at a much higher rate, it peaked in October at 10.1 or 10.2 percent," Nielsen said. "It followed the general trend of the nation." Are Democrats to blame for the increased unemployment figures? "Whether it could be better or worse, that's kind of a little more individual -- what people maybe feel," Nielsen said. "There are some forces that are national that have an impact. New Hampshire is not an island by itself. It’s part of the nation and there were some greater forces that were taking place at that time." Dennis Delay, an economist with the N.H. Center for Public Policy Studies, an independent nonprofit that pursues data-based research on public policy matters, agreed. Unemployment increased in New Hampshire as a result of the Great Recession, he said. "States with Republican legislatures also saw unemployment rates rise substantially after 2007, because of the worldwide financial crisis and its impact on local economies," Delay added. He provided a graph of job losses in the U.S. and compared it to New Hampshire, which shows the spike in job losses nationwide during that period of time. "The situation in New Hampshire looks similar, although New Hampshire did not lose as many jobs in percentage terms as the U.S.," Delay added. Our ruling: O’Brien said that when Republicans took over the state legislature in 2010, the state's tax rate for employers was last in the nation, and unemployment had more than doubled under Democrats. We find he generalized a 2010 tax study, zeroing in on New Hampshire’s corporate tax rate, when several other factors contribute to The Tax Foundation’s corporate tax index for New Hampshire. And he failed to mention that New Hampshire’s corporate tax rank is still in the same ballpark in 2012. O’Brien used accurate unemployment figures comparing 2006 to 2010, but the numbers have more to do with the Great Recession than with the people (or the party) running the state. O’Brien was on target with the rank and rates he cited, but there is context missing and misplaced blame. We rate his claim Half True.

pomt-01919	Says 95 percent of people caught crossing the U.S.-Mexico border said in a survey "we are coming because we’ve been promised amnesty."	half-true	/texas/statements/2014/jun/29/ted-cruz/ted-cruz-accurately-recaps-survey-result-indicatin/	People have increasingly crossed into Texas over the Rio Grande because they think Uncle Sam has open arms, U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas said the other day. Cruz, at a San Antonio press conference with fellow Republicans Texas Attorney General Greg Abbott and U.S. Rep. Michael Burgess, said a May 2014 government survey of over 200 people apprehended trying to enter the country illegally proves his point. Asked "why are you coming here?," Cruz said, "95 percent said we are coming because we’ve been promised amnesty. We are coming because if we get here, we were told that we are allowed to stay, that we will have a permiso." We wondered if most recent arrivals are citing expectations of amnesty. Record crossings Tens of thousands of people, including children mostly from Central American countries, have been crossing the border, resulting in a record number of non-Mexicans getting apprehended. Accounts have varied on why more are coming than before. For instance, a June 16, 2014, National Journal news story quoted Leslie Velez, a senior protection officer at the U.N. High Commission for Refugees, as saying its 2014 interviews of 404 children revealed many were fleeing violence and crime in their home countries. Survey says... And what was Cruz citing? By email, Cruz spokeswoman Catherine Frazier pointed out June 2014 news stories in The Washington Post and the Washington Examiner summarizing a Border Patrol survey reportedly brought to light in an undated document Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, placed into the records of the Senate Judiciary Committee at a June 2014 hearing. A copy of Grassley’s document, emailed to us by Texas Sen. John Cornyn’s office, describes May 2014 interviews of adults and children by Border Patrol officers in the agency’s Rio Grande Valley sector. By telephone, Grassley spokeswoman Beth Pellett Levine said the senator knows a whistleblower summarized the interviews, though she said that as of June 24, 2014, Homeland Security hadn’t confirmed or denied the document’s authenticity. By email, a Del Rio-based Border Patrol spokesman, Dennis Smith, declined to comment on the four-page document. According to the document, the agents interviewed 230 adults and unaccompanied children from El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala on May 28, 2014. The focus, the document says, was to "obtain a general consensus as to why" the border crossers "are migrating en masse" into the country through the Rio Grande Valley. The word "amnesty" doesn’t appear in the summary of results. Also, the document says in many cases, "the subjects mentioned more than one reason," including gang-related violence, extreme poverty, high unemployment, poor living conditions and subpar educational circumstances -- with many women mentioning domestic abuse. Still, the document says, the main reason interviewed individuals "chose this particular time to migrate" was to "take advantage of the ‘new’ U.S. ‘law’ that grants a ‘free pass’ or permit (referred to as ‘permisos’) being issued by the U.S. government to female adult" non-Mexicans "traveling with minors and to" unaccompanied children." The document says the issue of "permisos" was the "main reason provided by 95% (+/-) of the interviewed subjects." The document doesn’t confirm any new law and we’re unaware of any. Confusingly, too, the document says the permisos are "Notice to Appear" documents, but it also says those documents aren’t free passes to stay in the country. Rather, the document says, the notices are routinely issued to undocumented entrants "when they are released on their own recognizance pending a hearing before an immigration judge." The document goes on to say the granting of permisos "is apparently common knowledge in Central America and is spread by word of mouth, and international and local media. A high percentage of the subjects interviewed stated their family members in the U.S. urged them to travel immediately, because the United States government was only issuing ‘permisos’ until the end of June 2014," while several people said they’d heard they’d be issued only through May 2014, the document says. Most unaccompanied children, the document says, stated they were going to join a parent or parents or other family members already in the country. The children "stated they wanted to take advantage of the ‘permiso’ being issued by the U.S. government to minors traveling alone." Many children cited high crime in their countries and forced recruitment into gangs, the document says, with others mentioning educational opportunities in the U.S. Outside lawyers: ‘It’s not amnesty’ To our telephone inquiries, immigration lawyers who looked over the Grassley-publicized document offered different interpretations of the references to permisos. Each one also said it would be inaccurate to interpret the permisos as amnesty, as in passes to remain in the country without risk of being deported or other penalties. Elizabeth Lee Young of the University of Arkansas School of Law, who emailed us a "Notice to Appear" document, characterized it as an immigration court summons. "Most of the people know it’s a notice to go to court," Young said. Anyone who doesn’t show up for their court date, she said, is subject to immediate deportation. Significantly, Young said, no one caught after crossing is given a work permit, which is how she said she usually interprets "permiso." Detainees given a notice near the border, the lawyers told us, can then be held in a government facility or released deeper into the country on personal recognizance -- as children and women with children often are, the lawyers said. Toni Maschler, a Washington, D.C., attorney, said generally, she considers a permiso a permit, like a driver’s license, and not the notice to appear for an immigration hearing. Maschler speculated the document’s references to permisos were really to the document that releases someone on their own recognizance. Lisa Brodyaga, a lawyer in San Benito, close to the Texas-Mexico border, similarly said the document’s references to permisos probably mean paperwork related to releases on personal recognizance, which she said clear the way for women and unaccompanied children to leave the border region; men, for the most part, she said, are kept in detention. Each release "allows you to get out of detention, allows you to travel, it allows you to go be with your family," Brodyaga said, "and, as long as you go to your hearings when you have them, it allows you to stay in the United States. It’s a ‘permit,’ until you get deported." "It’s nowhere near amnesty," Brodyaga said, which would mean "you are forgiven for something. You’re not forgiven. You’re subject to the laws of the United States… This does not entitle them to remain indefinitely." Similarly, Maschler said the release on personal recognizance is "not amnesty. It doesn’t give anybody a permanent right to stay in the United States." Young said: "Amnesty would indicate some form of legal waiver of your undocumented presence or entry. That is not the situation." Apprised of the lawyers’ assessments, Cruz’s spokeswoman said by email Cruz didn’t say that any legal papers deliver amnesty to border crossers. The point is people are coming because they think they’ll be allowed to stay, as they have been, Frazier said. Our ruling Cruz said a survey indicates 95 percent of people caught crossing the U.S.-Mexico border said "we are coming because we’ve been promised amnesty." This statement accurately recaps a statistic in a document made public by another senator: 95 percent of 230 adults and unaccompanied children interviewed recently by the Border Patrol gave as the main reason for their journeys the U.S. government issuing permisos, which the document defines as notices to appear in immigration court enabling recipients to stay in the country at least until then. But that’s not "amnesty," as in an absolution enabling people to stay indefinitely without risk of penalty, and indeed "amnesty" goes unmentioned in the survey summary. Also, as unsaid by Cruz, the immigrants listed other reasons for coming, including crime and violence in home countries. The document, with its anonymous origins, doesn’t specify how many individuals singled out these other factors. Another study, in which the United Nations earlier surveyed twice as many immigrants, pointed to gang violence as the vital factor.

That's illegal."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2007/dec/19/hillary-clinton/if-shes-right-bills-a-criminal/	During a campaign stop at a supermarket in Des Moines, Iowa, Hillary Clinton was asked by a shopper to autograph a dollar bill. She refused. "I can't sign money. That's illegal," Clinton said, according to a CBS News video of the exchange. "I'm so sorry." The shopper then showed reporters the dollar, which had apparently been autographed by Clinton's husband. "Well," the shopper said, "Bill signed it." So let's explore whether Sen. Clinton is correct, which would implicate her husband in a federal crime. In fact, the Treasury Department says "defacement of currency" is against the law. The law specifies that "whoever mutilates, cuts, disfigures, perforates, unites or cements together, or does any other thing to any bank bill, draft, note, or other evidence of debt issued by any national banking association, Federal Reserve Bank, or Federal Reserve System, with intent to render such item(s) unfit to be reissued, shall be fined not more than $100 or imprisoned not more than six months, or both." But if Bill is busted for violating Title 18, Section 333, then the feds will also have to prosecute some other prominent law-breakers, including treasury secretaries who have routinely autographed dollar bills, which are printed with their signatures. Like so many laws, this one becomes a matter of interpretation. In this case, it's a question of whether an autograph is a deliberate attempt to deface a bill so it can't be used again. The Treasury Department doesn't think so and says autographing dollar bills is permitted. A department fact sheet says, "Throughout the years, the Secretary of the Treasury and the Treasurer of the United States have autographed currency notes bearing their signatures at the request of private citizens. This practice is not considered as defacement since the autographs are generally provided to persons as keepsakes as opposed to circulating currency." Claudia Dickens, a spokeswoman for the Bureau of Engraving and Printing, said it only becomes a violation when it is mutilated so much that it is" unacceptable to a merchant or vending machine. That's defacing." She said autographing "is certainly not something that the Department of Treasury encourages, but it's not disallowed." And so we find that although Clinton's statement has a germ of truth because defacing dollars is illegal, she is wrong about an innocent autograph. She could have signed that buck without fear of prosecution. We find her statement Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.	None	Hillary Clinton	None	None	None	2007-12-19T00:00:00	2007-12-18	['None']

pomt-04279	Says during George W. Bush’s administration "we were losing millions of jobs per month," while under Barack Obama we have "three years of gaining hundreds of thousands of jobs per month."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/nov/02/michael-moore/michael-moore-said-us-lost-millions-jobs-month-und/	On the day of the final release of jobs numbers before the presidential election, liberal filmmaker Michael Moore tweeted a comparison of how the job market has fared under President Barack Obama and his predecessor, President George W. Bush. "Under Bush we were LOSING MILLIONS of jobs per month; under Obama we have 3 yrs of gaining hundreds of thousands of jobs per mo," Moore tweeted to his 1.2 million followers. Were Moore’s figures correct? No -- in fact, Moore conceded so himself when he sent a corrected tweet about five hours later. Let's look at the numbers. Job losses under Bush We turned to data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the government’s official collector of employment numbers. Since Moore didn’t specify what types of jobs he was referring to, we took the most basic measure -- private sector jobs combined with government jobs, not counting farm jobs or the military. During Bush’s final year -- the year with the heaviest job losses during his tenure -- the monthly net change in jobs bottomed out in the fourth quarter. Between October 2008 and November 2008, the economy shed 803,000 jobs. Between November 2008 and December 2008, the economy lost 661,000 jobs. And between January 2009 and December 2008, the economy lost 818,000 -- the highest number of Bush’s tenure (and higher than any monthly loss under Obama). That’s a huge number, but it’s not "MILLIONS." In fact, it’s not even 1 million. So Moore’s tweet exaggerated the size of the losses under Bush. Job gains under Obama The job picture did eventually improve under Obama, but Moore exaggerates when he says the economy has been gaining hundreds of thousands of jobs per month for the last three years under Obama. During 2010, the job market expanded by an average of 85,000 per month. In 2011, the average rose to 153,000 per month. And in 2012, the average rose again, to 157,000 per month. Those numbers are a whole lot better than what the nation experienced in 2008, but these rises don’t qualify as "hundreds of thousands," which we would define as at least 200,000. What about increases above 200,000 during individual months? Looking at the 34 months since January 2010, the net increase has exceeded 200,000 jobs a total of 10 times, or less than one-third of the time. And several of those were months where the job numbers were boosted only temporarily due to a flurry of hiring for the once-a-decade U.S. Census. Moore's correction About five hours after Moore's original tweet was posted, and after we had contacted his office, he sent a tweet correcting the record. "Thx for tweets on job loss - worst month w/Bush was 800K+ jobs lost, most months since '10 have had 100K+ jobs gained http://mmflint.me/QbEkPM." Moore's second tweet was correct. Our ruling Moore's initial tweet was incorrect when it said the nation was "losing millions" of jobs per month under Bush, since even the weakest month under Bush saw the economy lose less than 1 million jobs per month. And he was also incorrect to say that the economy has been "gaining hundreds of thousands of jobs" per month for three years under Obama. The economy has averaged well under 200,000 jobs per month during that period and only exceeded the job-gain threshold of 200,000 in 10 months. We applaud his correction, but we still rate his initial tweet False.	None	Michael Moore	None	None	None	2012-11-02T16:49:39	2012-11-02	['Barack_Obama', 'George_W._Bush']

pomt-14527	Travis County residents "trusted me to take on Tom DeLay — and we won."	mostly false	/texas/statements/2016/feb/17/gary-cobb/gary-cobb-won-guilty-jury-verdicts-against-tom-del/	It’s no secret: A Democratic candidate for Travis County district attorney starred in the high-profile prosecution of a felled U.S. House majority leader found guilty of campaign finance violations. A May 2015 Austin American-Statesman news story summed up: "Travis County prosecutor Gary Cobb persuaded jurors in 2010 that former U.S. House Majority Leader Tom DeLay had illegally channeled corporate funds to Texas candidates." Still, an adviser to one of Cobb’s opponents in the March 2016 primary asked us to gauge a TV ad posted on Cobb’s campaign website. In the spot, Cobb faces the camera and says: "You trusted me to take on Tom DeLay — and we won." By email, Jeff Crosby, an adviser to candidate Margaret Moore, noted that while a local jury found DeLay guilty, his convictions were thrown out on appeal. We asked Katie Naranjo, a consultant to Cobb’s campaign, about Cobb’s victory statement. By email, Naranjo told us Cobb "was entrusted as lead trial lawyer" in DeLay’s trial "and Gary (and his trial team, other attorneys, investigators and support staff—that is, ‘we’) won the trial." Naranjo acknowledged the convictions were overturned. Still, she wrote, "Gary was not the appellate lawyer, which was another team. Trial lawyers often win a trial, and then that result might get overturned on appeal. That doesn’t mean that the trial lawyers didn’t win the trial." News accounts Let’s revisit the DeLay turning points as depicted in Statesman news stories, starting with the trial. In November 2010, eight years after the county launched its investigation, a jury found DeLay, then 63, guilty of laundering corporate money into political donations during the 2002 elections. His indictment on the charges earlier led him to give up the leadership post; next, he left the House. From the Statesman account of the verdict: DeLay, a Republican whose nickname was "The Hammer" because of his heavy-handed leadership style, was accused of conspiring to funnel $190,000 of corporate money through the Republican National Committee, which sent $190,000 in campaign donations to seven GOP candidates for the Texas House. Prosecutors argued that DeLay conspired to launder corporate money into political donations as the first step in creating a GOP majority in the Texas House. It later redrew the state's congressional districts to favor Republicans, which prosecutors said bolstered DeLay's hold on his leadership post in Washington. State law prohibits corporations from giving donations to candidates directly or indirectly. Prosecutors earlier said they thought the DeLay case is the first such criminal charge ever filed over the state's century-old law on corporate contributions in state political races. In January 2011, DeLay was sentenced to three years in prison. But he also was released on a $10,000 bond pending appeals avowed by his lead trial lawyer, Dick DeGuerin. Cobb's role Cobb appears to have led the county’s courtroom team. A web search led us to a 2011 commentary by Rob Kepple of the Texas District & County Attorneys Association stating Cobb was part of a "seasoned team" of prosecutors in DeLay’s trial including Beverly Mathews, Steven Brand and Holly Taylor. Separately to our inquiry, the Travis County district attorney, Rosemary Lehmberg, said Cobb was the county’s lead counsel in the trial. Lehmberg said: "He was not as active in the appeals process," specifying that Taylor steered that task. Appeals courts On Sept. 19, 2013, the state’s 3rd Court of Appeals sided with DeLay and overturned the convictions won by Cobb. In a 2-1 ruling that broke along party lines, the judges said the prosecution had failed to prove "proceeds of criminal activity." It further noted that the jury on two occasions had asked trial Judge Pat Priest whether the $190,000 was "illegal at the start of the transaction" or "procured by illegal means originally." And, the court said, prosecutors didn’t prove that point — a critical element to conspiring to launder money — and the judge never answered the jurors’ questions. More than a year passed. But on Oct. 1, 2014, the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals, splitting 8-1 along party lines, upheld the lower court. DeLay’s political committee could legally donate corporate money to the Republican National Committee and the national organization could legally make political donations to Texas candidates, the court found, and the agreement to swap money didn’t constitute conspiracy -- and DeLay didn’t "knowingly" violate the law. District attorney comments At the time, Lehmberg said in a written statement the court had effectively repealed the state law prohibiting corporate donations to candidates and placed an impossible burden on the state to prosecute violators of the ban. "The decision undermines the fairness and integrity of our elections," she said. For this fact check, we asked Lehmberg if Travis County "won" against DeLay. She credited Cobb with winning at trial. But, she said by phone, "ultimately, we didn’t" prevail. Our ruling Cobb says Travis County residents "trusted me to take on Tom DeLay--and we won." Cobb and the county won a jury verdict against DeLay. However, the convictions were tossed by an appeals court; its ruling was upheld by the state's highest criminal court of appeals. We rate Cobb's claim Mostly False. MOSTLY FALSE – The statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression.

pomt-10929	Says he’s "never voted ‘present’ in the House instead of taking a yes or no position.	true	/texas/statements/2018/jul/26/roger-williams/roger-williams-says-hes-never-voted-present-us-hou/	U.S. Rep. Roger Williams, who represents the 25th Congressional District running north and west from Austin to just south of Tarrant County, declared that he always commits to a position on issues before the House--never voting "present" the "chicken way." A reader asked us to fact-check Williams's tout. Williams, a former Texas secretary of state who faces Democratic nominee Julie Oliver on the November 2018 ballot, was asked by Maria Bartiromo, who hosts the Fox Business Network’s "Mornings with Maria," why some Democratic colleagues had voted "present" instead of "yes" or "no" on a House-approved resolution. The measure expressed support for officers who carry out the mission of Immigration & Customs Enforcement, the agency that some Democrats lately say should be disbanded. The House vote on the resolution was 244-35 with 18 Democrats joining Republicans favoring the proposal and 34 voting against it, The Hill reported--with another 133 Democrats voting "present" as urged by Democratic leaders. The leadership "strategy was aimed at both protecting vulnerable Democrats from a contentious vote," The Hill said, "and protesting what most Democrats deemed a political stunt designed to distract the media and the public from Congress’s failure to enact immigration reforms, including efforts to address the separation of migrant families on the U.S.-Mexico border," its story said. The morning after the House action, Bartiromo asked Williams: "How do you justify voting ‘present?’" Williams replied: "Well, I never voted ‘present.’ So I don’t know that I can justify it. It’s the chicken way out is the only way I know we can put it." Checking vote histories We didn’t divine a way to plumb a government website to determine if Williams, who joined the House in 2013, had never voted "present." But to our inquiry, Joshua Tauberer, founder of GovTrack.us, a site that compiles congressional votes, confirmed Williams’s statement. Tauberer said by email that Williams, who as of late July 2018 had been eligible to vote in 3,604 roll-call votes, "has never voted ‘present,’ except in quorum calls where ‘present’ is the only vote one can make." Tauberer told us he reached his conclusion by querying the site’s internal database of votes, which he described as built in part from member votes posted by the House clerk. We were curious too about other Texas members voting "present." On that front, Tauberer emailed us a spreadsheet showing more than 1,900 "present" votes by Texans since 1990, though most weren’t substantive, we found. We sifted the provided information to find that 26 Texas members, from both parties, accounted for more than 680 non-procedural votes of "present" since 1990 with Rep. Eddie Bernice Johnson, D-Dallas, leading the delegation with 84 votes of "present" followed by Democratic Rep. Gene Green of Houston, with 61. According to our sort, Republican Rep. Joe Barton of Ennis placed third with 59 "present" votes; he was trailed by GOP Reps. Sam Johnson of Plano and Lamar Smith of San Antonio, with 57 "present" votes each, and Democratic Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee of Houston, who voted "present" 50 times. We sifted the information even more to find that since Williams joined the House in 2013, 11 House Democrats had voted "present" 20 times across nine issues -- topped by Rep. Joaquin Castro, D-San Antonio, doing so five times. Most recently, the results show, Reps. Green and Vicente Gonzalez of McAllen each voted "present" on the ICE resolution that Williams supported. Since 2013, the information indicates, no Texas Republicans in the House voted "present" on non-procedural issues. Outside analyst Finally, we asked an expert on Congress generally about the prevalence and significance of "present" votes. Steven Smith, a Washington University political scientist, said by email that party strategy or an individual’s political calculation often underlie the semi-rare "present" votes. "At times, a legislator may want to avoid committing to the ‘yea’ or ‘nay’ position without reducing his or her rate of voting participation," Smith wrote. "The legislator will be counted as having voted but without having committed to either side. This probably can be rationalized as having unacceptable alternatives, but it avoids adding a vote for or against a cause, group or constituency," Smith said. Our ruling Williams said he’s never voted "present" instead of taking a position on issues before the House. That’s backed up by research we elicited from the founder of the GovTrack.us website. We rate this claim True. TRUE – The statement is accurate and there’s nothing significant missing. Click here for more on the six PolitiFact ratings and how we select facts to check.

pomt-13924	Austin was the "site of the first mass shooting in the country."	false	/texas/statements/2016/jun/23/steve-adler/steve-adler-wrong-first-us-mass-shooting-occurred-/	Austin’s mayor struck a grim historical note when asked if he could help people understand the June 2016 shooting rampage that took 49 lives in a gay club in Orlando. "For me it’s beyond understanding," Steve Adler replied on KOKE-FM’s morning program a couple of days after the carnage. "It’s the kind of thing that could happen anywhere, though. You know," Adler said, "Austin was ... the site of the first mass shooting in the country, from that tower, that was the very first one." Adler was referring to the Aug. 1, 1966, acts of University of Texas student Charles Whitman, whose shots from atop UT’s iconic Main Building ultimately took 14 lives, wounding 31; he’d earlier stabbed to death his wife and mother. Whitman’s fusillade ended when he was shot and killed at short range. KOKE host Bob Cole followed up, asking Adler if he was saying Whitman represented "the first mass shooting in our country." "That’s what I’m told," Adler replied. "First one." No doubt, Whitman holds broad significance. Texas author Gary Lavergne’s 1997 book, "A Sniper in the Tower: The Charles Whitman Murders," says: "With deadly efficiency, he introduced America to public mass murder, and in the process forever changed our notions of safety in open spaces." Before 1966, Lavergne wrote, "mass murder was so rare that the" criminal justice "system had no special category or documentation for it. Statistics and prosecutors had treated such criminals and their crimes in the same manner as a single murder." However, mass shootings take in far more events than Adler acknowledged, making this Austin-was-first statement incorrect. Adler spokesman concedes error Mayoral spokesman Jason Stanford owned up to error when we inquired into the basis of Adler’s statement. By email, Stanford said he’d given the mayor the "first mass shooting" conclusion based on what he’d personally heard since moving to Austin in the 1990s. Next, we looked at news stories fetched from electronic archives, finding that the Austin American-Statesman didn’t deem Whitman the nation’s first mass shooter, at least in recent decades. Rather, a July 1991 American-Statesman news story called the day’s events "one of the worst mass killings in American history." Later in 1991, the Associated Press recapped the death of Richard Speck, who "shocked the nation in 1966 by stabbing and strangling eight student nurses" in a night. That story quoted James Alan Fox, then dean of Northeastern University’s College of Criminal Justice, saying the Speck slayings marked the start of America's "age of mass murder. Mass murder was not something that was in our vocabulary until Richard Speck," Fox said. Whitman, the story noted, fired from the UT Tower two weeks after the Speck murders. Defining mass shootings That story's mention of Fox prompted us to seek the professor’s analysis of Adler’s statement. By phone, Fox reminded us that a mass shooting has conventionally been defined as one involving four or more deaths by gunfire, not counting military operations or shoot-outs connected to gang activity or other crimes, all in the same one-day period--a definition he sticks with, he said, for the sake of comparisons over time. That definition is in keeping with a 2008 FBI report stating that over the previous three decades, a mass murder was defined as four or more murders occurring during the same incident, with no distinctive time period between the murders--though later, a 2012 law set the federal threshold for a "mass killing" as three or more people killed, we noted in a January 2016 fact check. Yet there’s room for other definitions and a narrower term. By email, Fox noted a Stanford University database of U.S. mass shootings launched after the 2012 Sandy Hook shootings. The Stanford project advises: "Instead of limiting our data collection to incidents in which four or more fatalities occurred (the previous FBI definition for mass murder), we instead collect incidents of three or more shooting victims (not necessarily fatalities). All mass shooting definitions are arbitrary in that there is no natural way to quantify such an event." In June 2016, Stanford’s database, which chronologically starts with the Whitman shootings, listed more than 300 incidents fulfilling its "mass shooting" definition, most recently an April 2016 drive-by incident in Missouri that left four people injured. Mass public shootings To our inquiries, Fox and Grant Duwe, author of a book on mass murder in the U.S. and director of research and evaluation for the Minnesota Department of Corrections, each noted another term with a slightly different definition--"mass public shootings." A 2013 Congressional Research Service report defined such shootings as "incidents occurring in relatively public places, involving four or more deaths—not including the shooter(s)—and gunmen who select victims somewhat indiscriminately." Whitman, Fox suggested to us, accounted for the first mass public shooting on a college campus and the largest to that time. A memorable previous public mass shooting, Fox said, occurred in September 1949 when Howard Unruh shot and killed 13 people, including three children, in a 20-minute stroll through his neighborhood in Camden, N.J., according to Unruh’s October 2009 obituary in the New York Times. Duwe said in an October 2014 article in Reason that he’d identified 161 U.S. mass public shootings since 1900, "which I've defined as incidents that occur in the absence of other criminal activity (e.g., robberies, drug deals, gang ‘turf wars,’ et cetera) in which a gun was used to kill four or more victims at a public location within a 24-hour period." And from 1900 until Whitman acted, Duwe told us by phone, there were 30 U.S. public mass shootings. His break-out, provided by email, showed pre-Whitman mass public shootings in 20 states--all but two resulting in less than 10 deaths. "Even though they didn’t match the number of victims killed or wounded in the UT-Austin shooting," Duwe said, "they certainly qualify as mass public shootings." According to the compilation, two pre-Whitman shooters caused more than a dozen deaths: Unruh and Frank Gonzalez, a California man who shot pilots on a passenger plane in May 1964; 43 people perished. A caution Generally, Fox and Duwe each cautioned against getting bogged down in assessments of first or worst mass shootings partly because, due to the limits of the commonly accepted definition, incidents such as the Saint Valentine’s Day and Wounded Knee massacres get parsed out. "This whole thing of what’s the largest," Fox said, "is really an absurd exercise as if any of these episodes would be any less tragic if wasn’t the largest." Whitman, he added, "certainly did for many many years embody what Americans thought of when they heard mass murder." Our ruling Adler said Austin was the "site of the first mass shooting in the country." The UT tragedy appears to have been the nation’s first mass public shooting on a college campus. But there were 30 mass shootings--mass murders of four or more individuals in a 24-hour period--just in the 60-plus years before Whitman acted. We rate the statement False.

pomt-05299	Says New Jersey’s prison system is "61 percent African-American even though our state is just 13 percent black."	true	/new-jersey/statements/2012/may/21/cory-booker/cory-booker-said-black-people-represent-more-60-pe/	If the United States wants to secure a future as a leading democracy, it must invest in its children, according to Newark Mayor Cory Booker. But right now the country is failing to live up to its potential, Booker said in a speech at a May 4 forum held by the American Federation for Children, a group that advocates for school choice. At the end of his speech, Booker, talking about "the carnage that happens when we fail to live up to the promise of this nation," told a story about the death of a boy he knew when he first took office in 2006. While recounting that story, Booker stopped himself and said: "I know the data. I see what's happening to young minority men in this country. I see how much, when looking from a financial perspective how much we as taxpayers pay, billions of dollars in New Jersey for a prison system or correctional system that doesn't correct. Recycling the same people over and over and over again. A prison system that is 61 percent African-American even though our state is just 13 percent black." PolitiFact New Jersey checked Booker’s statistics on the state’s prison population and found that he knows the data well. New Jersey housed 23,810 people in all of its correctional facilities, including halfway houses and county jails, as of Jan. 3, according to data from the state department of corrections. Of those nearly 24,000 offenders, 61 percent, or 14,469 people, are black. By comparison, 22 percent, or 5,300 inmates, are white and 16 percent, or 3,785 inmates, are Hispanic. New Jersey’s prison population, excluding offenders held in a facility for women and another facility for adult male sex offenders, is smaller, with 15,407 inmates. Of that population, 62 percent are black. How does the racial makeup of the state’s prison population compare with the state’s overall population? According to the U.S. Census Bureau, 13.7 percent of New Jersey’s population is black. So Booker’s numbers are right. But we wondered how New Jersey compares with the rest of the nation. Based on estimates from the U.S. Bureau of Justice Statistics, the statistical arm of the U.S. Department of Justice, nearly 38 percent of prisoners under state and federal jurisdiction at the end of 2010 were black. According to the same data, about 32 percent of prisoners were white and more than 22 percent were Hispanic. The Bureau of Justice Statistics estimates are based on prisoners with a sentence of more than one year. Overall, 12.6 percent of the U.S. population is black, according to 2010 census data. John M. Paitakes, professor of criminal justice at Seton Hall University, said there are many factors behind these statistics, citing prior records and legal representation. He also noted that profiling and prejudice could be factors, but said, "I don’t think it’s any more in New Jersey than in other areas." "I think before you draw any conclusions you have to look at all those factors to get a realistic picture of what it is," he said. Our ruling Booker said New Jersey’s prison system is "61 percent African-American even though our state is just 13 percent black." Data from the state corrections department and U.S. Census Bureau back his statistics. We rate the claim True. To comment on this story, go to NJ.com.

Here’s what the GOP has to say about Mahlon Mitchell, head of the statewide firefighters union: "Mitchell received a massive raise on the backs of hard-working firefighters and turned the union into his own personal political slush fund." So, it’s a double shot. Let’s look at both parts of the claim -- the "massive raise" and the "personal political slush fund." Compensation increase When asked for evidence to back up this part of the statement, state GOP communications director Alec Zimmerman referred PolitiFact Wisconsin to a Jan. 22, 2018, piece by watchdog columnist Dan Bice in the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel. The online headline: "Firefighter leader Mahlon Mitchell would take pay cut if elected governor." The piece noted that Mitchell was named president of the state firefighters group early in 2011 in the wake of a scandal in which top union officials were filing fraudulent expense reports. Specifically, Zimmerman cited this paragraph: Since taking the union's helm, Mitchell has seen his pay jump from $54,500 in 2011 to $90,600 in 2016 (plus another $6,787 in other income) — a 66% bump, according to federal Department of Labor filings. His predecessor made about half what Mitchell does. PolitiFact Wisconsin checked the firefighter union’s Department of Labor filings for 2017 and found there had been another increase. Those filings show Mitchell’s 2017 union compensation at $70,922, plus $31,727 for disbursements for official business and an additional $12,431 for other disbursements for a total of $115,080. So, Mitchell’s overall union compensation went from $97,387 in 2016 to $115,080 in 2017, an increase of about 18 percent. When compared to $54,500 when he began in 2011, his union compensation has increased to $115,080 in 2017, or about 111 percent over six years. While there is no official definition for a "massive pay raise," Mitchell’s union compensation increase of 111 percent from 2011 to 2017 compares to an 18.3 percent increase in base pay for an entry level Madison firefighter during that same period. According to the City of Madison Fire Department website, an entry level firefighter is currently paid $50,204.70. In 2011, an entry level firefighter salary was $42,449.16. "Since he’s working at a Union funded by the dues of firefighters, it’s accurate to say that his raises were funded by their contributions," said Zimmerman. Still, framing it as on the "backs of hard-working firefighters" goes a little too far in that it portrays it as something imposed on union members. Steve Wilding, secretary/treasurer of the state firefighters union, told the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel in January 2018 that salaries and per-diems for the union's brass are voted on by the nearly 200 delegates at the group's annual convention. (Note: Mitchell’s pay from the City of Madison is not included in this discussion because the state GOP allegations are specifically addressing compensation from "hard-working firefighters" not city taxpayers.) Political spending On the "political slush fund" part of the claim, Zimmerman provided spreadsheets that showed, in his words, that the union’s political spending under Mitchell shifted to "being overwhelmingly supportive of liberal causes while he was at the helm, including over $40,000 to Mahlon’s campaigns." We turned to Follow The Money, a website that is part of the National Institute on Money in Politics, which compiles campaign-donor, lobbyist, and other information from government agencies nationwide. The site shows that the Wisconsin Professional Fire Fighters of Wisconsin has made an overwhelming majority of its contributions to Democratic candidates over the years, including Gov. Jim Doyle, Mary P. Burke and yes, Mahlon Mitchell, who in 2012 unsuccessfully ran for the office of lieutenant governor in a recall election against Rebecca Kleefisch. The union has also contributed to GOP candidates, such as Scott Walker and Brad Schimel, though the amount of the donations to the Republican candidates have fallen far short of the donations to Democrats. According to the Journal Sentinel January article, since 2011 to that point, the firefighter union's political action fund had donated a total of $129,250 to state candidates and PACs, with 98% of the cash going to Democrats. Also, during Mitchell's 2012 lieutenant governor's bid, the firefighters PAC gave $3,500 to his campaign and the union itself donated $40,000 to an outside group backing Mitchell with independent expenditures, the Journal Sentinel reported in the January article. Mitchell had no role, officials said, in the spending of these union funds, having recused himself on the matter. In the current campaign, a U.S. Department of Labor website listing shows the union contributed $25,000 to Mahlon Mitchell for Wisconsin on Nov. 13, 2017, and $15,444 on Nov. 30, 2017, for a total of $40,444. But what of the "slush fund" characterisation? The Merriam-Webster dictionary defines "slush fund" as "a fund for bribing public officials or carrying on corruptive propaganda; an unregulated fund often used for illicit purposes." While there is plenty of hyperbole in politics, in our view this goes too far. For instance, there are no allegations that contribution limits were ignored or any campaign finance laws broken. What’s more, there is no evidence that Mitchell alone decides where the union contributions go. In January, when the state GOP first made the "slush fund" allegation, Wilding -- the union secretary/treasurer -- told the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel that the union’s bylaws and constitution prevent individuals from enriching themselves at the expense of other members. In an Aug. 8 Journal Sentinel article, Wilding noted to columnist Dan Bice that Mitchell’s base compensation dropped from some $90,000 in 2016 to $70,000 in 2017. Wilding said top union officials are paid a small salary and a payment for services performed for the organization on a day-by-day basis. Meanwhile, Mitchell’s campaign communications director Kirsten Allen responded with a general slam on Walker. Allen did not provide a response when asked in a series of emails and telephone calls to address the specific issues that are part of this factcheck. Our rating The state GOP says Mitchell "received a massive raise on the backs of hard-working firefighters and turned the union into his own personal political slush fund." The union members did OK the compensation increase, so saying it was "on the backs" of firefighters goes too far. But Mitchell’s 111 percent increase over a period of about six years is a major one. So the GOP has a point on that part of the claim. Meanwhile, the union’s political contributions have shifted to Democrats, including more than $40,000 to Mitchell’s current campaign. But the GOP provided no evidence Mitchell solely decides where the political contributions go. Indeed, the union says he recuses himself from any discussions. Even with an allowance for the hyperbole of campaign season, the "slush fund" characterization goes too far.

pomt-02955	For the state of Florida, "there is not an additional cost with implementation of the Common Core standards."	half-true	/florida/statements/2013/oct/26/pam-stewart/state-education-chief-says-theres-no-additional-co/	One of the many complaints about Florida’s move toward new school standards has centered on its cost. "Based on data from several sources, the Common Core standards and accompanying tests will be very expensive – both to implement and to maintain," the Florida Stop Common Core Coalition argues on its website. At a recent public hearing on the standards, Florida education commissioner Pam Stewart challenged the criticism of the K-12 English and math standards. "Our analysis is there is not an additional cost with implementation of the Common Core standards," Stewart said. Her assertion brought out the doubters, even among Common Core supporters. PolitiFact Florida decided to take a closer look. The issue isn’t as clear cut as you might imagine. Most policy analysts watching Common Core agree that its implementation carries expenses. The National Conference of State Legislatures offers a sample list of what to expect: one-time transition costs such as new instructional materials, tests, technology and teacher training, and ongoing maintenance and updates. "When taking into account all of the things that need to be updated and the fact that it’s difficult for state education agencies to change their practice (move away from ‘business as usual’), I think it will be extremely challenging to keep costs flat," said Anne Hyslop, an education analyst for the New America Foundation. Indeed, the Florida Department of Education created a spreadsheet in February detailing more than $100 million in Common Core projects the state had embarked upon. The items included $24 million for the creation of student tutorial lessons, $4.7 million to generate math assessments and lesson study toolkits, and $25.5 million for a database of test questions for teachers to use. Funding for the vast majority of these projects came from a federal Race to the Top grant that Florida won, in part, for agreeing to adopt the Common Core. During the spring 2013 legislative session, Florida lawmakers noted that testing for the new standards would require computers, and they adopted a law barring the state from using Common Core-affiliated tests until all schools had the needed technology in place. The bill analysis noted that the State Board of Education requested $442 million for the improvements, a number later revised downward to $100 million. So the Common Core price tag is well documented. But that doesn’t make Stewart completely wrong. "It costs something," said Patrick Murphy, research director for the Public Policy Institute of California. "The question is, does it cost extra money than we were going to spend?" Murphy noted Stewart’s use of the word "additional," and said that makes all the difference. "It is not impossible to conceive of a scenario where existing funds that may have been slated for, say, ‘general’ professional development will be used to focus on the (Common Core). If I was running a school district, that is what I would do," he said. In a paper for the Thomas B. Fordham Institute titled "Putting a Price Tag on the Common Core," Murphy and colleagues put forth three models under which states might implement Common Core -- "Bare Bones," "Business as Usual" and "Balanced." In two of the three possibilities, the group projected Florida to carry millions in added costs. Florida Department of Education officials did not have any reports that separated costs out in such a way. State officials noted, though, that adoption of the standards cost nothing, and that much of the implementation, such as training and textbook purchases, would have been funded in some form even if the state weren’t using the standards. "The purchase of materials for the new standards was embedded in our regular instructional materials purchase cycle so did not result in additional purchases or increased costs unless school districts chose to do so," DOE spokeswoman Tiffany Cowie said in an email. As another example, the state’s move to improve school technology could be attributed to a 2011 legislative mandate to have materials fully digital by 2015, or an even earlier press to transition all state testing to computers. "This process began before Florida’s standards were adopted and will continue regardless of Florida’s new standards," Cowie said. Also, Florida has paid about $30.59 per student annually for FCAT testing in recent years. It has not selected a Common Core test, so it has no estimate for the potential cost differences. "If the department chooses PARCC, no additional cost will be incurred, as the creation of the test is free to all participating PARCC states," Cowie said. "If another test is selected, there will be costs associated with the procurement of a new test." From the department’s view, then, much of the money would have been spent on similar projects anyway, with or without the new standards. Our ruling Stewart said implementation of the Common Core would not incur additional expenses. Some of the money spent on Common Core is money the state would have spent anyway on curriculum and testing. But experts said it’s unlikely that implementing the new standards cost the state no additional money. Another wrinkle: The state received a federal grant to help pay for Common Core implementation.

pomt-10231	Barack Obama supports plans to raise "income taxes ... payroll taxes."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/sep/03/sarah-palin/obamas-taxes-hit-only-higher-incomes/	Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin accepted the nomination for the vice presidency at the Republican National Convention and used her speech to attack Democratic presidential nominee Barack Obama. "Taxes are too high. He wants to raise them. His tax increases are the fine print in his economic plan, and let me be specific," Palin said on Sept. 3, 2008, in St. Paul, Minn. "The Democratic nominee for president supports plans to raise income taxes ... raise payroll taxes ... raise investment income taxes ... raise the death tax ... raise business taxes ... and increase the tax burden on the American people by hundreds of billions of dollars." Here, we'll review Obama's position on income taxes and payroll taxes. We've checked previous claims about his position on investment income taxes and estate taxes . Obama wants to roll back the Bush tax cuts on the upper-income brackets. So the claim is true if you are a family making more than $250,000 a year, or a single person making more than $200,000. Otherwise, it's generally not the case. In fact, Obama advocates eliminating income taxes for seniors with incomes less than $50,000. The payroll tax claim is a little different. Obama proposes a $1,000 tax credit on income for working families ($500 for singles), to offset payroll taxes. So for most people, Obama is actually lowering payroll taxes. But he has said he would raise payroll taxes on people making higher incomes of about $250,000 in order to keep Social Security solvent. Currently, only the first $97,500 of a person's income is taxable. So for higher incomes, Obama would raise payroll taxes. Palin is painting Obama's proposals with a broad brush and not including crucial context. Obama does intend to increase taxes. But most people have incomes of less than $200,000, and these people would not see income tax increases or payroll tax increases under Obama's plan. We rate Palin's statement Half True.

"The focus of this body will be the economy and to help the private sector create jobs," Rep. Matt Huffman, the majority floor leader, said at a news conference at the Statehouse to roll out this year’s party agenda. House Republicans proclaimed the same message last year after they reclaimed the majority in the 2010 fall election. But state Rep. Armond Budish, the minority leader in the house, would beg to differ. He asserts that House Republicans instead pushed an agenda to diminish workers’ rights, voting rights and abortion rights. "We've seen more anti-women's choice bills introduced in the first half of this session than we've seen in the last three General Assemblies," Budish said at a Jan. 31 news conference announcing his party's priorities. PolitiFact Ohio asked Budish's office for the numbers. They provided a list identifying legislation that would restrict abortion that was introduced last year and from previous General Assemblies. We checked that list ourselves, too, using the search engine for laws, acts and legislation on the legislature's website. The list, we noted, includes such measures as HB 125, prohibiting abortion as soon as a fetal heartbeat is detected, and HB 153, the state operating budget, which contained two provisions restricting access to abortion. It did not include such measures as HB 180, creating the "Massillon Tiger Football Booster Club" license plate and prohibiting any money raised by it to go to "abortion-related activities." The list showed 11 bills that would affect abortion rights from 2011, the first session of the 129th General Assembly. That’s more than any of the three previous two-year sessions. There were eight bills in 128th General Assembly, nine in the 127th and six in the 126th. We rate Budish's statement as True.	None	Armond Budish	None	None	None	2012-02-03T06:00:00	2012-01-31	['None']
pomt-09577	"Because of the steps we took, there are about 2 million Americans working right now who would otherwise be unemployed."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/jan/27/barack-obama/obama-claims-two-million-more-americans-would-be-u/	The number of jobs "saved or created" by the massive economic stimulus championed by President Barack Obama has been a matter of intense partisan disagreement all year, and no doubt the president's claims in his State of the Union address will reignite the debate. "Because of the steps we took" in the stimulus, Obama said, "there are about 2 million Americans working right now who would otherwise be unemployed." Obama's numbers come from a Jan. 13, 2010, report from the White House Council of Economic Advisers, which concluded that through the fourth quarter of 2009, the stimulus raised employment relative to what it otherwise would have been by 1.5 million to 2 million jobs. So right off the bat, the president has chosen to highlight the top end of his own advisers' projection. And it is a projection, as the CEA report acknowledges, subject to a large margin of error. "As we have emphasized, measuring what a policy action has contributed to growth and employment is inherently difficult because we do not observe what would have occurred without the policy," the report states. "Therefore, it must be understood that our estimates are subject to substantial margins of error. The results, however, are strong enough and clear enough that we are confident that the basic conclusions are solid. That a wide range of private and government analysts concur with our estimates adds a reassuring check on our analysis." Let's taker a look at some of those other private and government analyses. The Congressional Budget Office, a nonpartisan government agency regularly cited by politicians in both parties, pegged the number of jobs saved or created by the stimulus through the fourth quarter of 2009 at somewhere between 800,000 and 2.4 million. That's obviously an extremely wide range, which the CBO said was "intended to reflect the uncertainty of such estimates and to encompass most economists’ views on the effects of fiscal stimulus." Obama's number is within that range, but well toward the high end. As an aside, the CBO recently revised its projection of the cost of the stimulus, estimating that it will cost $75 billion more than originally anticipated. The new estimate is that the stimulus will increase budget deficits by $862 billion over the next decade. The CEA report notes projections from several other economic forecasters: IHS/Global Impact, which projected the number jobs saved or created by the stimulus in 2009 at 1.25 million; Macroeconomic Advisers, 1 million; and Moody's Economy.com, 1.6 million. Obama's 2 million number is rosier than all of those projections. Many Republicans have attacked the "saved or created" numbers cited by the White House as ridiculous in light of an unemployment rate hovering around 10 percent; and the loss of roughly 3 million more jobs since the stimulus was passed. "There is absolutely no evidence whatsoever that the stimulus has saved or created any jobs, let alone 2 million," said Brian Riedl, lead budget analyst for the conservative Heritage Foundation. "It's impossible to know how the economy would have performed without the stimulus," Riedl said, and he finds it "implausible" that the country would have lost 5 million jobs in 2009 (the 3 million lost plus 2 million "saved" by the stimulus) if the stimulus had not passed. "I don't know how they can back that up." It's a classic case of single-entry bookkeeping, Riedl said. The government is just shifting jobs from one part of the economy to another, he said. The $250 billion spent by the federal government surely created jobs, he said, but fails to account for pulling $250 billion borrowed by the federal government from other sectors of the economy. "That's money that would have been spent somewhere else in the economy," Riedl said. "The effect is that you are going to cancel stuff out. That's why unemployment numbers aren't dropping." For the president's numbers to be true, Riedl said, you'd have to assume those who lent the federal government the money would otherwise have stuffed that $250 billion "in a mattress or put it in a safe." However, Gus Faucher, director of macroeconomics at Moody's Economy.com, said while Riedl's argument might hold water in robust economic times, the fact is that when the government passed the stimulus, "People weren't borrowing; the demand wasn't there." The last Moody's projection was for the third quarter of last year, he said, and at that point, Moody's estimated that employment was about 1.1 million greater than it would have been without the stimulus. Faucher expects that when fourth quarter numbers are added, that number will be closer to 1.5 million. "I would say that he (Obama) is in the ballpark," Faucher said. "It may be a little high, but not ridiculously high." But, he warned, these numbers are all just economic projections. "By definition, this is an art, not a science," Faucher said. And that's our biggest issue with Obama's definitive claim that if not for the stimulus, 2 million Americans working right now would otherwise be unemployed. It's a projection. Economists can't say for sure what would have happened if the stimulus had not passed, and whether those who got jobs through the stimulus would otherwise be unemployed. And while the number cited by Obama is backed up by the projections from his Council of Economic Advisers, it's on the high side of the projections from the CBO, and significantly higher than projections from several other economic forecasters.

pomt-13176	Says Democratic U.S. Senate candidate Russ Feingold "voted over 250 times to raise taxes."	false	/wisconsin/statements/2016/oct/27/americans-prosperity/americans-prosperity-falsely-claims-250-tax-increa/	Democrat Russ Feingold spent nearly two decades in the U.S. Senate, and is now trying to win back his old seat from Republican Ron Johnson, who ousted Feingold in 2010. A recent campaign ad from Americans for Prosperity claims one theme permeated Feingold’s tenure in Washington — a push for higher taxes. The conservative political advocacy group even puts a precise number on that claim: "He voted time and again to make life more expensive for families in Wisconsin," the narrator says in the ad, released in August. "Russ voted over 250 times to raise taxes — 250." The Club for Growth, another conservative group, used the same figure in an ad released Oct. 12, 2016, wording it as "250 votes for higher taxes." Did Feingold really cast that many votes to raise taxes? The matter isn’t as straightforward as the nice round number leads viewers to believe. Disagreement over budget votes When asked for backup, Americans for Prosperity, founded by billionaire businessman and activist David Koch, provided a list of 264 votes dating back to Feingold’s 1993 debut in the U.S. Senate. We did our own research and also sent the list to Feingold’s campaign for feedback. The foundational question is what constitutes a vote to "raise taxes"? More than half the votes cited in the ad — 150 — came on budget resolutions, which set non-binding parameters for considering tax and spending legislation. They are used as blueprints for the budget or in some cases to make a political statement. But PolitiFact has noted repeatedly that it is inaccurate to suggest votes on non-binding budget resolutions are the same as votes on legislation that sets policy. The resolutions often don’t include precise details and don’t on their own raise, lower or even keep taxes the same. "You’re voting for kind of an overall map and taking multiple votes on that same map, and not directly raising or lowering taxes in a piece of legislation," said Joshua Gordon, policy director of the Concord Coalition, a group that urges deficit reduction. Americans for Prosperity contends the votes are a fair addition to the tally. "Although many of the spending and revenue levels set in budget resolutions require additional legislative action to implement, there are a number of spending and tax policies set by budget resolutions," said James Fellinger, a spokesman for the group. "Budget resolutions enact procedural changes in order to ease the passage of those policies — voting for a budget resolution is plainly supporting the policies it outlines." The ad’s tally also includes many votes that were actually against tax cuts — not in favor of tax increases. Feingold spokesman Michael Tyler said Feingold campaign counted more than 150 such examples among the votes cited by Americans for Prosperity. It’s not merely a semantic distinction. When PolitiFact Florida fact-checked a nearly identical claim about votes to raise taxes, three federal budget experts generally agreed that a vote against a new tax cut isn’t the same as a vote for a tax increase. Gordon said that element of the ad’s claim "is probably the worst argument of all of them" from a fiscal policy perspective. "The voter reading that is going to believe (Feingold) voted in 250 separate times to raise an individual’s own income tax," Gordon said. "By any standard that sort of accounting is false in terms of what we expect the average voter to take away from the (claim)." A counting question Meanwhile, there is another problem: Though Americans for Prosperity cited 264 separate votes from Feingold, they came on only 65 pieces of legislation. The votes came on amendments that varied widely in content and scope, so each represented a different position. Nevertheless, that counting approach inflates the total. For example, Feingold cast 34 votes on Senate Concurrent Resolution 23 in 2003, which established Congress’ version of the budget for the following year. Each vote took a position on a proposed change of some kind, but should that count as 34 votes or one? "Counting multiple votes on the same legislation and all of its permutations just serves to pad the number, but in some cases isn’t completely inaccurate, just not telling the full tale," Steve Ellis, vice president of Taxpayers for Common Sense, told PolitiFact Florida in 2012 when it tackled and rated a similar item. Another problem with the 250 tally: some of the votes come on nuanced, multi-part amendments that are not easily categorized. One example is the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010, companion legislation to the Affordable Care Act that helped established Obamacare. Feingold cast three votes on March 24, 2010, against amendments that would exempt certain devices from a 2.3 percent tax (in effect, voting to raise a tax). But the amendment would have offset that by lowering the law’s affordability tax exemption for individuals (voting to lower a tax). Despite the offsetting effect, Americans for Prosperity lists it as a tax increase. Our rating Americans for Prosperity says Feingold voted more than 250 times to raise taxes as a U.S. senator, contending any vote in support of a higher tax should be part of that tally. But that number is built on assumptions and simplifications. Though Feingold cast tax-related votes that many times, more than half of those came on non-binding resolutions that took a position in favor of raising taxes but did not raise taxes by themselves. The claim also does not account for the large number of votes that were actually against a tax cut, not in favor of a tax increase. Experts say that’s a big difference. And it doesn’t acknowledge the nuanced nature of the votes themselves or that many votes came on elements of the same legislation. We rate the ad’s claim False. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/8aecd592-a350-4255-97a3-e1210795a4a1	None	Americans for Prosperity	None	None	None	2016-10-27T05:00:00	2016-08-22	['Russ_Feingold']
pomt-10123	"The Democrats in the Senate and some members of Congress defended what Fannie and Freddie were doing. They resisted any change."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/oct/13/john-mccain/theres-plenty-of-bipartisan-blame-for-crisis/	In the back-and-forth campaign blame game going on over the financial crisis, Sen. John McCain pointed the finger at Democrats and Obama for failing to support a plan to exert regulatory control over Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac in 2005 and 2006. "But you know, one of the real catalysts, really the match that lit this fire was Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac," McCain said at the second presidential debate on Oct. 7. "I'll bet you, you may never even have heard of them before this crisis. But you know, they're the ones that, with the encouragement of Senator Obama and his cronies and his friends in Washington, that went out and made all these risky loans, gave them to people that could never afford to pay back. "And you know, there were some of us that stood up two years ago and said we've got to enact legislation to fix this. We've got to stop this greed and excess. "Meanwhile," McCain said, "the Democrats in the Senate and some ? and some members of Congress defended what Fannie and Freddie were doing. They resisted any change." Set up decades ago by the federal government to underwrite mortgages and promote home ownership, Fannie Mae (the Federal National Mortgage Association) and Freddie Mac (the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp.) became major players in the domestic mortgage market. They don't make loans to homeowners directly, but they purchase mortgages, bundle them into securities, and sell some of them on the open market. Together, Fannie and Freddie owned or guaranteed about $5-trillion in mortgages, about half of the U.S. market. After years of rapid growth in home prices, foreclosures and mortgage delinquencies began rising by 2006. Some homeowners had adjustable-rate mortgages that were resetting to higher rates they could no longer afford. In other cases, speculators were overextended and dumping properties. Outright fraud had some role: people who took out loans never intending to pay them back. Regardless of the reasons, by 2008 foreclosures were affecting Fannie and Freddie. The agencies didn't have enough money to meet their financial obligations, and the U.S. government took them over on Sept. 7. When McCain points an accusing finger at the Democrats for encouraging Fannie and Freddie to make too many risky loans, he's talking about the Federal Housing Enterprise Regulatory Reform Act initiated by Republican Sen. Chuck Hagel in 2005. In 2006, McCain signed on to the Republican-led attempt at regulatory overhaul of the mortgage-financing firms, which both went through multibillion-dollar accounting scandals earlier in the decade. The occasion that prompted McCain’s involvement was the release of a 340-page report from the Office of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight that concluded that Fannie Mae had manipulated earnings and violated basic accounting principles. It describes an “arrogant and unethical corporate culture” in which executives were more concerned about their bonuses than meeting the company’s housing mission. The findings, based on a 27-month investigation and resulting in a $400-million fine paid to the government, prompted McCain to join other critics and call for more scrutiny of Fannie and its sibling, Freddie Mac."If Congress does not act, American taxpayers will continue to be exposed to the enormous risk that Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac pose to the housing market, the overall financial system, and the economy as a whole," McCain declared in a May 26, 2006, news release. While McCain is quick to blame Democrats for opposing the legislation — they did — the Republicans controlled Congress at the time, and there was a Republican in the White House. Yet the bill languished in the Senate, and it wasn't until earlier this year that Congress and the Bush administration, shaken by the extent of the subprime crisis, completed a regulatory overhaul by combining OFHEO and the Federal Housing Finance Board into a new regulatory body, the Federal Housing Finance Agency. We should also note that prior to 2000, support for Fannie and Freddie was more bipartisan. In the late 1990s, the Republican-controlled Congress — with the blessing of Democratic President Bill Clinton — eased the credit requirements on loans that Fannie and Freddie purchased. "It's a bipartisan problem," said Bill Beach, director of the Center for Data Analysis at the conservative Heritage Foundation. McCain rightly notes that the 2005-2006 efforts to regulate Fannie and Freddie were Republican-led, and opposed by the Democrats, but McCain's current attempts to depict those efforts as an early warning that could have lessened the current credit crisis don't wash. McCain was talking mostly about potential fallout from accounting troubles, not freewheeling lending standards based on a housing bubble. And he said nothing about major financial institutions becoming badly leveraged on bad loans and new securities products. Even if the 2006 effort to strengthen oversight had succeeded, it’s debatable whether it would have averted the subprime crisis. The extent of the problems was not yet fully known, and it’s a leap of faith to suggest that regulators granted expanded power would have noticed a deterioration in Fannie and Freddie’s loan portfolios soon enough and would have sounded an alarm. So first, when McCain talks about this legislation, it's not the cure-all he suggests it may have been; the focus then was on corruption in Fannie and Freddie, which isn't really what the financial crisis is about. Democrats may have opposed it, but it didn't appear to have all that many champions in a Republican-controlled Senate, either. And last, if you look back in time, Democrats and Republicans supported an easing of lending standards in the late 1990s. So for McCain to lay Fannie and Freddie woes entirely at the feet of the Democrats is unfair. We rate his statement Half True.

pomt-14145	"In the history of Republican primaries, I’ve gotten the most votes in the history of the Republican party."	false	/california/statements/2016/may/02/donald-trump/donald-trumps-claim-about-receiving-most-votes-eve/	Donald Trump’s march to the GOP nomination picked up steam last week, with dominant primary victories in the northeast. After the wins, several news outlets reported that the New York billionaire could break the record for most Republican primary votes in history — if Trump scores big in Indiana, New Jersey and California. Those states have yet to vote. Trump, apparently not wanting to wait, declared he’s already achieved the voting record. "In the history of Republican primaries, I’ve gotten the most votes in the history of the Republican party," Trump said during his speech on Friday, April 29 at the California Republican Party Convention south of San Francisco. Trump went on to say he’s broken the record without needing to wait for big states like California. Was Trump right? Had he already collected the most primary votes in history? We set out on a fact check. Our research Eric Ostermeier, a political science professor at the University of Minnesota and founder of the number-crunching blog Smart Politics, has taken a look at the data. "He is on pace to break the record, but he hasn’t yet," Ostermeier told PolitiFact California. "I’ve seen no possible configuration of numbers that show he’s already broken it." Ostermeier placed Trump’s primary vote total at about 10 million so far. That’s still short of the 10.8 million votes George W. Bush received in the 2000 GOP primaries. If one counts both primaries and caucuses, Trump would still be short of Bush’s overall tally, the professor said. Bush’s total is considered closer to 12 million if both types of elections are counted, he said. Ostermeier estimated Trump would likely achieve the primary vote record if he earns a strong win in California’s primary, where he could pick up more than a million additional primary votes. He said Trump’s large vote totals can be attributed to the relatively close match-up he’s had with Cruz late into the primary season. Several news articles, including by the Washington Post and Politico, used primary vote totals logged by RealClearPolitics.com. Its data show Trump has yet to break the record. Trump’s campaign did not respond to our request for comment. Our ruling Donald Trump said he’s already earned the most Republican primary votes in history. Experts who track this say Trump is on pace to break the record, but is still shy by about 800,000 votes. They predicted a strong victory in California --- more than a month from now -- could hand Trump the milestone. We rate Trump’s claim False … for now. UPDATE: About one month after PolitiFact California rated Donald Trump’s "most votes in history" claim on April 29, 2016 as "False … for now," the vote totals have changed. Trump now appears to have broken the all-time record for most votes in a GOP presidential primary. That’s according to Eric Ostermeier, a political science professor at the University of Minnesota and founder of the number-crunching blog Smart Politics. Ostermeier told us on June 1, 2016 that Trump’s victory in the Washington primary on May 24, 2016 put him over the top. The rating on his April 29 claim remains the same because we judge statements based on the data available at the time. Trump got ahead of himself again during a speech in Sacramento, also on June 1, 2016, where he said he’s broken the GOP presidential primary record "by millions" of votes. We rated that claim "False again … for now." Ostermeier predicted Trump could smash the record by millions following the June 7 primary in California, New Jersey and other states. We'll be watching. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/082e07f8-9846-4ffa-b768-1719cae2ac47	None	Donald Trump	None	None	None	2016-05-02T17:28:29	2016-04-29	['Republican_Party_(United_States)']
pomt-14768	"If Trump had just put his father’s money in a mutual fund ... he’d have $8 billion."	false	/punditfact/statements/2015/dec/09/occupy-democrats/occupy-democrats-say-simple-investment-trumps-fath/	Donald Trump is a billionaire and he plays it up big in his bid to be president. What he did in business, he argues, he can do for the country. Republican and Democratic critics aim to shoot holes in that assumption. One tack is that Trump hasn’t been the super savvy investor he purports to be. The liberal group Occupy Democrats posted an image on its Facebook page on Dec. 2, 2015, to bring Trump down a notch or 10. Under a smiling photo of Trump, the image has these words: "Bloomberg puts Trump’s current net worth at $2.9 billion. ... If Trump had just put his father’s money in a mutual fund that tracked the S&P 500 and spent his career finger-painting, he’d have $8 billion." The source, included in the post, is Deborah Friedell with the London Review of Books. As it turns out, the graphic from Occupy Democrats did a fine job of quoting Friedell, but Friedell did a less than stellar job of quoting the source for her claim. Friedell’s words come from her review of a new biography of Donald Trump, Never Enough: Donald Trump and the Pursuit of Success by Michael D’Antonio. Here’s the full text relevant to this fact-check: "Bloomberg puts Trump’s current net worth at $2.9 billion, Forbes at $4.1 billion. The National Journal has worked out that if Trump had just put his father’s money in a mutual fund that tracked the S&P 500 and spent his career finger-painting, he’d have $8 billion." But if you read the National Journal story, it doesn’t directly tie whatever money Trump got from his father to an eventual $8 billion today. Here’s the key paragraph from a Sept. 2, 2015, article headlined "The 1 Easy Way Donald Trump Could Have Been Even Richer: Doing Nothing." "Had the celebrity busi­ness­man and Re­pub­lic­an pres­id­en­tial can­did­ate in­ves­ted his even­tu­al share of his fath­er’s real-es­tate com­pany in­to a mu­tu­al fund of S&P 500 stocks in 1974, it would be worth nearly $3 bil­lion today, thanks to the mar­ket’s per­form­ance over the past four dec­ades. If he’d in­ves­ted the $200 mil­lion that For­bes magazine de­term­ined he was worth in 1982 in­to that in­dex fund, it would have grown to more than $8 bil­lion today." There’s a bit of informed guesswork behind these numbers because outsiders can only know so much about Trump’s finances. The National Journal writer, S.V. Dáte, figured Trump started with $40 million in 1974. That’s the year he became president of his father’s real estate company. By one estimate, the firm was worth about $200 million and divided among Donald Trump and his four siblings, each would have received $40 million. But it’s not as though the company was liquidated that year. Trump’s father lived until 1999, so whatever happened, it’s more complicated than Trump receiving a cash inheritance in 1974 and deciding what he would do with it. We’re left with a question of how much money Trump got from his father and, most important, at what point those assets morphed from being his father’s to being his. In 1982, after running his father’s firm for eight years, Forbes magazine estimated Trump’s worth at $200 million. Since he was in charge of the company, then those dollars are more his than his father’s. The Journal article tiptoed around this uncertainty with careful phrasing. The author talked about Trump investing "his eventual share of his father’s real estate company." An eventual share is not cash in hand. Similarly, the article did not say that the estimated $200 million in 1982 was from Trump’s father. Dáte told us in his view, that truly was Trump's money because the real estate company was worth more than that. Dáte said he didn't really care what the status of the assets was. "I just wanted to get to the point of saying that given the amount of money he started with, to be a billionaire — it's not too hard," Dáte said. "I worded it as carefully as I did because there are a lot of uncertainties." Importantly, if the $200 million did not come from Trump's father, then you can't say that the father's money could have been worth $8 billion today. But the Occupy Democrats’ Facebook post took a paraphrase of the National Journal piece and then edited the paraphrase down to the text on the image. Occupy Democrats editor Omar Rivero didn’t defend the graphic he shared. Rivero said his group occasionally shares graphics made by others. "As you can see in the post description and in the watermark, this graphic was made by Santa Pegatina, a political graphics maker," Rivero said. The best summary of the National Journal article is that it presents a hypothetical investment scenario using numbers that have some basis in the value of the Trump holdings, but aren’t necessarily what Trump got directly from his father. Running the numbers Even if the underlying assumptions are dodgy, the math at least is in the ballpark. We used $40 million as the starting point for 1974. Honghui Chen, associate professor of finance at the University of Central Florida, told us the account would have grown to $3.94 billion by November 2015 if the money had followed the S&P 500 index and all dividends had been reinvested. This is a rough calculation that ignores taxes owed on dividends, but it’s on the same scale as what the National Journal reported. Chen said it’s trickier to calculate the value of $200 million invested in 1982. "Because the stock market in 1982 was quite volatile, the current value of $200 million investment in 1982 would depend on the time at which it was initially invested," Chen said. If it went in right at the end of 1981, it would be worth $6.7 billion. Invested in June 1982, the value today would be $8.3 billion. Invested at the end of 1982, it would be worth $9 billion. Again, in the neighborhood of what the Journal said. There is a huge debate over Trump’s current net worth. Estimates from outsiders, such as Bloomberg and Forbes, range from about $3 billion to about $4 billion. Trump says he has closer to $9 billion. Our ruling Occupy Democrats shared an image that said if Trump had taken the money he got from his father and simply put it in a fund that tracked the S&P 500, he’d have $8 billion today. While it's true that Trump got a leg up from his father on the order of many tens of millions of dollars, this specific claim suffers from a key flaw. The only way to hit the $8 billion mark is to start with $200 million in 1982, and it's wrong to say that was Trump's father's money. While the father's business put Trump on the path to have $200 million in 1982, Trump himself had been running the company for eight years. We rate this claim False.

pomt-07680	Says Florida Gov. Rick Scott’s cuts to education are the same as his proposed corporate income tax rate reduction.	mostly false	/florida/statements/2011/mar/08/alan-grayson/alan-grayson-returns-msnbc-stage-criticizes-gov-ri/	Minutes after Florida Gov. Rick Scott finished delivering his first State of the State address, a trio of Democrats took turns rebuffing the new governor on everything he just said. Senate Minority Leader Nan Rich and House Minority Leader Ron Saunders came first in brief televised remarks, attacking Scott’s plans to cut education funding and make teachers, firefighters and police officers take de facto pay cuts in order to contribute to their own retirement. They were, in many ways, a warm-up act for former Florida U.S. Rep. Alan Grayson, who used a national cable platform offered by MSNBC to excoriate Scott's plans. Grayson opened the interview on March 8, 2011, by answering a question about how Scott -- whose former hospital company Columbia/HCA pleaded guilty to 14 corporate felonies and paid $1.7 billion in fines -- could be elected governor in the first place. He said it was par for the course for Florida Republicans. "The last head of the Republican Party of Florida was literally led away in chains and indicted," Grayson said, referring to deposed RPOF chairman Jim Greer. Then Grayson cracked a joke, saying Scott once refused to answer questions during a deposition by invoking his 5th Amendment constitutional rights 75 times. "That’s like pleading the 375th." Grayson closed the interview by criticizing Scott’s plan to cut and eventually eliminate the state’s 5.5 percent corporate income tax, suggesting education spending reductions are funding the corporate tax cut. "He wants to eliminate the corporate income tax and cut corporate taxes in Florida by $1.5 billion," Grayson said. "He wants to cut funding for the schools by $1.5 billion. "He’s taking money out of children’s pockets dollar for dollar so he can stuff it in his own." We knew we’d find a fact check among all the one-liners. We wanted to see if Grayson’s shrewd ledger work is right: Does Scott’s budget reduce education funding by the same amount he would cut corporate taxes? The numbers are fairly easy to find, it turns out. Scott’s budget proposal for 2011-12 reduces the total amount of state K-12 education funding from $18.2 billion, to $16.5 billion -- a total cut of $1.7 billion. That number includes local property taxes the state mandates school boards collect (the required local effort), the state contribution from sales tax revenues and trust funds, and money passing through the state from the federal government. The cuts break down this way (we’re rounding a bit, so everything might not add up exactly): * The state’s contribution would decrease by about $11 million, but remain largely the same, about $8.9 billion. * Required local education taxes would shrink by about $660 million, and discretionary local taxes would shrink an additional $200 million -- shrinking the local contribution from about $8.4 billion to nearly $7.5 billion. * And the state also would not replace about $873 million in federal stimulus funds. On the other side of the ledger is Scott’s proposed cut to the 5.5 percent corporate income tax. The tax is exactly what it sounds like -- it’s paid as a percentage of the incomes of Florida businesses. Florida already has one of the lower corporate tax rates in the country, but Scott has made eliminating the tax a priority. As part of his 2011-12 budget, Scott proposes reducing the tax rate to 3 percent. His office says the reduction will save corporations $460 million. Put another way, the cut will trim state revenues as part of the 2011-12 budget by $460 million. It doesn’t take an Ivy League mathematics degree to figure out that the numbers don’t begin to line up the way Grayson suggests. The tax cuts represent $460 million, which is less than one third of the $1.7 billion education cut. Part of the issue might be Scott’s budget proposal is actually for two years -- 2011-12 and 2012-13. Over two years -- after factoring in a second reduction of the corporate income tax rate from 3 to 2.5 percent -- corporations would save a total of $1.5 billion, according to the governor’s office. But that’s not being fair -- $1.5 billion over two years doesn’t exactly compare to $1.7 billion over one year. In reviewing Scott’s tax-cutting proposals, it appears Grayson’s error also could have been singling out the corporate income tax as a way to cast Scott as a greedy CEO-type looking out only for his buddies. As we said in a previous item, Scott is proposing a total of $1.7 billion in tax and fee cuts as part of his 2011-12 budget. Scott’s proposal includes cuts to the corporate income tax, a cut to required school district property taxes, and a cut to unemployment taxes. PolitiFact Florida has previously ruled that roughly half of those cuts apply only to businesses, while half apply to homeowners and typical Floridians. Look at the numbers -- a total of $1.7 billion in tax and fee cuts in 2011-12 versus a proposed total education funding cut of $1.7 billion. They match (well, they’re not identical, because of rounding). And there’s one final way to look at this. The corporate income tax is estimated to collect about $2 billion in the current budget year. If it’s eliminated, a goal of Scott’s, that would be $2 billion less the state would receive. That’s on the order of the $1.7 billion K-12 education Scott is proposing for 2011-12. But again, that’s comparing additional budget years beyond even 2012-13 to cuts coming this year. On MSNBC, Grayson targeted Scott’s proposal to cut the corporate income tax, suggesting the cuts for corporate CEOs are being paid for on the back of students. While he’s right that any tax cut results in money not available to be spent on programs like education, he gets his numbers wrong. If Grayson had said the tax cuts and fees being proposed by Scott are being paid for by education cuts, he’d have more of a point. But sticking to what he said, we rate this claim Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.

pomt-10215	"While Sarah was Mayor of Wasilla she tried to fire our highly respected City Librarian because the Librarian refused to consider removing from the library some books that Sarah wanted removed."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/sep/09/chain-email/story-of-banned-books-is-murky/	One of the most potent claims in an e-mail written by Wasilla, Alaska, resident Anne Kilkenny is that when Sarah Palin was mayor, she tried to have some books removed from the city library. Here's how the claim reads in Kilkenny's e-mail: "While Sarah was Mayor of Wasilla she tried to fire our highly respected City Librarian because the Librarian refused to consider removing from the library some books that Sarah wanted removed. City residents rallied to the defense of the City Librarian and against Palin's attempt at out-and-out censorship, so Palin backed down and withdrew her termination letter." ( Read the entire e-mail for yourself here. ) The most definitive record for much of this issue comes from a Dec. 18, 1996, article in the Wasilla newspaper, the Frontiersman. In that story, Wasilla library director Mary Ellen Emmons (now Mary Ellen Baker) said that after Palin was elected mayor, she twice inquired about censoring library books. "I'm not trying to suppress anyone's views," Emmons told the Frontiersman. "But I told her (Palin) clearly, I will fight anyone who tries to dictate what books can go on the library shelves." "This is different than a normal book-selection procedure or a book-challenge policy," Emmons said. "She was asking me how I would deal with her saying a book can't be in the library." Palin told the Frontiersman that she had no particular books or other material in mind when she posed the questions to Emmons. In a written statement to the newspaper, Palin "said she was only trying to get acquainted with her staff" and that the question was "rhetorical." Also from the story: "Emmons said Palin asked her on Oct. 28 if she would object to censorship, even if people were circling the library in protest about a book. 'I told her it would definitely be a problem the ACLU would take on then,' Emmons said. "Asked who she thought might picket the library, Palin said Monday, 'Had no one in mind ... again, the issue was discussed in the context of a professional question being asked in regards to library policy.' " In an interview with PolitiFact, Kilkenny said the issue also came up at a council meeting soon after Palin took office in 1996. Time has passed, Kilkenny said, and she can't remember the exact words, but she said Palin asked Emmons something like, "What would your response be to my request to remove books from the library collection?" "I remember being shocked at the implication," Kilkenny said. She said that there was a long pause of silence, and that Emmons responded that books were selected in line with national criteria for a library its size. Kilkenny said she remembered Emmons concluded firmly: "I would absolutely not comply with your request." Kilkenny said Palin's request didn't sound rhetorical to her. The conversation between Palin and Emmons came the same week that Palin requested resignations from all the city department heads as a test of loyalty, the Frontiersman noted. Emmons, a popular librarian who was then president of the Alaska Library Association, did not resign. On Jan. 30, 1997, about six weeks after the story appeared, Palin told Emmons and the police chief that she was dismissing them. The next day, Palin changed her mind about Emmons and let her stay on. Emmons finally resigned in August 1999. ( See our ruling on the e-mail's claim about the police chief here. ) We can say for certain that no book was ever banned. Nor is there any record that Palin initiated a formal process to censor any books. June Pinell-Stephens, longtime chair of the Intellectual Freedom Committee of the Alaska Library Association, said she scoured the organization's archives and could find no record of any formal actions to ban books in Wasilla under Palin's tenure as mayor. That jibes with Wasilla Library records as well. "We have no records of any books being 'banned or censored' ever," Wasilla Mayor Diane M. Keller said in a statement released about the issue. Keller told PolitiFact that the city hasn't been able to find any minutes to substantiate that the issue was ever raised by Palin at a City Council meeting. Nor does Keller, who was a council member at the time, recall any such conversations. Jeanne Troshynski, president of the Friends of Wasilla Library, said the last formal request to remove a book came in 2005, with the challenge of a book written by Jon Stewart of The Daily Show called America (The Book): A Citizen's Guide to Democracy Inaction. That was three years after Palin left office as mayor. Wasilla records show the last formal challenge before that was in 1986 to Bumps in the Night, by Harvey Allard — well before Palin's tenure as mayor. In both cases, the challenges were denied and the books remained on the shelf. But Kilkenny's e-mail doesn't claim that Palin initiated a formal process to ban books. In fact, Kilkenny said she does not recall that Palin even mentioned specific books that she wanted banned. And Emmons, now Mary Ellen Baker, isn't talking. A message on her answering machine states: "I have nothing to add to reports from that time. I do not want to discuss the matter. Please respect my privacy." But the Frontiersman reporter who wrote that article in 1996 now says Emmons told him Palin did mention three books that she wanted removed from the shelves. Paul Stuart is semiretired, though he still occasionally contributes articles to a weekly paper, the Mountain Ear, in Conway, N.H., where he lives. Stuart told PolitiFact that in a conversation with Emmons after his article ran, she listed three titles. He said he could recall only two, and initially said they were I Told My Parents I'm Gay and I Asked My Sister. We looked for these titles; they don't appear to exist. "Mary Ellen told me that Palin asked her directly to remove these books from the shelves," Stuart said. "She refused." Asked later if the first book could have been Pastor, I am Gay, a controversial book written by a pastor who lives just outside Wasilla, Stuart said that was it. Howard Bess, author of Pastor, I am Gay and former pastor of Church of the Covenant in nearby Palmer, recalls that his book challenging Christians to re-examine their ideas about and prejudices against gays and lesbians was not well received in Wasilla when it was published in 1995 — the year before Palin was elected mayor. Virtually every book store in Wasilla refused to sell it. Bess said he gave two copies to the Wasilla Library, but they quickly disappeared. So he donated more copies. The controversy over the book was part of the context of that time period, he said. "Knowing Sarah's religious connections and the people involved, I would be surprised if my book was not one of those at issue," Bess said. "But I don't know that for a fact." "I don't think anyone has the facts except Mary Ellen, and she ain't talking," Bess said. In addition to Kilkenny's e-mail, there is another one circulating widely with the subject line, "The Books Sarah Palin tried to have banned." It purports to be a list taken from the official minutes of the Wasilla Library Board. ( Read it for yourself here. ) The 93 titles appear to be a generic list of frequently banned books. It was not part of the official minutes of the Wasilla Library Board. In fact, the Harry Potter series listed didn't even begin until 1998, two years after this list is alleged to have been generated. In short, the list is a fake. As for Kilkenny's claim, there is no proof that Palin tried to fire the librarian because she refused to consider removing books. In fact, Palin asked for the resignation of a handful of department heads to test their loyalty, according to reports at the time. The claim that Palin had specific books she wanted removed is also unsupported. Kilkenny herself said she does not recall that any titles were named by Palin at the time. Yes, a reporter provides a secondhand account 12 years later in which he says the librarian named books Palin wanted removed. But Stuart's recollection seems hazy (he didn't get the right title at first). The librarian isn't talking. There are no public records or meeting minutes to substantiate the claim. And no one else corroborates that Palin ever listed any titles. So we find no basis to find that part of the story true. But Palin did ask the librarian if she would consider removing books. Maybe it was posed as a rhetorical question as Palin says. But she asked. So we rule the statement Half True.	None	Chain email	None	None	None	2008-09-09T00:00:00	2008-08-31	['Wasilla,_Alaska']

Mitt Romney has a television ad in New Hampshire that attacks Sen. John McCain for his positions on taxes and illegal immigrants. Specifically, he charges that McCain "opposes repeal of the death tax," officially called the estate tax, a tax on the property passed forward and received at death. Just looking at the votes, Romney is right. The issue has come before the U.S. Senate at least three times, and each time McCain voted against permanently repealing the estate tax. But in a closer look at McCain's record, we find he supports a plan that would render the tax moot for most people. McCain says he wants a tax exemption on estates worth up to $10-million and a 15 percent tax on inheritances worth more than that. Under that plan, about 95 percent of the estate tax returns filed in 2006 would be exempt, according to Internal Revenue Service statistics. Which means the tax would survive for only the wealthiest few. Still, given McCain's votes against repealing the tax, we rule Romney's claim Mostly True.

pomt-07239	"In the late 1980s, the U.S. was nearly the lowest-taxed nation in the world, and a quarter century later we're nearly the highest."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/may/31/steve-moore/wall-street-journals-steve-moore-says-us-taxes-wer/	In a May 26, 2011, column in the Wall Street Journal, Stephen Moore, one of the editorial page editors, argued that the United States had low taxes compared to its rivals when Ronald Reagan was president, but now ranks among the world’s highest-taxed nations. "In the late 1980s," Moore wrote, "the U.S. was nearly the lowest taxed nation in the world, and a quarter century later we're nearly the highest." The claim came within a column that argued that proposals by President Barack Obama could effectively raise the marginal tax rate for the nation’s wealthiest taxpayers to 62 percent. We recently checked a similar claim by Rep. Paul Ryan, R-Wis., who said that Obama policies would lead to a top rate of 44.8 percent. (Ryan’s claim -- which earned a rating of Mostly True -- used less expansive parameters than Moore's did.) After a reader suggested that we look at the column, we zeroed in on Moore’s claim about comparative international taxes. We should start off by noting that most comparisons like these are not made with every nation in the world but rather with countries that belong to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, or OECD, a group of nearly three-dozen large, industrialized democracies. This makes it a fairer comparison. Because Moore was writing in the rest of the column about marginal personal income tax rates, we first turned to international comparisons of those rates for the OECD nations. We looked at data for 1988 -- Reagan’s last year in office, and a year when top U.S. marginal tax rates reached a new low -- as well as 2010. For 1988, the highest marginal tax rate for U.S. taxpayers was 28 percent. Of the 20 countries in the OECD comparison, only one had a lower rate -- Switzerland, at 11.5 percent. So using this statistic, Moore is correct. However, top marginal tax rates are an imperfect statistic for this kind of comparison. Perhaps the most important problem is that they only take into account national taxes. Some OECD nations levy relatively light taxes at the national level but heavy taxes at the state and local level. This makes international comparisons using only the national statistic incomplete. So we turned to another yardstick -- tax revenues as a percentage of gross domestic product. This measure shows how big the total tax burden is compared with a nation’s economy. It incorporates national, state and local taxes of all types, rather than just income taxes. OECD statistics are available for 1985, in a study of 26 nations. In the U.S., total tax revenue accounted for 25.6 percent of GDP. Only six nations had a lower percentage -- Mexico, Korea, Greece, Portugal, Switzerland and Turkey -- and several of those were not among the top ranks of industrialized nations in 1985. So here too, Moore’s has solid backing for his claim that in the 1980s "the U.S. was nearly the lowest-taxed nation in the world." But what about today? Here, the backing is less solid. Looking strictly at top marginal tax rates, the U.S. rate of 35 percent was solidly in the middle of the pack -- tied for 18th among the 34 nations studied. Moore’s claim doesn’t hold up any better if you use taxes as a percentage of GDP. In 2006 -- the most recent year for which an OECD comparison is available -- taxes accounted for 28 percent of U.S. GDP, up modestly from what it was in 1985. All told, 25 nations had a higher percentage than the U.S., while just four -- Mexico, Japan, Korea and Turkey -- had a lower percentage. That hardly makes the U.S. "nearly the highest" taxed nation in the world. In fact, in order to rank in the top five nations on the 2006 list, the U.S. would have needed taxes to account for 43 percent of GDP -- about one and a half times their actual share. When we asked Moore if there was any data we were missing that would prove his point about the U.S. tax burden today, he said, "today our corporate tax rate is highest and our personal income tax with the Obama proposals (included) would be well above average." He’s basically correct that our corporate tax rate is the world’s highest -- we’ve ruled that claim Mostly True in the past, although for many companies, loopholes and other tax rules bring down the rate they actually pay. Even so, nowhere in the column does Moore bring up corporate or business taxes, so we don’t think that’s strong support for his claim. As for potential tax increases under Obama, those are speculative. Because of that, we don’t see them as justification for stating that "a quarter century later we're nearly the highest" in taxation. Moore would have been on safer ground if he’d written, "If the increases I’ve outlined here are enacted, we might end up with some of the highest tax rates in the world." But even this would be speculative, since we wouldn’t know what other countries’ tax rates will be if and when the U.S. hikes Moore opposes are enacted. We have no quarrel with Moore’s characterization of the late 1980s as a period when U.S. taxes were low compared with its rivals. It clearly was. But Moore's main point, that taxes have gone up significantly since the late 1980s, is a stretch. To the contrary, we find convincing evidence that the U.S. today remains a relatively low-tax nation compared to its industrialized competitors. U.S. tax rates might go up over the next few years, but that's speculation, not established facts. On balance, we rate Moore's comment Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.

pomt-13273	"Lindsay Parkhurst wants to take away programs like Social Security and Medicare that seniors have earned throughout their lifetimes."	pants on fire!	/illinois/statements/2016/oct/13/katherine-cloonen/cloonen-says-her-gop-opponent-wants-strip-seniors/	Few local legislative races in Illinois are as hotly contested as the one in the 79th District between incumbent state Rep. Kate Cloonen, D-Kankakee, and her Republican challenger Lindsay Parkhurst. Cloonen, who won the 2014 election by a mere 122 votes and the 2012 election by just 91, is seeking her third term in the General Assembly. Parkhurst is a political newcomer and a defense attorney who has headed a general practice law firm for 16 years, during which she has represented clients in Social Security disability and workers’ compensation cases. In a Sept. 21 campaign ad posted on Cloonen’s Facebook page, she claimed, "Lindsay Parkhurst wants to take away programs like Social Security and Medicare that seniors have earned throughout their lifetimes." Since state lawmakers play no role in these federal programs, we decided to check the record to see if there’s any merit to Cloonen’s claim. Confusing claim Cloonen’s campaign did not respond to multiple emails and phone messages requesting information and sources used to back up her claim. The ad cites three articles from 2011 by the Philadelphia Tribune, NPR and Bloomberg.com, as well as a March 2014 article by the Chicago Tribune. However, the NPR article dated March 29, 2011, was about Democratic members of Congress holding a rally to support Social Security. The Bloomberg story from Aug. 12, 2011, was about former GOP congresswoman and presidential candidate Michele Bachmann calling for cuts to Social Security and Medicare for future recipients. Neither article mentions Parkhurst. A search of the Philadelphia Tribune and Chicago Tribune archives did not yield any results for the dates listed. But considering Parkhurst was a private citizen at the time and not even on the political radar, it’s unlikely these news stories would include any mention of her, let alone describe her position on Medicare and Social Security benefits for seniors. In a phone interview, Parkhurst told PolitiFact Illinois she has no idea where the Cloonen camp got this information to level the accusation. Parkhurst noted she has represented clients in cases involving Social Security disability benefits for people who were not at the eligible age of 65 -- the opposite of what Cloonen’s ad suggests. "I advocate for people to qualify and obtain those benefits," Parkhurst said. "I have been an advocate for 16 years." When asked about her general position on Social Security and Medicare, Parkhurst said both are part of a contract the federal government has made with U.S. citizens and one that must be honored, not eliminated. Regardless, the claim against Parkhurst is curious because state lawmakers have no authority over these federal programs. State role in Social Security and Medicare Charlie Wheeler, director of the Public Affairs Reporting graduate program at the University of Illinois-Springfield and a long-time former politics and government reporter for the Chicago Sun-Times, says the ad attempts to make a connection that’s not there and ignores the fact that the state only administers these programs and cannot eliminate Social Security benefits or Medicare for seniors. Wheeler said the only quasi-logical explanation behind Cloonen’s claim is that the Democrat is trying to tie Parkhurst to the GOP’s national platform, which many believe includes policies that would hurt the Social Security program. It’s a very old and common campaign tactic to link a local legislative candidate to his or her party’s broader policies and scandals, Wheeler noted, pointing to recent TV ads and campaign mailers in which Democratic and Republican candidates have tried linking their opponents to sex offenders. "The state Legislature and state law have very little to do with Social Security and Medicare. Those are federal programs," Wheeler said. "State involvement would be to the extent that it collects Social Security taxes and passes them on to the federal government." Our ruling In a campaign ad posted on Facebook, Cloonen said, "Lindsay Parkhurst wants to take away programs like Social Security and Medicare that seniors have earned throughout their lifetimes." With Social Security and Medicare being federal programs, state lawmakers have no say in setting benefit levels for these programs. Additionally, Parkhurst has not previously held elected office and therefore has no public voting record on Social Security or Medicare. Nor has she talked about her position on Medicare or Social Security benefits in her campaign. Ironically, Parkhurst is a defense attorney whose law firm has helped clients obtain Social Security disability benefits. She believes both Social Security and Medicare are part of a contract the federal government must honor. Cloonen’s campaign did not respond to multiple emails and messages for comment, and the articles cited in the ad contain no mention of Parkhurst. There is no evidence to back Cloonen’s claim, nor can we find any statement or action by Parkhurst that would have, even indirectly, elicited it. We rate Cloonen’s claim Pants on Fire. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/487f0897-a88a-4c8f-a8c5-4d5464447785	None	Katherine Cloonen	None	None	None	2016-10-13T14:12:31	2016-09-21	['Medicare_(United_States)']

pomt-07784	"The firefighters, the policemen and others who supported (Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker) in his election bid ... don't have to worry about their collective bargaining rights."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/feb/21/donna-brazile/donna-brazile-says-unions-supported-scott-walker-a/	The ongoing budget crisis in Wisconsin got pundits George Will and Donna Brazile debating on This Week with Christiane Amanpour. Will said that changes proposed by Gov. Scott Walker were reasonable and necessary given budget constraints. Brazile countered that the governor was using the excuse of a budget battle to destroy collective bargaining rights for public employee unions. "And, look, what we're talking about is that the governor has cherry-picked what public workers he will subject to this so-called removal of their collective bargaining rights," Brazile said. "The firefighters, the policemen and others who supported him in his election bid, well, guess what? They don't have to worry about their collective bargaining rights." Brazile implied that this was political payback, and we want to be clear that we’re not checking Walker’s motivations. We’re looking only at whether "the firefighters, the policemen and others who supported him in his election bid ... don't have to worry about their collective bargaining rights." Our first stop was checking Walker’s proposal. It asks state workers to pay more for their pensions and health insurance, which reduces take-home pay. But it also sets limits on collective bargaining power for the public sector unions. In a letter to public workers, Walker explained that his proposal would limit bargaining only to base pay, which means unions could not bargain for improved health insurance, working conditions or pension benefits. Pay increases would be limited to increases in the cost of living, using the Consumer Price Index, unless voters approved other pay increases via a referendum. Union members would have to vote to stay unionized each year, and contracts could only last only a year, among other limitations. Walker concluded the list of changes by noting, "Local police and fire employees and State Patrol Troopers and Inspectors are exempted from these changes." So Brazile is right that police, firefighters and others are exempt. Our next question was, are these the groups "who supported him in his election bid"? During the campaign last November, leaders of the Milwaukee Professional Firefighters Association and Milwaukee Police Association appeared in an ad supporting Walker and blasting his opponent, Democrat Tom Barrett. Walker also won endorsements from the West Allis Professional Police Association and the Wisconsin Troopers Association Walker didn’t get the endorsements of two statewide unions, the Wisconsin Professional Police Association and the Professional Fire Fighters of Wisconsin, which both backed Barrett. For the record, the governor told the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel that the charge that he was exempting police and firefighters was "ridiculous." He said he didn't recommend changing the rules for police officers and firefighters because he didn’t want public safety work disrupted. We then contacted the Wisconsin Professional Police Association, the statewide union that endorsed Walker's opponent last year. Executive director Jim Palmer said the statewide organization is much larger than the local Milwaukee police union that endorsed Walker. The state group has approximately 11,000 members versus Milwaukee’s roughly 1,400, he said. Similarly, the state firefighters association has more than 3,000, compared with the Milwaukee union’s 875. The state police union is opposed to the changes Walker is proposing for other public sector workers, which include county jailers and police dispatchers, Palmer said. The statewide firefighters' union also opposes the proposal. Palmer said he believes that Walker exempted police and firefighters not for political payback, but because they are the public workers who are most popular with the public. "And in that way, it’s very political," he said. Brazile said, "The firefighters, the policemen and others who supported (Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker) in his election bid ... don't have to worry about their collective bargaining rights." It’s true that Walker won the endorsement of Milwaukee police and firefighter organizations, and they won’t lose collective bargaining rights if Walker’s proposal succeeds. But not all unions supported Walker. In fact, the two significant statewide organizations endorsed his opponent, and they too would be exempt from restrictions on collective bargaining. Because the statement leaves out the fact that the police and fire unions broke ranks on whether or not to support Walker, we rate this statement Half True.

pomt-01894	Says Greg Abbott "has lost" in court "four times in just the past few days."	mostly true	/texas/statements/2014/jul/06/wendy-davis/greg-abbott-sustained-four-setbacks-court-though-h/	State Sen. Wendy Davis wink-admonished delegates to last month’s Texas Democratic Party convention not to "clap too much" for her "or Greg Abbott will sue you." Davis, the party’s nominee for governor, then noted that Abbott, the state attorney general and Republican gubernatorial choice, often boasts about going to work, suing the federal government and going home. In May 2013, we rated as True Abbott’s claim he’d sued President Barack Obama’s administration 25 times. "He is so proud of that," Davis said. "But what he doesn’t say is that our judges go to work; they rule against him and the people of this state win. In fact, he has lost four times in just the past few days. If he... were your lawyer," Davis said, "you would fire him on the spot." Four Abbott losses in a June jiffy? Davis's list of Abbott's "losses" By email, Davis spokesman Zac Petkanas pointed out news stories published over a week in June 2014 describing court actions while Abbott’s office separately responded that Davis failed to note key details. Let’s walk through how Davis backed up her statement before laying out Abbott’s objections. On June 16, 2014, according to a Dallas Morning News blog post, a state appeals court ruled a former Texas assistant attorney general, Ginger Weatherspoon, could proceed with her lawsuit charging she’d been fired for refusing to lie under oath about a judge. The story said: "The AG’s office has spent years trying to get the suit tossed, claiming, among other things, that Weatherspoon didn’t make a ‘good faith’ effort to blow the whistle to the right links in the chain of command. A three-justice panel disagreed, and issued an opinion Monday written by Justice David Evans that said Dallas County Judge Martin Hoffman did the right thing last year when he refused to grant the AG’s office its request for summary judgment." In the opinion, Evans said Weatherspoon reported suspected criminal violations to appropriate authorities inside the attorney general’s office. She "has sufficiently alleged that she made good faith report of a violation of law by another public employee to an appropriate law enforcement authority," Evans wrote. According to a June 18, 2014, news story in the Austin American-Statesman, a federal judge in Washington, D.C., ordered the state to pay almost $1.1 million in legal fees to lawyers who represented Davis and minority rights groups in a legal challenge to district boundaries drawn by the Republican-majority Legislature. The story said: "U.S. District Judge Rosemary Collyer’s order criticized lawyers in" Abbott’s "office for submitting a legal brief that devoted more effort to complaining than it did to answering the legal issues in the fight over lawyer fees." Collyer, an appointee of President George W. Bush, wrote: "This matter presents a case study in how not to respond to a motion for attorney fees and costs." Five days later, a state judge had spurned Abbott’s attempt to remove state District Judge John Dietz from presiding over the long-running public school finance case, the Statesman reported. Abbott, facing a likely legal defeat in the case as a whole, had argued emails showed the judge was biased in favor of school district lawyers seeking to have the state’s school-finance system declared unconstitutional, the story said. Visiting Judge David Peeples found Dietz had "acted in good faith, holding out-of-court conversations with plaintiffs lawyers because ‘he believed that all parties had agreed to let such discussions take place,’" the story said. The same day, the Texas Tribune summed up a U.S. Supreme Court ruling as the "latest loss for Texas in its ongoing campaign against the federal government and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency." The Tribune news story went on to say the court had "largely dismissed" Abbott’s "challenge of federal climate rules. Seven justices agreed that the EPA is allowed to regulate greenhouse gas emissions from most large industrial facilities, like power plants and factories." Based on the accounts offered by Davis, it looks like Abbott experienced an unappealable loss at the Supreme Court (the EPA case), the loss clearing the way for a former employee to have her day in court, plus two losses that could yet lead to appeals courts making win-or-loss rulings. Abbott's office objects Abbott's state spokesman, Jerry Strickland, said the turns were not so clear-cut. Besides, Strickland told us by email, Davis failed to note a criminal prosecution simultaneously completed by Abbott’s office. According to a Statesman news story posted online June 20, 2014, a Bastrop County jury sentenced a former teacher to 15 years in prison for sexually assaulting a student; the attorney general’s office handled the case after the Bastrop County district attorney’s office recused itself. Of course, Davis didn’t say Abbott had four losses uninterrupted. Strickland said of three of the results Davis was referencing: The decision enabling the former employee’s lawsuit to proceed was only procedural. "Citing the decision as a loss when the case hasn’t even gone before a judge is like saying a team won the game because they won the pre-game coin flip," Strickland said. The D.C. judge who awarded attorney fees also issued a stay on the decision, pausing her order so the state could appeal. The decision not to order Dietz’s removal from the school funding lawsuit didn’t determine how the finance lawsuit itself will be judged on the state’s appeal to the Texas Supreme Court. "No matter what happens on any day, in any motions in the school finance case, those decisions along the way are not the final word," Strickland said. Past those, Strickland said Abbott won the EPA case "on the issues we argued." Specifically, Strickland said, the high court overturned the EPA’s illegal greenhouse gas permitting scheme after determining that it ignored federal law, exceeded the authority granted the agency by Congress and violated the federal Clean Air Act. "That was precisely what the state argued and thus, this was a win" for Abbott, Strickland said. The court’s decision affirmed and reversed, in part, a lower court’s ruling in EPA’s favor. The justices basically said the EPA had exceeded its statutory authority when it interpreted the Clean Air Act to require certain kinds of permitting for industrial plants based on their greenhouse-gas emissions. On the other hand, the court concluded, the agency may continue to treat greenhouse gases as a pollutant subject to regulation under federal law. Expert analyst revisits EPA ruling For expert perspective, we asked Lyle Denniston, a reporter who analyzes Supreme Court decisions for the online Supreme Court of the United States blog, to speak to how Abbott and the state of Texas fared in the EPA case. Denniston said by email that states including Texas made arguments that paralleled those offered by lawyers for business firms--and those arguments prevailed. Specifically, he said, the states said EPA couldn’t bootstrap its regulation of greenhouse gases from motor vehicle exhausts into a broad regime of regulating greenhouse gases from industrial plants. Still, Denniston said, Texas fell short of a complete victory because the court didn’t agree the EPA has no authority to regulate greenhouse gas emissions from power plants and other stationary sources. Rather, he wrote, the court decided EPA could regulate greenhouse gases from sources already that were obliged, under law, to curb air pollution--meaning the agency could regulate 83 percent of greenhouse gas sources instead of the 86 percent that would have come under its regulatory sway if the administration’s broadest argument had stuck, Denniston said. Strickland, provided Denniston’s comments, cautioned against reading the high court’s ruling too narrowly. The case, Strickland emailed, "was about separation of powers, and the limits of EPA's authority. The court rebuked what they saw as a federal government that tried to rewrite the rules and laws, without legislative approval. This is a victory" for Abbott. Our ruling Davis said Abbott "has lost" in court "four times in just the past few days." Abbott sustained four legal setbacks, we conclude, but the Democrat's statement needs clarification. Three rulings could prove to be bumps along the road o’ litigation possibly culminating in Abbott wins. And in the EPA case, the justices partly agreed with Texas, though they upheld federal regulation of greenhouse gases as pollutants. Notably, too, just one of the referenced rulings involved the Obama administration. We rate this claim as Mostly True.

abbc-00237	Since the summer break, tensions have been simmering within the Coalition over electric vehicles. Although Environment Minister Josh Frydenberg has thrown his support behind electric cars, some on the government benches are yet to be convinced.	in-between	http://www.abc.net.au/news/2018-03-07/fact-check-does-corolla-emit-less-than-tesla/9461096	The data on the Green Vehicle Guide website shows only the more powerful Tesla models emitted "close to 200 grams" of carbon dioxide per kilometre. Most emitted less, some considerably less. Mr Kelly referred to "a Tesla" and "a Corolla". However, the website lists 27 different models of Tesla, with emissions varying depending on the model. At the time Mr Kelly made his claim (the website has since been updated), emissions for the various Tesla models ranged from 174 to 212 grams of carbon dioxide per kilometre. For petrol Corolla models, emissions ranged from 171 to 191 grams of carbon dioxide per kilometre. However, according to experts, the data for the emissions intensity of the energy grid was out of date at the time the claim was made. The website has been updated since Mr Kelly made his claim with data reflecting the 2015-16 electricity mix between coal, gas and renewables. This resulted in a significant improvement in the reported environmental performance of the Tesla compared with petrol Corollas, such that five models of Tesla had higher emissions than the most polluting Corolla (191 grams of CO2 per kilometre), compared with 22 that were less polluting. After the update, 17 models of Tesla had higher emissions than the least polluting petrol Corolla (171 grams of CO2 per kilometre), while 10 had lower emissions than even the most environmentally friendly petrol Corolla. Mr Kelly does have a point — not all Tesla models are cleaner than Corollas. However, it is a stretch to suggest — even using out-of-date 2013-14 data for the emissions intensity of the electricity grid — that Corollas have "significantly" lower emissions than Teslas. And experts said it was misleading to compare high-performance cars with mid-performance ones. They pointed out that a fairer comparison for a Corolla was a small electric car such as a Renault Zoe, which according to the latest data on the website emits between 121 and 136 grams of carbon dioxide per kilometre — less than any of the five petrol Corollas.

pomt-03909	"About two-thirds of all consumption is services. . . It was just the opposite" when the sales tax was enacted in the '30s.	mostly true	/ohio/statements/2013/feb/27/joseph-testa/ohio-tax-commissioner-joseph-testa-says-consumptio/	Ohio Gov. John Kasich has proposed a broad overhaul of the state’s tax system as part of his biennial budget proposal. At a news conference to unveil his plans, he called on Ohio Tax Commissioner Joseph Testa to help explain proposed changes in the tax code. The governor’s proposal includes cuts to the state’s personal income tax and a 50 percent income deduction for small businesses. One way some of that revenue loss would be offset is through changes to the state’s sales tax. While the 5.5 percent rate would be cut to 5 percent, the tax base would be broadened by applying it to most services. It now principally applies just to sales of goods. Testa, while explaining the plan, said the changes were long overdue and needed to address the evolution of the state’s economy over nearly eight decades. "About two-thirds of all consumption is services. The tax code has never been updated to address that. It was just the opposite (when the tax was enacted) in the '30s." PolitiFact Ohio decided to assess the tax commissioner’s claim. Ohio enacted its sales tax in 1935 as a way to raise revenue to help public schools that were struggling to pay their bills during the Great Depression. At the time, most schools received their funding through property taxes. Many Ohioans failed to pay their taxes because of the difficult economic times, according to Ohio History Central, an online product of the Ohio Historical Society. As a result, schools had less money to pay educational expenses. Prior to enactment of the Ohio Retail Sales Tax Law there were taxes on sales of cigarettes and gasoline, but on few other products. The new tax extended to nearly all goods, and dramatically increased tax receipts. It raised nearly $17 million for public schools in 1935. Some revenue also went to help local governments. Since then, the tax has remained focused on the sale of goods. The governor’s budget proposal, though, would add the tax to sales associated with nearly all services. Everything from haircuts and movie tickets to lawyer bills and real estate services would be subject to a 5-cent tax on every dollar. But what about Testa’s contention that Ohio’s economy has evolved and that transactions involving services now account for two-thirds of all personal consumption expenditures? We contacted Testa’s office to ask on what he based his statement. Were there numbers to support the reversal in spending habits? Gary Gudmundson, a spokesman for Testa, provided a chart that the Department of Taxation had prepared for the budget rollout. It attributed its figures to the Bureau of Economic Analysis, which is part of the U.S. Department of Commerce. For 1935, the year Ohio enacted the sales tax, it showed total personal consumption of $55.9 billion, with $31.6 billion (56.5 percent) going toward goods and $24.3 billion (43.5 percent) going to services. Not quite 2-to-1 in favor of goods, but goods sales accounted for a solid majority of purchases. Money spent on personal consumption climbed steadily over the years. By 2012 the total consumption figure was about $11.12 trillion. About $3.78 trillion (34 percent) was for goods purchases. About $7.34 trillion (66 percent) was for services. We checked and the numbers provided in the state’s chart match the Bureau of Economic Analysis data. It should be noted, though, that the data reflects money spent on goods and services on a national basis. The Bureau of Economic Analysis told us that it didn’t have state-by-state data. Gudmundson said the state had rough figures that only went back to the ‘80s, but that the expectation was that Ohio, as one of the larger states in the nation, would have economic experience similar to the national figures. State-specific numbers on production help bolster Testa’s contention, although production is not the same as consumption. In 2011, the state saw $326 billion in privately produced services and $102 billion in privately produced goods. The figures illustrate "the continuing shift in Ohio’s economy away from goods production and towards services," according to a report last year from Ohio’s Policy Research and Strategic Planning Office. So where does that leave Testa’s claim? He said that about two-thirds of consumption is for services, and on a national basis, data shows he is correct. One could reasonably conclude that the same trend holds true in Ohio. Testa also said it was just the opposite when the state enacted its sales tax. On a national basis, the goods purchases didn’t account for two-thirds of total consumption in 1935, but it was a significant majority. And the numbers support Testa’s overarching point that the economy has changed significantly since then to be a service dominated market. With those points of clarification, the tax commissioner’s claim rates Mostly True.	None	Joseph Testa	None	None	None	2013-02-27T16:59:31	2013-02-04	['None']
pomt-04031	Research shows that "a vast majority of arriving immigrants today come here because they believe that government is the source of prosperity, and that's what they support."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2013/jan/31/rush-limbaugh/limbaugh-says-immigrants-come-us-seeking-prosperit/	Florida Sen. Marco Rubio talked immigration recently with conservative radio host Rush Limbaugh, steering into an interesting side issue: why people come to the U.S. "You look at people that come from Latin America. They come to get away from stale, stagnant economies where the rich keep winning and everybody else keeps working for them because big government dominates those economies," Rubio said. To which Limbaugh responded: "Well, is that the reason that a majority of immigrants come to this country today? I know it used to be. They wanted to be Americans. They wanted to escape oppression. They wanted to become citizens of the greatest country on earth. I've seen a number of research, scholarly research data which says that a vast majority of arriving immigrants today come here because they believe that government is the source of prosperity, and that's what they support." Here, we’ll look into Limbaugh’s assertion that belief in an expansive central government is what draws people to our shores. Polling Hispanics We did not hear back from Limbaugh’s show, but we suspect that the research he referred to is a 2012 Pew Research Hispanic Center poll, asking Hispanics about their political ideology. The poll broke down the results by generation, so it’s possible to distinguish first-generation Hispanics (i.e., immigrants) from U.S.-born Hispanics. The poll, which queried 1,220 Latino respondents ages 18 and older, asked, "Would you rather have a smaller government providing fewer services, or a bigger government providing more services?" In the results, 75 percent of Hispanics said they preferred bigger government (compared with 41 percent of the general population.) A breakdown by generation showed an even greater skew: Among first-generation Hispanics (i.e., immigrants), 81 percent favored bigger government. In the second generation, 72 percent favored bigger government, and the figure fell to 58 percent in the third generation and higher. Steven Camarota, with the Center for Immigration Studies, a group that favors stricter immigration laws, pointed us to another Pew poll asking people’s opinions of socialism, capitalism and libertarianism. Among blacks, whites and Hispanics, Hispanics had the most unfavorable view of capitalism: 55 percent. Overall, 50 percent had a favorable view of capitalism, while 40 percent had an unfavorable view.) In Camarota’s view, "the general sentiment (of Limbaugh’s statement) seems to be right that a very large fraction -- of Hispanics anyway -- show a very strong sentiment toward what could be called progressive or liberal views of government." But that’s just Hispanics, and Limbaugh simply referred to "a vast majority of arriving immigrants." Camarota cited similar figures about Asian immigrants, also from Pew polling. In a 2012 survey, 57 percent of foreign-born Asians in the U.S. said they prefer a bigger government that provides more services, while 33 percent want a smaller government providing fewer services. So there is evidence that recent immigrants, at least among Hispanics and Asians, favor more government, which could reasonably be construed as a belief that "government is the source of prosperity," as Limbaugh said. But is that belief the reason people immigrate? Jobs & family Alex Nowrasteh, immigration policy analyst with the libertarian Cato Institute, dismissed Limbaugh’s claim as off-base. "If Rush Limbaugh was right, we would not have people leaving during a recession like we did," Nowrasteh said in an interview. "About a million unauthorized immigrants have gone home to their home countries because there are no jobs for them here." A separate study by the Cato Institute says "immigrants come to America today to build a better life through work, not welfare, just as they have throughout American history." It backs up this point with U.S. Department of Labor data on labor force participation. Among foreign-born people, the work rate was 67.9 percent in 2010, compared to the native-born rate of 64.1 percent. It’s worth noting that welfare benefits are generally not available to immigrants. Illegal immigrants, of course, cannot receive public services such as cash assistance or Medicaid at all, and legal immigrants aren’t eligible for five years. Other programs are totally inaccessible until they become citizens. "Undoubtedly, there are undocumented immigrants getting some of those things. But they are for the most part not eligible," said Jeffrey Passel, a demographer at the Pew Hispanic Center. Immigration patterns indicate that that "source of prosperity" isn’t what immigrants seek anyway. "Immigrants go to states that have smaller benefits for welfare recipients," Nowrasteh said. "They go to the states that have the fastest-growing economies. If they were coming for welfare, they’d go to the places with the biggest welfare states." A wide-ranging international survey by Gallup of people all over the globe found that 150 million adults worldwide would like to migrate to the U.S., making it by far the top desired destination. "Opportunity" was the most common reason given, meaning "the chance to join family members who are already in other countries, to start a new business, to express one's views without fear, or to live where children are treated with respect." Gallup also found that the human development index of the country of origin was a significant factor too. That index measures citizens’ health, life expectancy, schooling options and wealth. The poll found that the desire to migrate "tends to be higher in countries with medium to low human development." Our ruling Limbaugh said research shows that "a vast majority of arriving immigrants today come here because they believe that government is the source of prosperity, and that's what they support." Surveys of Hispanic and Asian immigrants show that majorities of immigrants favor bigger government, which could be the "source of prosperity" Limbaugh meant. But we could find no research to say that those views are what drive people to immigrate. Family connections and job opportunities in the U.S. are the most common reasons cited in studies. Limbaugh’s claim contains a grain of truth but makes a misleading causal connection. That fits our definition of Mostly False.

pomt-09879	John Holdren, director of the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy, "has proposed forcing abortions and putting sterilants in the drinking water to control population."	pants on fire!	/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/jul/29/glenn-beck/glenn-beck-claims-science-czar-john-holdren-propos/	As evidence that the country is closer to socialist than capitalist these days, radio and talk show host Glenn Beck recently made this claim about John Holdren, director of the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy: "I mean, we've got czars now," Beck said during his July 22, 2009, program. "Czars like John Holdren, who has proposed forcing abortions and putting sterilants in the drinking water to control population." Political figures like Holdren, who are little-known by most Americans, make easy targets. And Beck's biting quick hit on Holdren provides a healthy enough dose of outrage on which to hang his argument. But is it true? Beck's allegation has its roots in a book Holdren co-authored with Paul and Annie Ehrlich more than three decades ago called Ecoscience: Population, Resources, Environment . Conservative bloggers have quoted the book extensively, and often out of context, to make the point that Holdren has advocated positions such as the ones Beck stated. We obtained the book to see exactly what Holdren, then a young man, wrote (or co-wrote). The book is just over 1,000 pages, and it clearly makes that case that an explosion in population presented a grave crisis. Although it is a textbook, the authors don't shy away from presenting a point of view. As the preface states, "We have tried throughout the book to state clearly where we stand on various matters of controversy." In a section on "Involuntary Fertility Control," Holdren and the other authors discuss various "coercive" means of population control — including putting sterilants in the drinking water. But they stop well short of advocating such measures. Here's a few excerpts: "The third approach to population limitation is that of involuntary fertility control. Several coercive proposals deserve discussion, mainly because some countries may ultimately have to resort to them unless current trends in birth rates are rapidly reversed by other means. ... "Adding a sterilant to drinking water or staple foods is a suggestion that seems to horrify people more than most proposals for involuntary fertility control. Indeed, this would pose some very difficult political, legal, and social questions, to say nothing of the technical problems. No such sterilant exists today, nor does one appear to be under development. To be acceptable, such a substance would have to meet some rather stiff requirements: it must be uniformly effective, despite widely varying doses received by individuals, and despite varying degrees of fertility and sensitivity among individuals; it must be free of dangerous or unpleasant side effects; and it must have no effect on members of the opposite sex, children, old people, pets, or livestock. ... "Again, there is no sign of such an agent on the horizon. And the risk of serious, unforeseen side effects would, in our opinion, militate against the use of any such agent, even though this plan has the advantage of avoiding the need for socioeconomic pressures that might tend to discriminate against particular groups or penalize children." Later, the authors conclude, "Most of the population control measures beyond family planning discussed above have never been tried. Some are as yet technically impossible and others are and probably will remain unacceptable to most societies (although, of course, the potential effectiveness of those least acceptable measures may be great). "Compulsory control of family size is an unpalatable idea, but the alternatives may be much more horrifying. As those alternatives become clearer to an increasing number of people in the 1980s, they may begin demanding such control. A far better choice, in our view, is to expand the use of milder methods of influencing family size preferences, while redoubling efforts to ensure that the means of birth control, including abortion and sterilization, are accessible to every human being on Earth within the shortest possible time. If effective action is taken promptly against population growth, perhaps the need for the more extreme involuntary or repressive measures can be averted in most countries." And here's the part that some have interpreted as Holdren advocating for forced abortions. "To date, there has been no serious attempt in Western countries to use laws to control excessive population growth, although there exists ample authority under which population growth could be regulated. For example, under the United States Constitution, effective population-control programs could be enacted under the clauses that empower Congress to appropriate funds to provide for the general welfare and to regulate commerce, or under the equal-protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. Such laws constitutionally could be very broad. Indeed, it has been concluded that compulsory population-control laws, even including laws requiring compulsory abortion, could be sustained under the existing Constitution if the population crisis became sufficiently severe to endanger the society. Few today consider the situation in the United States serious enough to justify compulsion, however." This comes in a section discussing population law. The authors argue that compulsory abortions could potentially be allowed under U.S. law "if the population crisis became sufficiently severe to endanger the society." Again, that's a far cry from advocating or proposing such a position. In the book, the authors certainly advocate making abortions readily accessible for women who want to get them. But they never advocate forced abortions. Big difference. In response to the comments from Beck and others, Holdren's office issued this statement: "The quotations used to suggest that Dr. Holdren supports coercive approaches to limiting population growth were taken from a 1977 college textbook on environmental science and policy, of which he was the third author. The quoted material was from a section of the book that described different possible approaches to limiting population growth and then concluded that the authors’ own preference was to employ the noncoercive approaches before the environmental and social impacts of overpopulation led desperate societies to employ coercive ones. Dr. Holdren has never been an advocate of compulsory abortions or other repressive means of population limitation." Holdren's office also provided a statement from Annie and Paul Ehrlich, the co-authors: "We have been shocked at the serious mischaracterization of our views and those of John Holdren in blog posts based on misreadings of our jointly-authored 1000-page 1977 textbook, ECOSCIENCE. We were not then, never have been, and are not now 'advocates' of the Draconian measures for population limitation described — but not recommended — in the book's 60-plus small-type pages cataloging the full spectrum of population policies that, at the time, had either been tried in some country or analyzed by some commentator. Under questioning by Sen. David Vitter, R-La., during his Senate confirmation hearing, Holdren said he "no longer thinks it's productive to focus on optimum population for the United States. ... I think the key thing today is that we need to work to improve the conditions that all of our citizens face economically, environmentally, and in other respects. And we need to aim for something that I have for years been calling 'sustainable prosperity.'" Vitter continued with his line of question, asking directly, "Do you think determining optimal population is a proper role of government?" Said Holdren: "No, senator, I do not. ... I think the proper role of government is to develop and deploy the policies with respect to economy, environment, security, that will ensure the well-being of the citizens we have." But with regard to Beck's claim that Holdren "has proposed forcing abortions and putting sterilants in the drinking water to control population," the text of the book clearly does not support that. We think a thorough reading shows that these were ideas presented as approaches that had been discussed. They were not posed as suggestions or proposals. In fact, the authors make clear that they did not support coercive means of population control. Certainly, nowhere in the book do the authors advocate for forced abortions. Some have argued that Holdren's view of the imminent and grave global dangers posed by overpopulation should provide pause, given Holdren's current view that global warming now presents imminent and grave global dangers. That's a matter for reasoned debate. But in seeking to score points for a political argument, Beck seriously mischaracterizes Holdren's positions. Holdren didn't advocate those ideas then. And, when asked at a Senate confirmation hearing, Holdren said he did not support them now. We think it's irresponsible to pluck a few lines from a 1,000-page, 30-year-old textbook, and then present them out of context to dismiss Holdren's long and distinguished career.

pomt-09490	"Since 1981, reconciliation has been used 21 times. Most of it's been used by Republicans."	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/feb/25/harry-reid/reid-says-repblicans-have-used-reconciliation-more/	Although the Feb. 25, 2010, televised health care summit was billed by President Barack Obama as an attempt to forge some bipartisan agreement, it didn't take long for the talk to turn to reconciliation. Reconciliation is a legislative procedure adopted in 1974 to balance budget bills. It can be a complex process, but what you really need to know about a reconciliation bill is that it can be passed with a simple majority, rather than the 60-vote supermajority Democrats lost when Scott Brown of Massachusetts was elected to the Senate. In other words, it's an option some Democrats are mulling if a bipartisan plan cannot be achieved. In the Republicans' opening statement, Sen. Lamar Alexander, R-Tenn., said, "You can say that this process has been used before, and that would be right. But it's never been used for anything like this. It's not appropriate to use to write the rules for 17 percent of the economy." Alexander quoted Alexis de Tocqueville that the greatest threat to the American democracy would be the tyranny of the majority. Soon after, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid accused Republicans of having a bit of amnesia on reconciliation. "No one has talked about reconciliation, but that's what you folks have talked about ever since that came out, as if it's something that has never been done before," Reid said. "Now, we as leaders here, the speaker and I, have not talked about doing reconciliation as the only way out of all this. Of course it's not the only way out. But remember, since 1981, reconciliation has been used 21 times. Most of it's been used by Republicans for major things, like much of the Contract for America, Medicare reform, the tax cuts for rich people in America. So reconciliation isn't something that's never been done before." We'll set aside some of the hypocrisy here (see Reid's comments in 2005 when he talked about the "arrogance of power" when Republicans were mulling reconciliation). Similarly, we'll set aside the hypocrisy of Republicans who used reconciliation in the past, but now denounce it. The issue we're looking at here is whether Republicans have really used reconciliation bills more than Democrats, as Reid claimed. On Nov. 14, 2008, the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service put out a report on reconciliation bills between 1981 and 2009. There have been 22 of them, including three that were vetoed by President Bill Clinton. It's been used for health insurance portability (COBRA), nursing home standards, expanded Medicaid eligibility, increases in the earned income tax credit, welfare reform, start-up of the state Children's Health Insurance Program, major tax cuts and student aid reform. While some have tallied the Republican vs. Democratic report card on reconciliation based on the president in power at the time, we think it makes more sense to look at the party in power in Congress when the reconciliation procedure was initiated. By our count, eight of the reconciliation bills were initiated by a Democratic-controlled Congress. The rest, 14, were done by a Republican-controlled Congress. So by that measure, Reid is on target. "It's a legitimate argument," said Thomas Mann, a senior fellow in governance studies at the Brookings Institution. "And Reid is absolutely right. It has been used a lot, and more by Republicans than Democrats." On April 20, 2009, Mann co-authored an article in the New Republic, "Truth and Reconciliation: Sidestepping the Filibuster," along with Molly Reynolds, also of Brookings, and Norman Ornstein, a resident scholar at the American Enterprise Institute, which concluded that "Health reform 2009 style would be the most ambitious use of reconciliation but it fits a pattern used over three decades by both parties to avoid the strictures of Senate filibusters." Still, we think looking at all 22 reconciliation bills casts too wide a net. Many reconciliation bills were not even all that controversial, and enjoyed wide bipartisan support. But other ones have clearly involved policy decisions that otherwise would likely have failed. Only eight involved votes where the winning side had less than the supermajority threshold of 60 votes. One could argue those were the times when Congress got around the need for the standard 60 votes. But even among that smaller group, six of the eight came courtesy of a Republican-controlled Congress. By way of counterpoint, Brian Darling, director of Senate relations at the conservative Heritage Foundation, argues that any comparison of past reconciliation bills to one on health care is flawed. "This is a unique situation," Darling said. "It's completely unprecedented to use reconciliation to amend a bill that is pending in Congress but has not passed." Darling called the Democrats' threat of reconciliation a measure of last resort to steamroll through a bill that can no longer get 60 votes in the Senate and is unpopular with the American public. Whether or not a reconciliation bill on health care meets the intent of the legislative procedure is certainly a matter for legitimate debate. But Reid said reconciliation has been used 21 times since 1981, and that most of the time, it's been Republicans who have initiated it. We find that there have been 22 reconciliation votes, 14 of them by a Republican-controlled Congress, and that it makes more sense -- in light of the debate over making an end-run around the 60-vote threshold -- to focus on the reconciliation bills that passed without a supermajority. But even then, Republicans have reached for reconciliation bills more often than Democrats since 1981. We rule Reid's comment True.

pomt-02446	Says Debo Adegbile "was nominated to serve as a judge on the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals" and "was abruptly withdrawn by the administration."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2014/feb/27/pat-toomey/pat-toomey-says-barack-obama-previously-nominated-/	President Barack Obama’s pick to head the Justice Department’s civil rights division has dredged up a decades old controversy surrounding Mumia Abu-Jamal, a black radical convicted of killing a Philadelphia police officer. Obama nominated Debo Adegbile to be an assistant attorney general in November. Adegbile previously served as director of litigation at the NAACP’s Legal Defense Fund. Sen. Pat Toomey, R-Pa., co-authored an op-ed in the Wall Street Journal with Philadelphia District Attorney R. Seth Williams on Feb. 24 that said Adegbile was not fit for the post because he attempted to "seize on (the Abu-Jamal) case and turn it into a political platform from which to launch an extreme attack on the justice system." In 1982, Abu-Jamal was found guilty of murdering a Philadelphia police officer in a case that garnered national attention. The case went on for many years. In 2009, Adegbile was at the NAACP Legal Defense Fund when it filed an amicus brief before the U.S. Supreme Court, arguing that Abu-Jamal’s sentence was invalid because the jury was racially biased. Later, Adegbile was one of several lawyers to represent Abu-Jamal when prosecutors tried to reinstate the death penalty. Abu-Jamal is serving a life sentence without parole. But it was Toomey’s final salvo calling on Adegbile to withdraw his nomination that caught our attention. "Only three years ago, Mr. Adegbile was nominated to serve as a judge on the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. Months later that nomination was abruptly withdrawn by the administration. That would be the best course here." At PolitiFact, we won’t debate Adegbile’s credentials for this important position, nor weigh in on a decades-old controversy. But whether Adegbile was previously nominated by Obama for a position is something we can, and will, look at. Nominate vs. consider We perused through the record of presidential nominations. Adegbile’s name doesn’t appear prior to his most recent nomination to the Justice Department. So we then turned to Toomey’s office. They immediately conceded their error. "We should have written that he was under consideration," said Elizabeth Anderson, a spokeswoman for Toomey’s office. "He was not nominated." Presidents consider nominees all the time. Some considerations are more public than others. Former United Nations ambassador Susan Rice, for example, was publicly "considered" to be the secretary of state by Obama, but her name was never formally submitted for nomination after Republicans lined up against her. In the case of Adegbile, the Washington Post reported in 2011 that Obama "asked the American Bar Association to evaluate the credentials of Debo Patrick Adegbile, director of litigation for the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund Inc., for a seat on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit." More recently, the Los Angeles Times reported that "Florida lawyer Ben Hill, who was chairman of the bar association committee, said in an interview that Adegbile's name was withdrawn before he was rated by the group." Senate Republicans on the Judiciary Committee asked Adegbile this year why his name was withdrawn in 2011. Responding to a question submitted by Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, the ranking Republican on the Senate Judiciary Committee, Adegbile wrote: "I withdrew myself from consideration for a nomination to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit based upon my personal, professional and practical assessment that my family’s best interests were served by my decision to remain in my position at the NAACP LDF in New York at that time." In his op-ed with Williams, Toomey said Adegbile’s nomination was "abruptly withdrawn by the administration." But Adegbile contends it was his own doing. A spokesman for the White House also said Adegbile took himself out of the running. Toomey’s office pointed to a Washington Post story (which is actually a wire version of the aforementioned L.A. Times article) where it was reported that "the White House later withdrew his name." Finally, it’s worth noting that Obama has had a tough time filling U.S. Court of Appeals seats in the D.C. Circuit. It’s widely considered a stepping stone to the U.S. Supreme Court, and Republicans have repeatedly blocked his nominees. When the Senate Democrats invoked the so-called "nuclear option" to change Senate rules for confirming presidential appointments, it was to move ahead with three Obama appointees to the 12-member U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit. Adegbile’s confirmation for assistant attorney general now only needs a simple majority, which Democrats can arrange without help from Republicans. At the time he was being considered for the judgeship, Republicans could have forced a 60-vote threshold to confirm Adegbile’s nomination, if it reached that point. Our ruling Toomey, along with Williams, wrote that "Adegbile was nominated to serve as a judge on the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. Months later that nomination was abruptly withdrawn by the administration." Adegbile was never nominated, a point Toomey’s office conceded. He was considered for the job by Obama, but only briefly and not formally. Presidents considered many names before making an official nomination. The distinction is important, because having to pull a nomination after it's formally made is a less frequent occurrence and a more significant setback for an administration.

pomt-09158	"Almost 1 million children ... have no health insurance in this state."	true	/florida/statements/2010/jun/09/bud-chiles/bud-chiles-1-million-children-health-insurance/	Lawton "Bud" Chiles III, son of the late Gov. Lawton Chiles, announced his independent run for governor on June 3, 2010, by saying he'd be a voice for those who traditionally have been cut out of the democratic process. "I'm here to speak for 1 million Floridians who today are out of work, for almost 1 million children who have no health insurance in this state and for millions of Florida citizens like me, who believe that Florida can and must do better by its families and by its communities," Chiles said. Chiles, previously a registered Democrat, said he opted out of a Democratic primary with Chief Financial Officer Alex Sink after he spoke on the phone with Sink and she told him she plans to raise $30 million in the race. Sink denies using that figure. In this item, we wanted to check Chiles' claim that almost 1 million Florida children are without health insurance. The number is particularly surprising, given that the state operates a program called Florida KidCare, which provides free or heavily subsidized health insurance for many uninsured children under 19. To qualify for Florida KidCare you must be a U.S. citizen or an eligible non-U.S. Citizen (read the eligibility information here). The Florida Department of Health says that 1.8 million children are currently enrolled in the program. To begin to assess Chiles' figure we turned to the Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation, a group that analyzes health care policy. In October 2009, they produced a report called "The Uninsured, a Primer," which details the number of people insured and uninsured by race, gender, age and state. The report is based on Census information and averages 2007 and 2008 calculations to provide state-level data. Kaiser says the data comes with a margin of error between 5 and 7.9 percentage points. According to Kaiser, 18.3 percent of Florida's 4.3 million children under 19 are without health insurance, or about 787,000 children. Only Texas has a higher percentage of children uninsured, Kaiser found. Families USA, a national consumer health care group, said in an October 2008 study that 797,000 children in Florida were without health care (18.8 percent of all children). The study, like Kaiser's, relied on Census data and counted children under 19. Families USA found that over 60 percent of Florida’s uninsured children come from low-income families who likely are eligible for Florida KidCare. A third group, The Commonwealth Fund, found in a 2009 study that 18 percent of children 0-17 in Florida were without health insurance -- the highest percentage of children uninsured in the country. The Commonwealth Fund study did not attach a raw number like the Families USA and Kaiser surveys, but 18 percent is in the same range as the findings of the other two studies. In his announcement as a candidate for governor, Chiles said that almost 1 million children in Florida don't have health insurance. The most reliable and recent studies put the number at close to 800,000. Chiles uses the word "almost," which gives him some leeway. We rate his statement True.

pomt-06125	"Florida is considered the fourth-largest gambling state in the nation."	half-true	/florida/statements/2011/dec/27/ellyn-bogdanoff/ellyn-bogdanoff-said-florida-considered-fourth-lar/	Supporters of a proposed bill that would allow three massive destination casino resorts in South Florida often argue that gambling is already a big business here -- in fact, one of the largest in the country. "Florida is considered the fourth-largest gambling state in the nation, but it has let the industry drive policy decisions and that has produced the worst kind of gaming,'' Sen. Ellyn Bogdanoff, R-Fort Lauderdale, said in an October 2011 interview about her casinos bill. "To me, no kind of gaming is good, but we as policymakers have to decide, do we want gaming with five-star hotels or Internet cafes in strip malls?" That fourth-largest ranking claim has been repeated multiple times by Bogdanoff, including in a joint editorial with state Rep. Erik Fresen, R-Miami, and by other individuals, including former U.S. Rep. Lincoln Diaz-Balart. Diaz-Balart is a lawyer and adviser for the Genting Group, which has purchased the waterfront Miami Herald property with plans to build a mega casino-resort there. We wondered if the ranking is true. The roots of the claim Bogdanoff's legislative assistant, Aaron Nevins, told us that the source of her claim came from a Oct. 24, 2011, report by Bernstein Research, a leading watcher of gambling stocks. "Florida has more gaming options than Las Vegas," the report states. "There is currently $3.4B of gaming occurring in Florida or $7.4B if one includes the lottery ... There are 8 casinos in the state run by Native Americans. Seven of these are Seminole and one is Miccosukee. These casinos generated revenues of just over $2B in 2009, making Florida the fourth largest state for tribal gaming...." Setting aside the numbers for a second, the Bernstein report makes clear it is discussing tribal gaming not gaming overall in that section, a distinction not made by Bogdanoff. "She misspoke," Nevins told PolitiFact in a Dec. 20 interview. "Florida is the fourth-largest state for tribal gaming." Other measures, rankings What else is out there? We asked Nevins if there were any other sources that ranked states' gambling revenues -- and he quickly found a separate report about states' gambling revenues in fiscal year 2010 by the Nelson A. Rockefeller Institute of Government, a group that describes itself as the public policy research arm of the State University of New York. According to the Rockefeller report, 43 states operate lotteries, 15 allow commercial casinos, 12 have racinos, and over 40 states allow pari-mutuel wagering. Lotteries and casinos generate the bulk of gambling-related revenues. The report on Page 5 compares states' revenues from lotteries, casinos, racinos and traditional pari-mutuel wagering. In Florida, revenues totaled about $1.4 billion -- ranking the state third behind New York and Pennsylvania. The group also found that -- in the states where data was available -- Florida ranked third in Native American casino revenues, behind California and Connecticut. (A brief pit stop here to explain why the Bernstein and Rockefeller reports were billions apart on their Florida figures. The Rockefeller report cited about $1.25 billion for the lottery, which is the amount that went to the state's Education Enhancement Trust Fund, while Bernstein cited total lottery revenues of about $4 billion. Those figures can be seen in this chart on page 117 from Florida's Department of Economic and Demographic Research.) Now, back to the Rockefeller chart showing Florida at No. 3. How could Florida be ahead of Nevada, which had $829.3 million in revenues, placing at No. 12? This chart looks at gambling revenues from four sources -- lotteries, casinos, racinos and pari-mutuel wagering -- combined. Nevada only has one category here -- casinos -- while Florida has the lottery, racinos (race tracks with slot machines) and pari-mutuel wagering. But let's take a look at a few other charts in the Rockefeller report that examine states' gambling rankings in various ways: * States' reliance on gambling revenues: In fiscal year 2009, Florida was 15th at 3.3 percent. Nevada -- at 12.5 percent -- had the highest percentage of gambling revenue as a share of the state's own-source revenue. * States' share of nationwide gambling revenues: Florida was third at 5.8 percent behind New York and Pennsylvania for fiscal year 2010. * Gambling revenue per resident 18 & above: Florida was 21st at $94.4. Rhode Island was No. 1. * Gambling revenue as a percentage of personal income: Florida was 19th at 0.2 percent. West Virginia was No. 1. And there are even more charts in the report that compare gambling revenues between 2009 and 2010 and zero in on single sources of gambling such as racinos. But you get the picture -- each measure of gambling can result in a different state being the top, second or fourth. And we'll toss in one more source of state-by-state comparisons. We found a ranking of states related to commercial casino activity from the American Gaming Association's 2011 state of the states survey. For example, on state-by-state consumer spending, or gross gaming revenue -- what a casino earns before it pays taxes, salaries or other expenses, Florida ranked 16th in the country. On tax revenue, Florida ranked 15th. (The AGA is focused here on its definition of commercial casinos, which includes racinos -- but note these rankings don't reflect tribal establishments or the lottery.) And if you guessed Nevada as No. 1 for commercial casino tax revenue you'd be wrong -- Pennsylvania and Indiana were higher. How could Indiana be higher than Nevada? "Indiana ranks higher than Nevada because, while its gross gaming revenue is lower than Nevada, its tax rate is much higher, yielding a larger tax contribution from commercial casinos in the state," said Holly Wetzel, spokeswoman for the association. Check out this article from Stateline.org, a publication of the Pew Center on the States: "Nevada can still lay claim to being the nation’s leading casino state, with a total take of $10.4 billion last year, but casino revenue and casino tax revenue are two very different things. State tax policies for casinos vary widely. Tax rates often are higher for casinos located at racetracks, sometimes called 'racinos,' where the slot machines tend to be operated by the state lottery as opposed to the more traditional state regulatory gaming commission." What's the best source? So is there a preferred way to compare states to conclude which one is the largest, or fourth-largest, gambling state in the nation? Does it all depend on what point you want to make or what you are looking at? We posed those questions to experts in the industry as well as academics. Wetzel, of AGA, told us in an interview: "I don't think there is a right or wrong or agreed-upon way to measure it. It depends upon what question you are asking." Wetzel said most firms comparing markets look at gross gaming revenues -- what a casino earns before it pays taxes, salaries or other expenses. It can also be useful to look at tax contributions -- but there are different tax rates in various states. "You can slice it and dice it anyway you want to depending on what story you are wanting to get at," Wetzel said. "The way we rank it is gross gaming revenue." Lucy Dadayan, one of the authors on the Rockefeller report, agreed with Bogdanoff that gambling is already in Florida in a big way. "However, the statement by the senator isn’t made in terms of reliance on gambling, or on any adjusted basis," Dadayan told PolitiFact Florida in an e-mail. "So total gambling expenditures (which we don’t collect) is the best measure in that regard. From the figures we collect, I’d say total gambling revenues to the state are the most useful measure, and Florida is in the 3rd place by this measure. The choice of the measure is really dependent on the purpose of the comparison." Dean Gerstein, principal investigator for an in-depth gambling study done for the federal government in 1999 and now vice provost and professor at Claremont Graduate University, said the best measure depends on the point a person is trying to make. "A measure is a statistical construct designed to best match the concept you have in mind. If the concept is the sheer size of an industry, then total revenues/sales is the usual metric," Gerstein said. "If it is the significance of the industry to the 'local' economy, it is the industry’s local wages plus locally retained profits (including the tax rake) generated, as a percentage of local wage/profit retention/tax. "If you are interested in gambling by residents, you want to know how much the local residents gamble away per capita, regardless of where they do so. Hence all the CA residents who trek to Vegas are exporting money. But all the multinational corporations that own Vegas casinos are exporting profits. The preferred stat depends on what you are interested in, and it is important to think straight about this. Note that the states with the largest populations — CA, TX, NY, FL — tend to dominate any stat that is based in some part on total population, while Nevada and other small-pop mountain states will be down in the weeds. When you put population in the denominator (that is, 'per capita'), that changes things." Our ruling As Bogdanoff introduced her casino bill she said: "Florida is considered the fourth-largest gambling state in the nation..." But this isn't as simple as college football rankings. There isn't one universally accepted measure. Now, Bogdanoff's legislative assistant acknowledges she should have specified tribal gaming. But that said, Bogdanoff's broader point is certainly supported from the majority of research, which suggests that -- if you include the state lottery -- Florida is certainly a big gambling state. No. 4? That's a lot less clear and very much dependent on what you measure and how you measure it. On balance, we rate this claim Half True.

pomt-07313	The Massachusetts health care plan is "wildly unpopular" among state residents.	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/may/16/laura-ingraham/laura-ingraham-says-massachusetts-health-plan-wild/	On the May 12, 2011, edition of the Fox News Channel's’ O’Reilly Factor, host Bill O’Reilly and conservative commentator Laura Ingraham discussed a speech on health care given earlier that day by possible Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney. Romney’s speech was designed to draw distinctions between the Massachusetts health care plan passed when he was governor and the national health care law signed in 2010. In a separate item, we analyzed whether Romney was justified in calling the national law a "government takeover." Here, we’ll look at a comment Ingraham made regarding in-state public opinion about the Massachusetts plan. "Look, I like Mitt Romney," Ingraham said. "I think he's a really smart guy, and I think he would be a good president. ... On this, I don't get it, though, Bill. I mean, costs have gone up. It's wildly unpopular." We wondered whether the Massachusetts system was in fact "wildly unpopular" with Bay State residents. We found two polls that shed light on this question to one degree or another. One was conducted in early April 2011 by Suffolk University of 500 Massachusetts residents. In response to the question, "Do you think health care in Massachusetts is working?" the poll found that 38 percent said yes, 49 percent said no, and 13 percent were undecided. This would seem to provide a measure of support for Ingraham’s claim. However, the question was phrased more broadly than Ingraham’s claim because it referred to "health care in Masschusetts," which could include factors well beyond the state health plan, such as their own personal experiences with the specific doctors, hospitals and pharmacists they use. And even if the results were a direct commentary on support for the Massachusetts system, a split of 38 percent in favor and 49 percent against doesn’t indicate the state health care law is "wildly unpopular," as Ingraham said. Unpopular, perhaps, but not necessarily "wildly" so. A more appropriate yardstick for measuring the plan’s popularity is a survey taken by the Harvard School of Public Health with the Boston Globe in mid September 2009. Here are two questions that most directly address Ingraham’s claim. Both were asked of the 467 respondents who told the pollsters that they were aware of the law: Given what you know about it, in general, do you support or oppose the Massachusetts Universal Health Insurance Law? Support: 59 percent Oppose: 28 percent Don’t Know: 13 percent Do you think the Massachusetts Health Insurance Reform Law should be repealed, continued as the law currently stands, or continued but with some changes made? Repealed: 11 percent Continued as the law currently stands: 22 percent Continued but with some changes made: 57 percent Don’t know: 10 percent The first question found residents support the law by more than a two-to-one margin. The second demonstrated that residents were not entirely satisfied with all of the law’s provisions, but it did show that support for outright repeal was low -- only 11 percent. A major caveat to the Harvard poll is that it was taken a year and a half ago, and sentiment may have changed since then. (Support for the law did drop by about 10 points compared to a 2008 Harvard poll.) Still, the Harvard data, despite being older, directly addresses Ingraham’s claim and indicates she was wrong. "The statement about the plan being ‘wildly unpopular’ is unfounded given available polling data," said Robert Blendon, the Harvard researcher who helped do the poll. As for the newer poll, David Paleologos, who directed the poll in question, said the question has value, while acknowledging that it is broader in focus. "It’s a snapshot of how people feel currently about Massachusetts health care," he said. "I think that’s all we can garner from the question. … Unless questions are identically worded, a lot of the comparison is left open to one’s opinion." On the advice of experts, we decided not to consider a recent customer satisfaction survey commissioned by the government agency that runs the state health insurance exchange created under the law. That study found that 84 percent of participants in the Commonwealth Care program rated it 4 or 5 on a five-point satisfaction scale, while only 4 percent said they were dissatisfied. Some news accounts mistakenly reported that this was a poll of all Massachusetts residents, but it wasn't, so we don't believe that it's a valid yardstick for assessing Ingraham's comment. We should note that an estimated 400,000 Massachusetts residents -- or only about 6 percent of people living in the state -- have secured health coverage as a direct result of the law, according to the Blue Cross Blue Shield Foundation of Massachusetts. That has enabled 98.1 percent of Massachusetts residents to secure insurance -- the highest rate of any state. But that also means that the impact of the law has been indirect for more than 9 of 10 Massachusetts residents. Residents need to include a certificate of insurance when they file their taxes. More important, but less tangibly, they may find their insurance costs or their taxes going up due to how the law has reshaped the insurance market. And there is evidence that the increase in number of insured residents in the state has put pressure on primary care physicians, potentially leading to longer waits for service. Still, one Massachusetts political analyst, Tufts University political scientist Jeffrey Berry, said he didn’t detect a groundswell of opposition to the law among residents. "Massachusetts voters, like voters everywhere, are unhappy with rising health care costs," Berry said. "They see that in their insurance premiums -- every paycheck and every year, the rates go up. The reform for the uninsured passed during the Romney administration is, itself, largely invisible. People know it's there but don't know how it's working (or, unless they're on it, don't know how it works). There's very little press coverage of the program. In Massachusetts there is simply no controversy about the plan at this point. Most telling is that there is no real organized opposition to it and no effort in the state legislature to revise it." Berry concludes that Ingraham’s "wildly unpopular" claim is "wildly exaggerated." Additional data from the Harvard poll supports Berry’s sense that it’s actually apathy -- rather than opposition -- that’s shaping views of the Massachusetts plan. The pollsters asked, "Generally speaking, do you think this health insurance law is helping, hurting, or not having much of an impact on the quality of your health care, the cost of your health care and your ability to pay medical bills if you were to get sick." Here are the results: • On quality, 23 percent said the law was "helping," 14 percent said "hurting," and 55 percent said it was "not having much of an impact." • On cost, 19 percent said it was helping, 24 percent said it was hurting and 47 percent said it wasn’t having much impact. • And on people’s ability to pay their medical bills, 24 percent said it was helping, 14 percent said it was hurting and 53 percent said it wasn’t making much difference. In other words, for each of these three issues, either a majority or a plurality of respondents said the law wasn’t having a significant impact. So where does this leave us? The Harvard data contradicts Ingraham’s argument, showing a fair amount of support for the law in general alongside feelings that it’s not doing much for them personally. The Suffolk poll is more recent, but the question asked is too broad to speak directly to Ingraham’s claim. And we couldn't find any other support for Ingraham's claim. So we rate Ingraham’s statement False.	None	Laura Ingraham	None	None	None	2011-05-16T14:47:26	2011-05-12	['Massachusetts']

pomt-07514	"I have the No. 1 show on NBC."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/apr/08/donald-trump/donald-trump-says-his-show-no-1-nbc-he-right/	No one ever accused Donald Trump of being modest. So when he was asked in a combative Today show interview when he would formally announce a campaign for president, the tycoon said he was being respectful of NBC. After all, Trump said, his show The Celebrity Apprentice is the network's top-rated show. Here's the exchange with Today host Meredith Vieira: Vieira: "What are you waiting for?" Trump: "I hate to say it, I have the No. 1 show on NBC. Is that a correct statement? I mean, The Apprentice is doing great -- The Celebrity Apprentice." Vieira: "What does that have to do...." Trump: "It has a lot to do. It sounds so trivial, and I hate to even bring it up, but I'm not allowed to run during the show. You're not allowed to have the show on and be a declared candidate. It’s a great show and it’s got phenomenal ratings, and until that show is over, I can’t declare, because otherwise, NBC would have to take the show off the air, and I think that would be very unfair to NBC." This season's Celebrity Apprentice is the latest in a long-running NBC reality show that features celebrities ranging from a country singer to a Playmate of the Year competing in a series of challenges that include creating a children's book and selling pizzas. At the end of each show, one of them gets fired by Trump. So how do the ratings look? It depends whether you're referring to recent weeks or to the entire season. If you look at the most recent week’s Nielsen ratings, Trump is right. For the week ending April 3, 2011, The Celebrity Apprentice ranked higher than any NBC prime time broadcast show among adults age 18-49 -- the coveted demographic for television executives. We should note that the bar is pretty low to be the highest-rated NBC show these days. When you consider shows on all broadcast networks that week, The Celebrity Apprentice ranked 15th. And The Celebrity Apprentice was the only NBC show to rank in the top 22 -- behind 10 from CBS, eight from ABC and three from Fox. We’ll also note that for the previous week -- the one ending March 27 -- The Celebrity Apprentice finished third on NBC and 19th overall. Still, Trump's right for the most recent ratings. For the entire season, however, The Celebrity Apprentice is not the top-rated NBC show. Marc Berman, a senior television editor at AdWeek, provided us with the average Nielsen ratings for all 160 broadcast network shows between Sept. 20, 2010, and April 3, 2011 -- basically, the entire season to date. Here’s how the top NBC shows stack up for the 18-to-49 demographic: 1. Sunday Night Football (3rd overall) 2. Football Night in America pregame show (tied for 17th overall) 3. The Office (tied for 17th overall) 4. The Biggest Loser (tied for 34th overall) 5. The Celebrity Apprentice (tied for 36th overall) And here are the numbers for all ages: 1. Sunday Night Football (4th overall) 2. Harry’s Law (29th overall) 3. Football Night in America pregame show (33rd overall) 4. Law & Order L.A. (42nd overall) 5. The Celebrity Apprentice (44th overall) So in both categories, The Celebrity Apprentice ranks fifth behind a mix of scripted dramas, sitcoms, reality shows and Sunday football. By this standard, Trump is wrong to say he has "the No. 1 on NBC." "It’s misleading," Berman said. "His show is doing well for NBC, but it’s not the No. 1." So Trump's boast needs some context. He's right for the most recent ratings, but not for the season overall. We find his claim Half True.	None	Donald Trump	None	None	None	2011-04-08T14:09:38	2011-04-07	['None']
pomt-01140	"The reason why Cubans don't have access to 21st century telecommunications — like smart phones, like access to the Internet — is because it is illegal in Cuba."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2014/dec/19/marco-rubio/marco-rubio-says-castros-not-embargo-reason-cubans/	There’s a good chance most Cubans won’t be able to read this article. And the reason why — lack of Internet access — is a point of a contention between President Barack Obama and Republican Sen. Marco Rubio. Obama on Wednesday, Dec. 17 announced sweeping changes to the United States’ decades-old isolation policy against Cuba, promising renewed diplomatic relations and an easing of regulations on commerce. Obama said the drastic shift in approach to the Communist-controlled island would help bolster the Cuban people, who he said have suffered from America’s cold shoulder. "I believe in the free flow of information," Obama said. "Unfortunately, our sanctions on Cuba have denied Cubans access to technology that has empowered individuals around the globe." Rubio, a Florida Republican and a Cuban American, chastised Obama’s comments in an animated rebuttal. "The president said that the people of Cuba do not have access to advanced, 21st century modern technology for communications and telecommunications because of the U.S. embargo. That is false," Rubio said. "The reason why they don't have access to 21st century telecommunications — like smart phones, like access to the Internet — is because it is illegal in Cuba." Obama’s statement wasn’t as full-throated as Rubio made it sound. And some of what Obama suggested is true, experts told us. That said, Rubio has the better part of the argument that Cuba’s restrictive policies loom large over the debate. Cuba’s restrictions Cuba has less access to the Internet than most countries in the world. It is the only country in the Western Hemisphere with an Internet access rating of "not free" by Freedom House, a human rights advocacy group. Citing the National Statistics Office in Cuba, Freedom House said about 23 percent of Cubans have access to the Internet. But those numbers, while very low, are likely inflated: Many of those people have access only to a tightly controlled Cuban intranet that includes email and government-approved sites. Outside experts, Freedom House said, estimate only about 5 percent of people have access to the full World Wide Web. The government of Cuba maintains almost complete control over telecommunications industries in the country, and it uses a mix of repressive policies and price gouging to keep Cubans offline. Regulations essentially prohibit private Internet use in homes and it is illegal to access the Internet outside government-controlled methods. On top of that, the cost of even a basic computer is more than twice the average Cuban’s annual salary. Cubans who log on to the Internet do so via public, government-run access points. There, patrons deal with some of the slowest speeds in the world. And rates set by the government make it difficult for the average worker on a $20 weekly salary to consistently log on. Checking email costs $1.50 an hour. Access to the national intranet is $0.60 per hour, and international websites are $4.50 per hour, Freedom House said. Bloggers and dissenters are quickly shut down and, in many cases, imprisoned. Alan Gross, the imprisoned American contractor released by Cuba this week, was arrested for building telecommunications infrastructure on the island. As for smartphones, most mobile phones can send messages, even internationally, but cannot access the Internet. GPS and satellite capabilities are prohibited. An iPhone, if procured, would be a pretty dumb phone in Cuba. Cuban officials have recently indicated a potential shift in policy that could open the Internet to personal and mobile usage, but it’s also possible it will be limited to Cuba’s intranet and email. Such promises have been made before. Cuba installed a 1,600 kilometer fiber-optic cable between the island and Venezuela in 2011 with financial help from China (a project completed despite the U.S. embargo, it should be noted). It was supposed to increase speeds and access for Cubans. Actual advances have been modest. And it’s not as though the United States is the only country capable of supplying Cuba with telecommunications technology in today’s global economy. The regime has prioritized preventing political dissent over technological advancement. There’s no guarantee that will change if U.S. policy does. This is why Rubio is right in saying that the U.S. embargo is far from the only factor affecting access. Sure, Cuba is poor and has bad infrastructure, but there are poorer countries with better Internet access, said Larry Press, an information systems professor at California State University Dominguez Hills who writes a blog on Internet access in Cuba. When infrastructure improved in Cuba, access largely did not. "I think Rubio is closer to the truth than Obama," Press said. "Both have a degree of truth, but the Cuban government's fear of the Internet was a bigger hindrance than the embargo." The embargo effect Rubio was not quite right, however, when he said that Obama’s comment was unequivocally false. Obama said that U.S. sanctions on Cuba "have denied Cubans access to technology." This is true to a certain extent. Part of Cubans’ access problem has to do with the exorbitant cost of technology, relative to how poor the country is, and lifting those restrictions could help that problem. In 2009, Obama cracked the door open marginally for American telecommunications companies to operate in Cuba by allowing them to establish connectivity between Cuba and the United States, and letting satellite radio and television companies serve Cuban customers. Additionally, people could donate (but not sell) telecommunication devices like computers and phones to Cubans. The changes announced Dec. 17 further opened up the ability for U.S. companies to build telecommunications infrastructure in Cuba and it allows for the commercial sale of communication devices and software. Matt Borman, deputy assistant secretary of export administration, told PolitiFact that if American companies were able to compete with other foreign telecommunications suppliers in Cuba, there is an expectation that it would pressure the government to create more viable infrastructure. That could spur more Internet freedom. In a report published in 2010, the Brookings Institution made a similar argument. A of couple experts told us that Obama’s side carries weight because Castro has made an effort in recent years to ease some restrictions, such as lifting the ban on personal computers. (It may be hard to believe, but internet access in Cuba used to be even worse.) So the United States’ sanctions prevent Cubans from acquiring technology that is now legal, said Julia Sweig, an expert on Cuba and Latin America at the Council on Foreign Relations. Our ruling Rubio said that rather than the U.S. embargo, the reason why Cubans "don't have access to 21st century telecommunications — like smart phones, like access to the Internet — is because it is illegal in Cuba." "Illegal" is probably the wrong word. There are some ways to legally access the Internet in Cuba, but not in one's home, or on mobile devices, and not by connecting to the full World Wide Web. Internet use is primarily restricted to government-run access points that are heavily monitored. The usage rates, set by the regime, are so expensive that it is cost prohibitive for most Cubans to log on. Political dissenters are barred from publishing online and are punished if they do. The end result is similar to full prohibition: Cuba has one of the lowest rates of Internet access in the world. The U.S. sanctions have played a role in limited availability of technology. However, Rubio is right that the Cuban government has nearly complete control over the Internet. That isn’t a result of sanctions on telecommunication business activity in Cuba. Even if the United States fully repeals its embargo, government control over Internet access could continue. We rate Rubio’s statement Mostly True.

pomt-13824	"We flood communities with so many guns that it is easier for a teenager to buy a Glock than get his hands on a computer or even a book."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/jul/14/barack-obama/barack-obama-offers-flawed-comparison-between-teen/	President Barack Obama attracted attention for a bold assertion about how easy it is to obtain a gun during his speech at an interfaith memorial service for five officers slain by a sniper in Dallas, Texas. "As a society, we choose to underinvest in decent schools," he said. "We allow poverty to fester so that entire neighborhoods offer no prospect for gainful employment. We refuse to fund drug treatment and mental health programs. We flood communities with so many guns that it is easier for a teenager to buy a Glock than get his hands on a computer or even a book, and then we tell the police, ‘You’re a social worker, you’re the parent, you’re the teacher, you’re the drug counselor.’" Critics pounced on the Glock remark, saying Obama was making a misleading — or even outright false — comparison. But the White House said it had evidence to back up Obama’s line. So we decided to take our own look. What the White House says The White House offered PolitiFact several news reports to back up Obama’s case. The gist of these reports was that there are lots of guns to be found in low-income urban areas, but comparatively few books and relatively little access to the Internet. However, much of the evidence these articles provided was anecdotal, and none of the articles directly compared guns to computers or books --- not to mention Glocks, the specific make of handgun Obama cited. And none of the articles offered a rigorous academic comparison of the specific claim Obama made. For example: • One study by New York University researchers found a scarcity of children’s books in low-income areas of Detroit, Los Angeles and Washington. But the study looked at stores that sold books without taking into account public libraries or school libraries, which make obtaining books easier. More importantly, the study didn’t compare the availability of guns. • Several articles offered quotes by people familiar with low-income communities that included observations similar to what Obama said in Dallas. For instance, one Chicago resident told Al Jazeera America that getting a gun in her neighborhood is as easy as buying a pack of gum. "If you want a gun, you can just go get a gun," she said. "You got the money? You can get a gun." And D. Watkins, a young, African-American writer from Baltimore who wrote The Beast Side: Living and Dying While Black in America, told public radio host Terry Gross that he bought his first gun "from some dudes in the neighborhood that sold guns. It was simple. ... (It was) Business as usual. And it's still like that." None of these accounts offered a direct comparison of guns’ availability compared with books or Internet access. • One link referenced an academic study about a lack of access to food in low-income areas, but it did not address either guns or books. • A news report cited research about the relative lack of Internet access in low-income households. But another article the White House provided said that while teens in families making less than $50,000 a year are less likely to have access to a desktop or a laptop computer than teens in higher income groups, the rate even for the lower-income group is still pretty high: All told, eight of every 10 of these lower-income teens had access to a computer. In all, we find the White House’s evidence unpersuasive on Obama’s specific claim. There’s no hard data making his comparison. And on the question of access to computers, we found data showing a relatively high rate of Internet access even among lower-income teens. Problems with the comparisons We considered the meaning of Obama’s remark a few different ways — but none provide a slam dunk for his argument. He said it was easier for a teen to obtain a Glock over a book or a computer. It might be easier for some people in some places, but it’s still against the law. "It is already against federal law for someone under the age of 21 to buy a handgun, such as a Glock, from a licensed firearms dealer," said John R. Lott, Jr., president of the generally pro-gun Crime Prevention Research Center. And federal law on handguns also makes it unlawful for anyone "to sell, deliver, or otherwise transfer (a handgun) to a person who the transferor knows or has reasonable cause to believe is a juvenile" — that is, under 18. That means that any teen would have to break the law to make such a purchase. Alternately, they could barter for a handgun or steal one, which might be practical but would also be against the law. So let’s now consider the case of teens who are willing to break the law. One interpretation is whether a gun is cheaper to get than a book. Experts said the price of a "street" handgun can range between $50 and $500, depending on the local vagaries of supply and demand. Glocks in particular "are very expensive," said Alan Lizotte, a criminal justice professor at the University at Albany. Street Glocks without a criminal history would be especially tough, he said. That would make them easily more expensive than books purchased at a store, and certainly more expensive than books borrowed for free from a library. "There are 80 public libraries in Chicago and 95 public high schools and 92 private high schools in the city," Lott said. The second interpretation of Obama’s remark is the ease, or accessibility, of locating a gun. This is perhaps the most favorable interpretation for Obama, since credible research shows that there’s both a relative shortage of books and a relative surplus of guns in low-income neighborhoods. But it’s worth remembering that there don’t appear to be any studies that compare books and guns directly. In addition, there’s a lot of variation, neighborhood by neighborhood, across the country. "If there’s lots of street-gang activity where you live, you may know someone who can get you a gun," said James Alan Fox, interim director of the School of Criminology and Criminal Justice at Northeastern University. "If you live in a middle- or upper-middle class suburb, a gun may not be as accessible for a teenager. I wouldn’t know who to ask to buy a street gun." Some points for Obama Experts acknowledged, though, that Obama had a point with his remark, even if he made an imperfect comparison. "It is pretty easy for a teen to get a handgun at little cost and very quickly, at least in some places, including urban places," Lizotte said. That said, Jay Corzine, a sociologist and gun-policy expert at the University of Central Florida, called Obama’s framing "weird." "The most credit I can give the president is that the statement may be true in a very small number of cases that are dependent on the context -- location, day of the week, time of the day, cash in hand," Corzine said. Our ruling Obama said, "We flood communities with so many guns that it is easier for a teenager to buy a Glock than get his hands on a computer or even a book." There’s little doubt that in some lower-income and high-crime neighborhoods, it is strikingly easy for even teens to acquire a handgun. On this, there is ample anecdotal evidence. But buying a gun is not likely to be cheaper than buying -- or borrowing -- a book or securing access to a computer, even for teens in poor neighborhoods. On multiple levels, Obama’s comparison is flawed. We rate it Mostly False. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/08198a52-ac06-472b-8b7e-c51e47432be3	None	Barack Obama	None	None	None	2016-07-14T17:41:51	2016-07-12	['None']

pomt-12531	"The Wawa Welcome America festival (features) . . . America's largest free concert."	pants on fire!	/pennsylvania/statements/2017/apr/21/wawa-welcome-america/pants-fire/	On April 13, Wawa, Inc. and Welcome America, Inc., a nonprofit in partnership with the City of Philadelphia, sent out a press release to announce Wawa’s continued commitment to hosting Wawa Welcome America, Philadelphia’s Fourth of July festival. Wawa confirmed it will continue to host the 25-year-old celebration through 2019. The citywide, six-day festival includes fireworks, free museum admission and what the press release claims to be the largest free public concert in the country: "The Wawa Welcome America festival is the nation’s signature July 4th celebration in the birthplace of our nation. This multi-day, citywide festival features all FREE events such as America’s largest free concert, some of the nation’s largest fireworks displays, outdoor movie screenings, free museum days, neighborhood events and more." Last year’s celebration peaked at around 25,000, but that number accounts for the whole day’s worth of activities at Benjamin Franklin Parkway, from noon until the fireworks, which begin after the concert ends at 10 p.m. The attendance for the concert, which began at 5 p.m., dwindled last year to 6,500 due to escalating rainfall. Generally, Wawa Welcome America does attract a significantly bigger audience. In 2015, Philly.com reported that city officials estimated the crowd at the concert to be upwards of 175,000, with the full day’s attendance reaching 700,000 people. The lineup that year, curated by Philly native sons The Roots, snagged headliners Nicki Minaj and Ed Sheeran, as well as Jennifer Hudson. 175,000 people still isn’t the highest attendance at a free concert, though. Millions came out to celebrate the new millennium in Times Square’s New Year’s Eve bash in 2000. Each of President Obama’s inauguration events (with entertainment provided by Aretha Franklin in 2009 and Beyoncé in 2013) drew over a million people — in 2009 it was closer to two million. And, at the same time as Wawa Welcome America, there’s the July Fourth concert at the Capitol; last year the headliners of that, which also runs live on PBS and NPR, included country stars Gavin Degraw and Cassadee Pope, as well as Christopher Jackson, who played George Washington in the Broadway hit "Hamilton." The year before, Hunter Hayes and KC and the Sunshine Band led up to headliner Barry Manilow. All of these are free events — though some of them aren’t centered around the performances, like the presidential inaugurations — that include concerts that are free and open to the public. They fit the description. Melanie Sole, a spokesperson for Welcome America, explained it’s pretty difficult to accurately compare crowd sizes from events in different cities because "every city counts things differently and there are many factors to be aware of when comparing city to city." Crowd size estimates also tend to have political- and business-related biases. A prime example is the Trump administration’s claim that the president’s inauguration crowd was much larger than it appeared to be in aerial photos. Because of common biases and inaccuracies often involved in measuring crowds, Digital Design and Imaging Services markets itself as being able to provide an "accurate, defensible crowd count." Specialists there have offered crowd size estimates for major events in Washington D.C. like the recent Women’s March and Jon Stewart and Stephen Colbert’s 2010 Rally to Restore Sanity and/or Fear, which DDIS estimated drew 215,000 people, claiming only a 10 percent margin of error. The specialists at DDIS are able to provide some of the most accurate estimations of crowd size partly because of a kind of technology they developed themselves called a balloon test, which isn’t an actual balloon, but a ten inch orb tethered to float above a crowd and use laser rangefinders to scan the area. The Federal Aviation Administration bans flying helicopters over large gatherings for safety purposes, so without a balloon test it’s difficult to get a good aerial view for a measurement tool. Even without use of the DDIS’s resources, to get an even close to accurate estimate, "you must have high resolution photos, you must have orthographic views, and you must have lingering resources to determine a peak [in attendance]," President of DDIS Curt Westergard explained. It’s not an easy measurement to get correct. Inaccurate counts can lead not only to dangerous situations regarding people in the crowds getting swift access to resources in emergency situations, but also make comparing sizes at different events extremely difficult. "We make our comparisons to other publicly reported data by other Independence Day concerts plus review available data from the music industry and other sources," Sole said of Welcome America’s crowd size estimations. She added, "No other free Independence Day concert in America makes our claim nor has sought trademarks as ‘America’s Free Largest Independence Day Concert.’ There may be other data not publicly available or known to us." Even assuming the estimations Welcome America is relying on are accurate, 175,000 people definitely isn’t the largest free concert audience in the United States, as shown above. Concerts at inauguration events and New Year’s Eve celebrations regularly top that count. In a separate email, Sole added quite a few more qualifiers to the initial statement, asserting that the Wawa Welcome America concert is the "longest, diverse, inclusive, free, live concert event on July 4th—Independence Day." Even restricting the comparison to that day, Philadelphia’s concert still isn’t the biggest. Washington, D.C.’s concert has drawn up to 250,000 people in past years, reports The Washington Times. Though the National Park Service no longer provides a count, the Metro system, which provides estimates of crowd sizes by measuring the amount of people using transit, said their count reached 500,000 for 2013’s celebration. Sole also provided a list of additional criteria Welcome America uses to distinguish its event as the biggest nationwide: • The Parkway is one continuous space with unobstructed views from Love Park to the Main stage for one, continuous, live concert experience. The Parkway can accommodate a range of crowds compared to other venues in other cities that may have multiple "official" sites. • Factors in the counting of attendees--over time--include the timing of the Parkway pre-concert entertainment, the length of the live concert, diversity of performers, audience appeal, fireworks timing, weather and other factors (such as day of the week—this year July 4th is a Tuesday versus a long weekend or weekend day itself). • Review of Philly’s July 4th historical data and the Independence Day crowd estimates reported over time by the media and other sources along with visual evidence (such as pictures and videos). • We include live broadcast ratings and live streaming viewers. All portions of Philly’s events are live, never taped. However, none of these criteria were included in the original statement, which just claimed Wawa Welcome America features the largest free concert in the country-- not just on the Fourth of July and not based on the diversity of performers or the length of the live concert or whether the view of the stage is continually unobstructed. Today, Welcome America put out another announcement unveiling Mary J. Blige as the headliner for this year’s concert. This press release instead lauded the event as "America’s largest free Independence Day concert." Our ruling The original claim in Wawa and Welcome America’s press release stated Wawa Welcome America features America’s largest free concert. Welcome America Spokesperson later reiterated in an email that the organization measures a variety of factors including length of the concert, whether it’s live and whether there is an unobstructed view of the stage throughout the crowd. She also revised the initial claim and instead referred to the concert as the largest one in the US on Independence Day (which is still not totally accurate). Regardless, what we’re fact checking is the original statement from the press release. Philadelphia can certainly claim it has a pretty huge Independence Day celebration, but Wawa Welcome America is definitely not the largest free concert in the United States. We rate this claim as Pants on Fire.	None	Wawa Welcome America	None	None	None	2017-04-21T13:40:09	2017-04-13	['United_States']
pomt-04191	Social Security has not contributed to the debt and the deficits.	mostly false	/new-hampshire/statements/2012/dec/10/jeanne-shaheen/social-security-doesnt-contribute-national-debt-sa/	When it comes to the fiscal cliff, U.S. Sen. Jeanne Shaheen is willing to consider anything to ease the fall. Everything, that is, except for one key federal program. "I think we do need to take Social Security off the table because Social Security has not contributed to the debt and the deficits," Shaheen said Tuesday, Nov. 27 in an interview on MSNBC’s Jansing and Co. "We do need to fix it for the long-term," she said. "But that's a different discussion than the one that we're having about those programs that are actually costing." We’ve heard claims like this before. In August 2011, PolitiFact gave a Mostly True ruling to a claim that Social Security didn’t cause the debt crisis. At the same time, we ruled Mostly False on a claim that Social Security doesn’t contribute a penny to the deficit. We decided to take another swing at it. To start, we approached representatives from Shaheen’s Senate office, who reminded us that Social Security is a self-financed program, funded primarily through dedicated payroll taxes. In most years, including the period from 1984-2009, the program takes in more money than it distributes in benefits, creating a surplus. Those surplus dollars add to the Social Security trust funds, which currently hold about $2.7 trillion in assets. The two trust funds -- one dedicated to old age and survivors’ insurance and the other committed to disability insurance -- collect interest over time. And that interest only adds to the surplus, thereby reducing the deficit, according to Paul Van de Water, a senior fellow at the liberal Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. Including interest, the Social Security trust funds held a surplus of $69 billion in 2011, $68.6 billion in 2010 and $121.7 billion in 2009, according to Social Security Administration records. "To that extent, it’s actually reducing the overall federal deficit," Van de Water said. But, other analysts argue the interest payments earned by Social Security only amount to a re-shuffling of government dollars. As noted in the prior PolitiFact rulings, the Social Security trust funds may be considered separate, but, in reality, they are not "locked boxes" or closed-off savings accounts. Rather, Social Security is required by law to put its entire surplus into interest-earning government bonds. The dollars invested in Treasury bonds are frequently mixed and invested with other revenue sources in the government’s general fund, and, together, the money is used for other government purposes, including spending, repaying debts and cutting taxes. So, when the Social Security trust funds collect interest, they are merely accepting money from other parts of the government, according to Howard Gleckman, an analyst for the Tax Policy Center, a joint effort between the Brookings Institution and the Urban Institute. Without considering interest, Social Security has actually been running a deficit over recent years, Gleckman noted. And, when Social Security runs a deficit, the program draws on interest from the Social Security bonds, forcing government officials, already operating at a deficit, to borrow more money from other sources to make up the difference. "It’s an accounting fiction," Gleckman said of the interest payments. "It helps make the Social Security funds look more solvent, but really you've just taken (money) out of general fund. … The money is simply being transferred from one government account to the next." In 2010, the program ran a "cash deficit" of $49 billion, according to the Social Security Administration’s summary of its 2012 annual report. The following year, the deficit stood at about $45 billion, and, looking forward, the program’s future doesn’t look much brighter. Social Security trustees project the program’s cash deficit to exceed $60 billion over the next few years, and by 2033, the trust fund will no longer have enough money to cover full benefits for beneficiaries, according to the most recent estimates. "The Trustees project that (the deficit) will average about $66 billion between 2012 and 2018 before rising steeply as ... the number of beneficiaries continues to grow at a substantially faster rate than the number of covered workers," according to the annual report. Lawmakers from both parties have proposed ways to bridge the gap and salvage the program. But, with the insolvency date looming, Social Security stands to have an even greater effect on the debt moving forward, according to Laurence Kotnikoff, an economics professor at Boston University. "Nobody can claim Social Security isn’t part of the overall problem," Kotnikoff said. "It’s all labeling games. … It absolutely contributes to the overall fiscal situation. It’s in terrible shape." Our ruling: Social Security is designed as a self-supporting, pay-as-you-go program, in which current payroll taxes pay for current benefits. This played out for many years, and with interest, the program has built up an annual surplus, which appeared to help offset the national deficits. But, in reality, Social Security is not closed off from the rest of the government. The program’s surplus funds are frequently invested in Treasury bonds, and during surplus years, the bonds earn interest paid with other government dollars. And in recent years, the amount of taxes collected have not equaled the benefits distributed, leaving the Social Security funds facing a cash deficit, which then forces the government to borrow more money to offset. This was the case in 2010 and 2011, and Social Security trustees anticipate higher deficits looking forward. While there’s a case for both interpretations, we see clear evidence that Social Security does affect the nation’s debt and deficit. We rate Shaheen’s claim Mostly False.

pomt-04106	"[W]e see America's prison population exploding, with America having a greater percentage of its people behind bars than any other nation in the world!"	mostly true	/georgia/statements/2013/jan/14/hank-johnson/does-us-have-highest-percentage-people-prison/	A Georgia congressman recently penned a letter to an American legend that sparked some conversation among the PolitiFact Georgia staff. U.S. Rep. Hank Johnson, a Democrat who lives in DeKalb County, decried the large number of Americans incarcerated, among other things, in a message to Frederick Douglass, the famed 19th-century abolitionist, author and activist. The letter was written to commemorate the 150th anniversary of the Emancipation Proclamation, written by President Abraham Lincoln to end slavery. "[W]e see America's prison population exploding, with America having a greater percentage of its people behind bars than any other nation in the world!" wrote Johnson, a former magistrate court judge. PolitiFact Georgia examined a similar claim by Johnson before. The congressman claimed last year that the United States imprisons more than any nation in the world. PolitiFact Georgia found Johnson was likely correct that the U.S. has more people behind bars than any other country, but America does have one of the largest populations in the world, so it’s not entirely an apples-to-apples comparison. Our research showed there are probably some nations with a higher percentage of people in prison, so we rated Johnson’s claim Half True. We were slightly surprised by this claim floating around again. We wondered whether there was anything new to consider on this issue since we fact-checked it in May. This time, Johnson was talking about the percentage of people in jail, not the total prison population as he did last year. We decided to take a look. Last year, the estimates we found all said there were about 2.3 million people in U.S. prisons. That’s about 730 people in prison for every 100,000 Americans. The estimate remained about the same. The International Centre for Prison Studies, based at the University of Essex in Great Britain, keeps the most detailed information about prison populations worldwide. Its World Prison Population List is widely used in studies and by reporters. In the report we reviewed last year, the U.S. had the highest percentage of its citizens in prison among nations where the ICPS could verify such information. Russia and Rwanda ranked second and third, respectively. Both countries were well behind the United States. Russia had 598 people in its prisons per 100,000 citizens. As for China, the most recent ICPS report states that nation has at least 1.6 million people in its prisons. The number may be as much as 2.3 million if you include an estimated 650,000 held in detention centers. Using the larger estimate, that would be 170 people per 100,000 Chinese citizens, which is far lower than the U.S. At the time, we found it was possible that there were two other countries that put a greater percentage of people in prison: Cuba and North Korea. Has that changed? First, let’s look at Cuba. A 2003 study reported in The Miami Herald found an estimated 100,000 inmates in 200 prisons and labor camps spread across the Caribbean island. Several prominent human rights organizations did not dispute the figure. In 1995, the United Nations estimated there were "between 100,000 and 200,000 prisoners in all categories,'' the Herald reported. "If accurate, the figure of 100,000 inmates in an island of nearly 11.3 million people would give Cuba 888 inmates per 100,000 people, far ahead of the United States," the Herald article said. Johnson’s office sent us information that suggests the number of prisoners on the island may be much lower. The most recent ICPS report shows the prison population was 510 people per 100,000 residents as of May. In May 2011, Amnesty International compiled a report on North Korea and concluded there were an estimated 200,000 people being held in political prisoner camps. The estimate was based on satellite images and eyewitness accounts. That equates to 813 per 100,000, higher than the U.S. The ICPS has similar totals for North Korea, citing the South Korean National Human Rights Commission. North Korea’s total cannot be independently verified. "Otherwise, without any firm, recent, quantified statistics involving North Korean figures, it is very difficult to evaluate whether the statement that they have higher incarceration rates is accurate," said Andy Phelan, a spokesman for Johnson. "It is, however, entirely accurate to state that the United States has the highest reported incarceration rate, as well as the highest total prison population, based on the most recent studies." The United States has the highest percentage of people in its prisons of any nation that can be verified. From the most recent numbers we’ve seen, the U.S. may have a higher percentage than one nation (Cuba) we thought had more of its people in prison. We’ll give Johnson a higher grade this time on the Truth-O-Meter but still leave room for another country (North Korea, perhaps) that may have a higher percentage of its people in prison. Our rating: Mostly True.	None	Hank Johnson	None	None	None	2013-01-14T06:00:00	2013-01-01	['United_States']
pomt-01217	"In Rhode Island, a recent study showed that among a group of people who had been homeless for a year or more, Medicaid costs averaged about $60,000 per person."	false	/rhode-island/statements/2014/nov/23/anne-nolan/crossroads-head-anne-nolan-says-long-term-homeless/	The head of Rhode Island's largest homeless shelter argued in a Nov. 12, 2014 Providence Journal commentary that the costs of not finding someone a home can be very high. Anne Nolan, president of Crossroads Rhode Island, reported that, "In Rhode Island, a recent study showed that among a group of people who had been homeless for a year or more, Medicaid costs averaged about $60,000 per person, which is far higher than the typical $18,096 per person per year for disabled adults on Medicaid and $9,240 per person per year for the average Medicaid recipient." That's a huge difference. We were curious about whether those numbers were accurate and why the gap was so large. Medicaid is a joint state-federal, government health-care program for the very poor. Nolan’s commentary referenced the 2013 "Rhode Island Annual Medicaid Expenditure Report," developed by the state's office of Health and Human Services. We located the report, but we couldn't find any numbers that matched Nolan’s. So we emailed her to make sure that was really her source. She replied that the information actually came from a June 1, 2014, report by Providence College sociologist Eric Hirsch, in which he identified 5,986 Rhode Islanders who had spent at least one night in an emergency shelter over a 28-month period and discovered that 2,308 were covered by Medicaid. Their Medicaid expenses totaled $58 million. Hirsch doesn't calculate the cost per person, so we did. It's $10,795 per person per year. That's pretty close to the average for all Medicaid recipients and a far cry from $60,000. So where did Nolan get her $60,000 figure? In his report, Hirsch wanted to make the point that those costs were not evenly distributed among the homeless. "In fact," he wrote, "the 67 individuals who were homeless for one year or more and had the highest Medicaid bills had total charges of $9,325,375." That's $139,185 per person for these 67 people" over 28 months. "The corresponding annual charge was just under $60,000 per person," Hirsch wrote. But we immediately noticed a problem -- $60,000 isn't the average for all long-term homeless people. It's only for the 67 people who racked up the highest Medicaid bills, a distinction Nolan didn't make in her commentary. When we contacted Hirsch, he explained that, "We do want to be able to argue that it would be most cost effective to house the most vulnerable." In other words, finding housing for 'high cost' homeless are going to save the most money. He said he used an arbitrary cutoff -- expenses of $47,000 or more -- to identify the high-cost users. Because Nolan was talking about all long-term homeless on Medicaid -- not just the 67 with the highest bills -- we asked Hirsh for the information on the larger group. He went back to his data and reported to us that there were 442 long-term homeless people who had, on average, $23,650 in Medicaid charges per person per year. Although that's double the amount for the typical person who was homeless for at least one night, it's dramatically less than $60,000. When we wrote back to Nolan asking if she was aware that the $60,000 figure only applied to homeless Medicaid patients with the biggest bills, she said she had misinterpreted the report. Finally, for the record, Hirsch and Nolan erred when they said the average Medicaid cost is $18,096 per person per year for disabled adults. As Hirsch reported when we questioned the figure based on the state Medicaid report, the correct amount is $21,696. Our ruling Anne Nolan said Rhode Islanders who have been homeless for at least a year cost Medicaid an average of $60,000 per person per year. But the $60,000 cost she cites applied only to the 67 homeless people with the highest medical bills, a major caveat she didn't mention in her commentary. The annual dollar amount for all Medicaid recipients in the study who were homeless for at least a year was $23,650 -- a substantial cost to taxpayers, but far less than what Nolan indicated. Because Nolan's statement makes it sound like it applies to all long-term homeless people on Medicaid when, in fact, it only focuses on the most-expensive subset, we rate it False.

pomt-10289	The musical Mamma Mia! has "been selling out for years."	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/aug/15/john-mccain/mccain-knows-abba/	John McCain may not know much about culture, but he knows ABBA. At a town hall at the Aspen Institute on Aug. 14, 2008, McCain conceded that he didn't know a lot about art and music. New York Times reporter Katharine Seelye wrote that McCain said if he's "lacking in anything," it is an appreciation for music and art and "the other great things in life," partly because he spent 5 years as a prisoner of war. But then the 71-year-old senator launched into a defense of the Swedish pop band ABBA. "Everybody says, 'I hate ABBA, Oh, ABBA, how terrible, blah, blah, blah.' How come everybody goes to Mamma Mia! ?" McCain said. "Everybody goes! They've been selling out for years." We wondered if McCain was right that Mamma Mia!, the musical based on ABBA's recordings, has been "selling out for years." First, we will assume that McCain was referring to the stage version, which has been playing on Broadway since 2001, not the movie version, which opened this summer. The Broadway show's Web site says the stage production, which has been performed in eight languages, has been seen by more than 30-million people in over 170 cities. The Web site calls it "the ultimate feel-good show." And McCain seems to be keeping up with Broadway box office receipts. TicketNews, which tracks Broadway receipts, reports that Mamma Mia! is still selling out. For example, it sold out its performances the weeks ending Aug. 3 and Aug. 10, selling about 101 percent of its seats (the number exceeds 100 because it includes standing-room tickets). A survey of other weeks in the past year found the show nearly sold out or exceeded capacity. Alfred Branch Jr., news editor of TicketNews, told us that the show is "a virtual sellout most nights." So McCain is right that Mamma Mia has been selling out for years. This claim is True.	None	John McCain	None	None	None	2008-08-15T00:00:00	2008-08-14	['None']

pomt-02407	Under Scott Walker, Wisconsin "unemployment's up" from 4.8% to 6.2%	pants on fire!	/wisconsin/statements/2014/mar/07/mary-burke/democratic-challenger-mary-burke-says-wisconsin-un/	Even as it became clear that he's not on track to deliver 250,000 jobs by January 2015, Gov. Scott Walker has repeatedly told voters that Wisconsin’s unemployment rate has gone down since he took office in January 2011. News articles have chronicled a gradual decrease in the rate, including a report that it dipped to a five-year low in November 2013. And yet, with her first TV ad in the 2014 gubernatorial campaign, Democratic candidate Mary Burke contradicts that notion. Midway through the ad, unveiled March 5, 2014, the narrator says that "under Walker, unemployment’s up." Simultaneously, a figure on the screen changes from 4.8 percent to 6.2 percent. So, under Walker, has unemployment really gone up? And what are the numbers? What Burke says The ad starts by touting Burke. It cites Wisconsin jobs at Trek Bicycle Corp., the Burke family business, where Mary Burke worked as an executive years ago. And it states that Wisconsin had 72,000 more jobs when Burke served as state commerce secretary than it does today. (The 72,000 is an updated version of a claim Burke made in October 2013, which we rated Half True. She was correct on the number -- 84,000 at that time -- but overstated the credit she and Democratic Gov. Jim Doyle deserved.) Then the ad stops talking about Burke and transitions to Walker, citing anti-Burke ads from what it calls "Walker's" Republican Governors Association. Walker is a member of the national association's executive committee and was vice chairman in 2013. The narrator then says that "under Walker, unemployment’s up." That’s when the figure on the screen spins from 4.8 percent to 6.2 percent. The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, the federal government’s official jobs counter, is footnoted as the source. The narrator continues the attack on Walker by saying job prospects are down and layoffs continue. Regarding the unemployment rate claim specifically, Burke spokesman Joe Zepecki told us: "We're not examining it in terms of (Walker’s) time in office overall -- we're comparing it what it was when Burke was commerce secretary." But that's not what the viewer sees and hears when the ad pivots from praising Burke to attacking Walker. It talks only about Walker; it doesn’t compare him to Burke. Moreover, with the narrator’s words presented along with the two percentages on the screen, Burke’s message is that unemployment during Walker’s time as governor has risen from 4.8 percent to 6.2 percent. But unemployment was much higher than 4.8 percent when Walker took office. And the trend since then has been down, not up. Rates are down Asked for evidence to back the claim, Zepecki did not cite numbers from the start of Walker’s tenure. He told us that on an annual average, Wisconsin’s unemployment rate was never higher than 4.8 percent during the more 2 1/2 years that Burke was commerce secretary. In contrast, Zepecki said, the monthly rate under Walker has never been below 6.2 percent. We reviewed monthly figures from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the federal agency cited in the ad. -- When Burke served as state commerce secretary -- February 2005 to November 2007 -- Wisconsin's unemployment rate was steady. It started at 4.8 percent, hit a high of 4.9 percent in June 2007 and went as low as 4.6 percent, which was the rate when she left. -- After Burke left the commerce post, unemployment rose, and later dropped, during the rest of Doyle’s second term as governor. The rate peaked three times at 9.2 percent, including as late as January 2010, then eventually fell to 7.8 percent in December 2010, Doyle’s final full month in office. -- Under Walker, the highest unemployment rate has been 7.7 percent -- including in January 2011, the month he took office. Since then, the rate has gradually trended downward, with a bump up here and there, to a low of 6.3 percent in December 2013, the latest month available. (A footnote: The state Department of Workforce Development had reported the December 2013 rate one notch lower, at 6.2 percent. A spokesman for the state agency told us the federal Bureau of Labor Statistics revised the figure to 6.3 percent after the state agency announced its number.) So, without stating any comparison between Burke and Walker, the ad claims unemployment is higher under Walker and provides figures indicating an increase from 4.8 percent to 6.2 percent. But the rate was much higher than 4.8 percent when Walker took office and it has gone down, not up, during his tenure. Our rating Burke's said that "under Walker, unemployment’s up," from 4.8 percent to 6.2 percent. Burke defends the claim by saying 4.8 percent is a reference to when she served as state commerce secretary, which was several years before Walker became governor. But the ad gives no indication that that is the comparison she is making. Moreover, during Walker’s time as governor, unemployment started at 7.7 percent, not 4.8 percent. And rather than trending upward, the rate has steadily dropped to 6.3 percent. For a claim that is false and ridiculous, we give Burke a Pants on Fire.

pomt-08360	The lawyer who brought the case against NationsBank said "publicly that Alex Sink had nothing to do with the case, had nothing to do with the situation and didn't know about the problems."	mostly true	/florida/statements/2010/oct/26/alex-sink/alex-sink-says-lawyer-backs-claims-she-didnt-know-/	In their third and final gubernatorial debate on Oct. 25, 2010, Rick Scott and Alex Sink traded accusations that each has been party to fraud. Sink again hammered Scott for his time running Columbia/HCA and the hospital company's convictions and $1.7 billion in fines for defrauding Medicare and Medicaid. But this time Scott countered with allegations that Sink was the president of NationsBank operations in Florida when that company was accused of fraud and forced to pay government fines and settle a class-action lawsuit. Unlike Scott, Sink said she had what amounts to a get-out-of-jail-free card. "That case, the lawyer that brought that case -- it was a class-action case against another company -- he even has said publicly that Alex Sink had nothing to do with the case, had nothing to do with the situation and didn't know about the problems," Sink told CNN's John King and the St. Petersburg Times' Adam C. Smith, the debate's moderators. "What more can I say?" In a separate item, we dealt with Scott's accusations. You can read that item, here. In this fact check, we'll explore Sink's rebuttal. Some quick background about the case. In 1994, while Sink was president of NationsBank's Florida operations, a stock broker with bank subsidiary NationsSecurities came forward with what he described as an orchestrated nationwide scheme to get bank customers to move investments from safe, federally insured accounts to more risky brokerage and mutual funds. NationsSecurities broker David Cray, who worked in Florida, said the bank intentionally blurred the lines between its traditional banking business and its securities business and misled customers into thinking those securities investments were protected by the bank or the federal government. The scheme permeated the entire bank, Cray, and later others, said. Brokers were given sales scripts to try to convince bank customers to move their money into more risky securities. NationsSecurities branch managers encouraged employees to "use fear to sell" securities. In one orientation sales meeting, a manager suggested that a broker could ask customers: "Is this your risky money or safe money? If this is risky, I know a guy at Merrill or Dean Witter." And NationsBank helped NationsSecurities by providing brokers with lists of customers who had Certificates of Deposit about to mature. The bank and stock brokers pushed the mutual funds because they received more lucrative fees, Cray said. The allegations led to a class-action lawsuit from investors who lost money by unknowingly making the risky investments, which in the end lost money. The Department of Justice and Securities and Exchange Commission also began investigations. Eventually, NationsBank and NationsSecurities settled the investigations, agreeing to pay $8.1 million to investors in 2002, paying civil fines to the federal government of $6.75 million in 2000 and $6.4 million in 2002 and $4 million to the SEC in 1998. No criminal charges were ever filed. Sink says the lawyer who started the case, Jonathan Alpert of Tampa, has said Sink had nothing to do with the scheme. Here's what Alpert told the St. Petersburg Times and Miami Herald in October when previously asked about Sink's role in selling the risky investments. "Alex Sink could've done nothing about it. It was run out of Charlotte," said Alpert, referring to NationsBank's headquarters. "I know she knew what was going on -– that investments were being sold in the bank -- but that's it. And she was powerless to stop it, anyway. I had e-mails where the state presidents were being told what to do, that they had to help the securities people. They would dig into customers bank accounts to identify people who had enough money to buy securities. "Charlotte said: 'This is what's going to happen in your bank lobbies and this is the way it's going to be.' They didn't say you're going to do A, B, C and D, they would say the bank cooperates fully with NationsSecurities," Alpert said. "If Alex Sink were involved in it, it would be a wonderful story for the gubernatorial election. But she didn't know anything about it." Alpert, who said he voted for Sink, said she no doubt knew that riskier investments were being sold in the bank, but that she was likely not aware of the way brokers were manipulating customers to close the sales. And Sink has previously told the Times she "had no authority or control" over the securities sales. "There were very, very strict firewalls between any kind of securities and brokerage operations and operations of commercial banking," she said. Those "firewalls," Sink said, were the result of the Depression-era Glass-Steagall law that separated commercial and investment banking. (The act was repealed in 1999.) But that didn't prevent Sink from finding out what was going on in her bank, noted Yale University finance expert Jonathan Macey. "She's the state bank president," he said. "She has the authority and perhaps the responsibility to know what's going on in her lobby." The original whistle-blower in the case, former NationsSecurity broker Cray, said, "I would tend not to point the finger at Alex Sink for this." Which brings us back to her statement. At the CNN/St. Petersburg Times debate Sink said that the lawyer who brought the case against NationsBank said "publicly that Alex Sink had nothing to do with the case, had nothing to do with the situation and didn't know about the problems." We think Sink is mostly quoting the lawyer in the NationsBank case, Jonathan Alpert, accurately. Alpert said Sink wasn't involved in the deceptive selling of more risky involvements through NationsSecurities and didn't know anything about the deceptive practices being employed. The companies NationsBank and NationsSecurities were managed separately. But Sink did know securities were being sold in her banks, and was in a position to voice questions or concerns about the practice if she sensed anything was being handled inappropriately. That's enough of a connection in our minds to knock this claim down one notch, and rate it Mostly True.	None	Alex Sink	None	None	None	2010-10-26T16:14:08	2010-10-25	['Alex_Sink', 'NationsBank']

pomt-00371	"It is only under President Trump that we have become the largest producer of oil and gas resources."	false	/virginia/statements/2018/sep/11/corey-stewart/corey-stewart-wrongly-says-trump-made-us-top-oil-a/	Thanks to President Donald Trump, Corey Stewart says, the United States is leading the world in oil and gas production. Stewart, Virginia’s Republican nominee for the U.S. Senate, made that claim twice during a July 21 debate with Democrat incumbent Tim Kaine. Stewart — a Trump loyalist — was portraying Kaine as a constant opponent of the president programs, including energy policy. "Because of President Trump, the United States is - now get this - the largest combined supplier of oil and gas resources on the planet," Stewart said. Stewart repeated the claim three minutes later. "It is only because of President Trump that we have become the largest producer of gas and oil resources," he said. We investigated Stewart’s statements. The U.S. is the world’s largest combined producer of gas and oil. The question is whether that happened during Trump’s presidency, which began Jan. 20, 2017. The answer is no. Stewart’s campaign didn’t respond to three requests for proof of Stewart’s claim. So we turned to research from the U.S. Energy Information Administration, which compiles data of global energy production and consumption. Figures and charts in an EIA report this spring show that the U.S. overtook Russia as the world’s largest gas and oil producer in 2011 - when Barack Obama was president. The U.S. produced 43.92 quadrillion British thermal units of gas and oil a day that year (roughly equivalent to 22 million barrels), compared to Russia’s daily rate of 43.85 quadrillion Btu. Saudi Arabia was a distant third, producing 26.5 quadrillion Btu daily. Since then, the U.S. has steadily expanded its lead. In 2017 - the first year of Trump’s presidency - the U.S. produced 59.4 quadrillion Btu of oil and gas daily, compared to Russia’s rate of 46.4 quadrillion Btu a day. Saudi Arabia again ranked third, at 28.7 quadrillion Btu. The EIA and other energy experts attribute the growth in U.S. production to a surge in extracting oil and gas from shale by hydraulic fracturing, or fracking. The process involves using water pressure to fracture rocks and release their natural gas and oil. The U.S. is the world leader in shale gas production. Shale production has made the U.S. the "undisputed global oil and gas leader," Fatih Birol, executive director of the International Energy Agency, which advises 30 nations, told a U.S. Senate committee in January 2018. He said the U.S. should keep that that status for years to come. The U.S. overtook Russia in 2009 to become the world’s largest gas producer. It passed Saudi Arabia in 2013 to become the leading oil producer. Our ruling Stewart said, "It is only under President Trump that we have become the largest producer of oil and gas resources." His campaign didn’t respond to three requests for proof. EIA data shows that U.S. has been the world leader in gas production since 2009, oil production since 2013, and combined gas and oil production since 2011. All of this happened well before Trump came to White House. We rate Stewart’s statement False. Correction: An earlier version of this fact check mispelled the first name of Fatih Birol.

pomt-05249	Says the Affordable Care Act was a federal takeover of the student loan industry and ‘profits’ on the loans go to help pay for the health care law.	mostly false	/new-hampshire/statements/2012/jun/01/kelly-ayotte/kelly-ayotte-claims-student-loan-change-government/	College loans and universal health care might not seem to be related, but U.S. Sen. Kelly Ayotte, R-NH, says there is an unusual linkage. Ayotte tied the two issues together last month in a May 8, 2012, email that her office sent to the press titled, "We Can Prevent a Student Loan Rate Increase Without Raising Taxes." The message, meant to convey Ayotte’s stance on temporarily extending existing rates on new subsidized Stafford loans, raised some questions about where student loan interest is going, and whether government "profits" from those loans are used to help pay for the health care law. "Under the Affordable Care Act, which amounted to a federal takeover of the student loan industry, the government borrows money at 2.8 percent and then loans money to students at 6.8 percent. Government profits are then used to help pay for the health care law," Ayotte asserted. PolitiFact Ohio has already laid out how the federal government is using student loans to pay for some health care reforms when it fact-checked a claim made by Sen. Rob Portman. Through the Reconciliation Act of 2012, which combined student loans and health care in one bill, Congress removed the private sector from the student loan process, to eliminate federal payments to banks and to move the revenue from the lending process into federal coffers. The savings was expected to be about $58 billion over 10 years, according to the Congressional Budget Office, with $39 billion going back into student loan programs, $10 billion toward deficit reduction and $9 billion directed toward health care. Yet, Ayotte’s email took Portman’s logic a step further, claiming a government takeover of the student loan industry and using profits to pay for Obamacare. PolitiFact has given plenty of Pants on Fire ratings to claims that say Obama’s health care law is a federal takeover of the health care system -- it was PolitiFact's Lie of the Year for 2010. But a takeover of the student loan industry? That’s a new one. First we contacted Ayotte’s legislative office to get sources for the claim. They cited PolitiFact Ohio’s Half True ruling on Portman’s claim as back up for Ayotte’s statement. But that only dealt with a portion of what Ayotte was saying. PolitiFact Ohio walked through the history of government involvement with student loans, up to the Reconciliation Act of 2010, which permanently moved the government away from subsidizing private lenders for student loans as had been the practice since 1965. With the Federal Family Education Loan (FFEL) program, created with the Higher Education Act of 1965, the federal government guaranteed student loans against default by promising a certain interest rate to the banks, even if the rates students paid were lower. In other words, the government money has always been behind the loans to American students. "(The Reconciliation Act of 2010) didn’t take over the student loan industry, it ended a federal program," said Jason Delisle, Director of the Federal Education Budget Project at the New America Foundation. "The semantic problem of the government taking over its own program is really kind of crazy." "You wouldn’t talk about the government taking over the Social Security program, or a government takeover of Medicare," Delisle said. "It didn’t take over the industry. The private companies that were involved were participating in a federal program and were getting paid for that. So how do you get ‘federal takeover’ out of that?" Through the FFEL program, the government paid additional fees to banks for administration and collection of student loans, providing them a revenue stream. While millions of Americans earned college degrees, the system required billions of dollars in federal subsidies, and some in Washington, especially Democrats, sought alternatives, which ultimately prompted The Reconciliation Act of 2010. When we asked Ayotte’s office to address the "federal takeover" of student loans, they pointed to the CBO break down of the Reconciliation Act that explains the reconciliation package would eliminate the federal guaranteed loan program and replace it with direct loans administered by the Department of Education and funded through the U.S. Treasury. Because the government has always backstopped student loans, calling the Reconciliation Act of 2010 a "federal takeover" isn’t accurate, said Justine Sessions, a spokeswoman for the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Pensions and Labor, which is chaired by Democrat Tom Harkin. "What the health care reconciliation package did was eliminate the middleman," Sessions said. "The middleman equals a bunch of private banks." In addition, many of the same companies involved in the guaranteed loan program service the expanded direct loan program, Delisle added. They include nonprofit and for-profit companies, including Sallie Mae, Nel Net, Mohela, Granite State Management and Resources, among others. "The federal government can’t do all this work itself," Delisle said. "(The guaranteed loan program) wasn’t really a private sector thing. What’s really important to understand about that is the government set all of the terms on the loans, the interest rates, the terms of repayment, all of that was set in law and the loan companies couldn’t change those." And private lenders can still make loans to students, Delisle added. "They can do it, they just don’t get any subsidies from the government," Delisle said. "They don’t do it because it’s a money loser." As for the rates Ayotte’s staff provided, those were accurate, Delisle said, but to call the interest the government gains on the loans "profits," is a stretch. "Banks can borrow at the same rate as the federal government," Delisle said. "They don’t make money off lending to students at 6.8 percent. … This concept that the difference between the rate the government charges on the loan and the rate they pay to borrow is profit, is totally wrong." Subsidized loans do not make money for the government, Sessions said. They actually cost the federal government money. "The claim seems to conflate two completely unrelated issues," Sessions said. "The 6.8 percent interest rate was set by Congress in 2002 with overwhelming bipartisan support and it was the projected average rate that would result in 2006 under a fixed rate formula." Loans had the same interest rates under both the direct loan and FFEL programs, Sessions said, and the cost of student loans to the government fluctuates with program changes, economic conditions, borrower repayment patterns, and the relationship between the government’s borrowing rate and the interest rate at which borrowers repay loans. There’s also more to the cost of the loan than what the government pays to borrow, Delisle added, including losses from defaults, administrative costs, cost of equity, loan forgiveness, and risk. Current fixed rates do not offset those additional costs. "The bottom line is that the claim about the 2010 legislation that cut out the middleman in the student loan system is completely unrelated to the claim about what government charges for student loans," Sessions said. "Reinstating the FFEL program would cost the government additional fees and subsidies that would be paid to banks." Our ruling The government’s Reconciliation Act of 2010 was not a takeover, but rather an elimination of a federal student loan program the government had used since 1965. Private companies are still involved in servicing the program and private lenders can still make their own student loans without a government subsidy. The government does borrow in the 2.8 percent ballpark and loans money to students at 6.8 percent but the difference is not a profit, it helps compensate for the unanticipated losses inherent with any loan.

pomt-08655	On whether President Obama's speeches to school children spread "socialist ideology."	full flop	/florida/statements/2010/sep/14/jim-greer/former-florida-gop-chair-apologizes-obama-educatio/	A year ago, we fact-checked a statement from the Republican Party of Florida that claimed President Barack Obama intended to indoctrinate school children with socialist ideology. The alleged vehicle: a back-to-school speech given to the nation's students. Some of Obama's other political opponents echoed the charge, and principals across the country had to answer questions from parents about whether students were required to watch the speech. This year, Obama gave a speech to schoolchildren on Sept. 14, 2010, with little controversy. Like last year, he spoke of the necessity of hard work and a good education. But we were surprised by a dramatic change of position for Jim Greer, the former head of the Republican Party of Florida. Here's his statement from last year: "As the father of four children, I am absolutely appalled that taxpayer dollars are being used to spread President Obama's socialist ideology. The idea that school children across our nation will be forced to watch the president justify his plans for government-run health care, banks and automobile companies, increasing taxes on those who create jobs, and racking up more debt than any other president, is not only infuriating, but goes against beliefs of the majority of Americans, while bypassing American parents through an invasive abuse of power." We fact-checked that at the time and rated it Pants on Fire. We found no evidence that Obama intended to address school children on public policy matters, much less socialism. All evidence pointed to a more generic speech on the importance of education, and that's what Obama delivered. Greer's position has entirely changed since then, and in more ways than one. Greer lost his party chairmanship in January 2010, and state authorities arrested him in June on corruption charges, alleging that he used a secret contract to send party donations to a consulting firm he owned. Greer now faces six felony charges, including fraud and money laundering. (PolitiFact Florida has detailed a timeline on Greer's departure from the state party.) Meanwhile, Gov. Charlie Crist -- who picked Greer as party chairman after Crist became governor in 2006 -- left the Republican Party in April to run as an independent for U.S. Senate. The party supports Marco Rubio, a former state legislator and speaker of the House, in that race. This year, to mark Obama's speech to students, Greer sent the following text message to Florida reporters: "In the year since I issued a prepared statement regarding President Obama speaking to the nation’s school children, I have learned a great deal about the party I so deeply loved and served. Unfortunately, I found that many within the GOP have racist views and I apologize to the president for my opposition to his speech last year and my efforts to placate the extremists who dominate our party today. My children and I look forward to the president's speech." We called the Republican Party of Florida and asked them about Greer's statement, but they declined to comment. That could be because Greer earlier this year filed a lawsuit against the party for failing to pay him severance of $124,000, plus health care. Just this past weekend, party officials said they were contemplating their own lawsuit against Greer and Crist for misspending party funds. So Greer is no longer head of the party and repudiates his own statements from a year ago. Could Greer's new view on Obama's school speech be just another stick-in-the-eye to the people who kicked him out of his job? Sure. Greer sent a letter to Crist last month asking for his campaign contributions back, because Greer said he needs the money to defend himself. In the letter, he blasted state party leaders, some by name, saying they "are simply liars, racists, and extremists ... the current bunch that are running the show will stop at nothing to cover for their own misdeeds." Whatever Greer's motivations, we very seldom see such a thorough change of position on over-the-top political rhetoric, much less an apology. To note that dramatic reversal, we put Greer on the Flip-O-Meter and rate his statement a Full Flop.	None	Jim Greer	None	None	None	2010-09-14T17:36:11	2010-09-14	['Barack_Obama']

pomt-12584	"There is no legal basis" for Donald Trump's "missile strike against Syrian military assets."	false	/wisconsin/statements/2017/apr/07/mark-pocan/mark-pocan-wrongly-claims-donald-trump-had-no-lega/	The morning after the U.S. cruise missiles assault on a Syrian air base, U.S. Rep. Mark Pocan questioned the legal authority of President Donald Trump to order the attack. "There is no legal basis for last night’s missile strike against Syrian military assets," the Madison-area Democrat declared in a statement on April 7, 2017. "Congress must be called back immediately, if President Trump plans to escalate our military involvement. He must send a new Authorization for Use of Military Force (AUMF) to Congress, as I have previously called for." The 59-missile assault was launched in retaliation for a chemical weapons attack by the government against Syrian civilians two days earlier. News reports quoted U.S. officials as saying Trump had the right to use force to defend national interests and to protect civilians from atrocities. Meanwhile, first-term U.S. Rep. Mike Gallagher, R-Green Bay, while praising the "limited strikes," also said Trump "should seek congressional authorization for any sustained military operation in Syria." There’s certainly debate over the extent of a president’s authority to use military force without approval from Congress. But Pocan went too far in saying there is no legal basis for Trump’s action. Competing arguments To support Pocan’s claim, his office noted the U.S. Constitution assigns to Congress the power to declare war, and sent us commentary on that provision and the missile attack by the American Civil Liberties Union. The ACLU reiterated its position that "the decision to use military force requires Congress’ specific, advance authorization." Pocan also cited the War Powers Resolution of 1973, which was enacted over a veto by Republican President Richard Nixon. It says "the introduction of United States Armed Forces into hostilities" can be done only "pursuant to a declaration of war, specific statutory authorization, or a national emergency created by attack upon the United States, its territories or possessions, or its armed forces." And Harvard law professor Jack Goldsmith, an assistant attorney general under Republican President George W. Bush, argued in 2013 that Democratic President Barack Obama didn’t have unilateral authority to launch attacks against Syria, as was being considered at the time. Goldsmith said the president’s authority to use force without congressional approval had been extended to protect American persons and property abroad, but that rationale would not have applied to the attacks Obama contemplated (but never carried out). The Trump administration, meanwhile, also invokes the Constitution (Article 2) in asserting that the president has the power to defend the U.S. national interest. In this case, that interest is described as "promoting regional stability, which the use of chemical weapons threatens" -- which the Trump administration likened to the Obama administration’s justification for using force in Libya in 2011. Other views Experts agree that in limited instances, such as the Syrian missile attack, a president has legal authority provided in the Constitution as commander-in chief. Cameron University history and government professor Lance Janda said he agrees with Pocan’s call for a new congressional authorization for use of force, adding: "We have not declared war on anyone since 1941, and yet we are the most active nation state on the planet when it comes to military action." But "having said that," Janda continued, the Constitution gives the president authority as commander in chief to use force to protect our national interests and War Powers Resolution gives the president "leeway to respond to attacks or other emergencies." McGill University professor of international relations Mark Brawley also said the president has authority to use military force in a crisis, but then should notify Congress within 48 hours. The president also should ask Congress for authority to use military force if there will be extended conflict, or for a declaration of war, if the United States will be at war with Syria, he said. Like the Trump administration, Georgetown University professor Anthony Arend, whose specialties include international relations and constitutional law of U.S. foreign relations, also cited Article 2 of the Constitution and the president’s power as commander-in-chief. He told us: "While the precise scope of this power is unclear, a strong argument can be made that the president can use force in short military operations -- especially where there is minimal risk to American lives -- without congressional authorization. Indeed, over the years, Congress has generally acquiesced in such presidential uses of force. "Because the air strikes were undertaken by cruise missiles that put virtually no American lives at risk and because the strikes lasted only minutes, the president's action would seem to be a lawful use of force under the Constitution. Needless to say, if further military actions were to be undertaken, they could rise to the level of requiring congressional authorization." Added Richard Stoll, an international conflict scholar at Rice University, about the Trump attack: "This is not new." Stoll said he would advise a president to get congressional approval before taking additional action, but presidents many times have taken a "one-off" action such as the Syrian attack. Those views correspond to a 2013 fact check of then-U.S. Sen. Joe Lieberman, who said Obama would have had the legal authority to strike Syria without a vote from Congress. PolitiFact National’s rating was True. As our colleagues reported: Since the last time Congress declared war, at the beginning of World War II, presidents have generally initiated military activities using their constitutionally granted powers as commander in chief without having an official declaration of war in support of their actions. Even under the War Powers Resolution, the president can send in forces without approval from Congress. Lower courts have ruled in favor of the White House in the use of force, and the U.S. Supreme Court declined to hear an appeal on that point. Our rating Pocan said: "There is no legal basis" for Trump's "missile strike against Syrian military assets." For limited military activities like the missile strike, presidents can send in forces without approval from Congress. We rate Pocan’s statement False.

pomt-15008	"Millions of dollars are spent by Planned Parenthood to elect Democrats to the House of Representatives and the Senate."	mostly true	/wisconsin/statements/2015/oct/08/sean-duffy/planned-parenthood-spends-millions-elect-democrats/	During debate on a bill to defund Planned Parenthood, U.S. Rep. Sean Duffy, R-Wis., alluded to secretly recorded videos that prompted the legislation, then he made a claim about the group’s political activity. "If you watch this debate, you have to ask: How could anybody defend the practices at Planned Parenthood?" Duffy said on the House floor on Sept. 18, 2015, the day the House approved the one-year defunding. "Harvesting body parts. How could anybody defend that? It’s an easy answer. Look in (the) political season. Millions of dollars, millions of dollars are spent by Planned Parenthood to elect Democrats to the House of Representatives and to the Senate. This isn’t about babies; this is about money." A reader asked us to check Duffy’s claim. The videos, the funding The videos, first released in July 2015, show Planned Parenthood officials offhandedly discussing how they sometimes procure tissue from aborted fetuses for medical research. The anti-abortion Center for Medical Progress, which recorded the videos, alleges Planned Parenthood is illegally profiting from fetal organ sales. But Planned Parenthood says it has done nothing illegal, and that the videos were edited in a misleading way. The defunding bill, which has yet to be taken up by the U.S. Senate, would end federal payments to Planned Parenthood for a year, diverting the money to thousands of community health centers. Republicans say those clinics could handle the displaced Planned Parenthood patients, but Democrats say the centers are overburdened and sometimes in remote locations. Planned Parenthood gets around $450 million each year in federal payments, mostly Medicaid reimbursements for handling low-income patients. That's around one-third of the organization's $1.3 billion annual budget. As for Planned Parenthood’s political activity, some of this ground was covered when Republican presidential candidate Carly Fiorina made a similar claim. She said Planned Parenthood "funnels millions of dollars in political contributions to pro-abortion candidates." PolitiFact National rated the statement Mostly True. Millions have been spent. But the caveat is that the operational, medical clinics of Planned Parenthood cannot spend money in politics -- separate entities that are affiliated with Planned Parenthood can. Duffy’s claim Duffy’s claim was a little different -- that Planned Parenthood spent millions to elect Democrats to the House and Senate. We found, using figures from the nonpartisan Center for Responsive Politics, that that was this case. In the 2014 election cycle alone, Planned Parenthood-affiliated groups that can't give directly to candidates or coordinate with them, such as Planned Parenthood Votes, a Super PAC, made over $6 million in independent expenditures. That included $1.85 million spent in support of Democrats and $2.87 million spent against Republicans. "In addition, Planned Parenthood's PAC gave nearly $590,000 to congressional candidates, all of them Democrats." The numbers would be higher, of course, if previous cycles were included. Our rating Duffy said: "Millions of dollars are spent by Planned Parenthood to elect Democrats to the House of Representatives and the Senate." By law, the operational, medical clinics of Planned Parenthood cannot spend money in politics. But separate entities that are affiliated with Planned Parenthood can, and they spent millions just in the 2014 election cycle to elect Democrats. We rate Duffy’s statement Mostly True.

Today, there are less than 30,000."	mostly true	/punditfact/statements/2015/aug/03/jack-hanna/jack-hanna-talks-cecil-week-claims-africas-lion-po/	As experts debate legal consequences for the Minnesota dentist who killed well-known Zimbabwean lion Cecil, conservationists and animal rights activists are using the opportunity to highlight threats to the long-term viability of lions in the wild. Animal expert and television personality Jack Hanna, who is also the director emeritus of the Columbus Zoo and Aquarium, emphasized how quickly the lion population has decreased within his lifetime on ABC's This Week. "In 1947, when I was born, there were about 450,000 lions," Hanna said in the Aug. 2 interview. "In the mid-'70s, when my kids were born, there were about 100,000. Today, there are less than 30,000." We wondered if Hanna’s claim about the lion population was true. Has the population really shrunk by more than 90 percent in 68 years, and if so, why? When it comes to counting lions, accurate numbers are almost as elusive as the animals themselves. 1940s Most scientists and researchers agree that the number of lions in the wild is in decline. The Switzerland-based International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) lists the species as "vulnerable" on its threat scale, just one level below "endangered." It’s the speed of the decline that is in dispute. A spokesperson for Hanna said he was citing loose figures from the National Geographic Society’s Big Cats Initiative. The organization’s page on lions estimates that there were around 450,000 African lions in the 1940s, 100,000 in the 1980s, and 20,000 today — almost exactly mirroring what Hanna said. Other research questions some of Hanna's figures. He claimed more than 450,000 lions roamed the savannahs in the 1940s, but detailed studies of the population weren’t conducted back then. That means data for that period is virtually nonexistent. Susie Weller, a spokeswoman for Panthera, another big cats advocacy group, cited her organization’s own estimate that there were already as few as 200,000 "over a century ago." In other words, no one really knows how many lions there were in the 1940s. "You might even see numbers in the millions," said Stuart Pimm, a professor of conservation ecology at Duke University and a contributor to the Big Cats Initiative. 1970s Hanna then claimed there were 100,000 lions in the wild during the 1970s. No empirical data exists for that time either, not that scientists haven't tried to make a best guess. In 1996, a team of researchers employed land-use data to predict there were around 75,800 lions in 1980. The study, which was not published, is widely cited and was conducted at Cranfield University’s International Eco Technology Research Centre in the United Kingdom. Pimm said that this strategy was one of the more reliable ways to estimate the size of the population. "What we can consider," he said, "is how much lion habitat there was back then, and then approximate how many lions fit into that area. But if you’re going to put a number on it, you have to be careful to couch it in very, very approximate terms." The geographic analysis is the closest anyone has come to a population count for that time, and it’s a rough guess at best. Jason Riggio, a doctoral candidate at the University of California, Davis and the author of a study on lion populations, said the 1980 number "arguably should not be cited as fact" because it doesn’t take into account expert opinions or survey data. Hanna’s claim that there were 100,000 lions left in the 1970s isn’t far off from the closest estimate for that decade, yet isn’t based on any convincing data. Today Hanna was more on target when he said there "are less than 30,000" lions left in the wild today. A widely used figure for the present population comes from the 2012 study led by Riggio. The paper, which combines data from two counts in the early 2000s, puts the population "between 32,000 and 35,000." Other organizations cited the IUCN's Red List of Threatened Species as an authoritative source for species population numbers and trends. The Red List questions Riggio’s numbers, arguing that, among other issues, his team’s use of older figures ignored downward trends that may have taken place in some regions. "We have greater confidence in the estimate of fewer than 20,000 lions in Africa than in a number over 30,000," reads the group’s file on lions. Still, Hanna’s claim that there are fewer than 30,000 lions left in the wild today is within the range of these two estimates. Lions, Pimm said said, stake out in some of the most unforgiving natural habitats in the world, making them hard to locate, spot and count. "There are roughly 30,000 lions in Africa," said Pimm, "and they’re spread out over a massive area. People just don’t realize how big the continent really is." Some researchers in the field, including Riggio, are reluctant to mention specific numbers for the changing lion population given the problematic data. But the experts agreed that Hanna's general point about a massive decline in the species is accurate. The threat lions pose to farms means that "they are persecuted intensely in livestock areas across Africa," according to the IUCN, and growth in the bushmeat market has led to a decrease in the abundance of their prey. While hunters claim that trophy hunting in small numbers is a valuable way to finance conservation, the IUCN has reported an unsustainable number of kills in regions across the continent. Our ruling Hanna said, "In 1947, when I was born, there were about 450,000 lions. In the mid-'70s, when my kids were born, there were about 100,000. Today, there are less than 30,000." Counting lions in the wild is extremely difficult and requires a lot of estimation. Any hard numbers, therefore, should be taken with a grain of salt. Hanna’s claim reflects the consensus among researchers that lion numbers are in decline. The exact figures are up for some deabte, but his point is certainly valid. We rate it Mostly True.

pomt-01074	"Over half the people on disability are either anxious or their back hurts."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/jan/16/rand-paul/rand-paul-says-most-people-receive-disability-back/	Turning 40? Sen. Rand Paul says you can look forward to back pain in your near future, and maybe some anxiety. But don’t try to turn your ailments into a government check. At a breakfast event Wednesday, Jan. 14 in New Hampshire, the Kentucky Republican and potential presidential candidate spoke out against a public safety net that catches too many people who don’t need help. "The thing is, all of these programs, there’s always somebody who’s deserving. (But) everybody in this room knows somebody who is gaming the system," Paul said. The proof? Look no further than the diagnoses landing people on disability, he added. "Over half the people on disability are either anxious or their back hurts. Join the club," he said to laughter. "Who doesn’t get up a little anxious for work every day and their back hurts? Everybody over 40 has a little back pain." Paul may be having a little fun about the aches and pains of growing older, but his comment raises serious questions about a program relied on by millions of people. Is the majority of the disability population suffering from back pain and anxiety? We decided to check the numbers. Identifying the problem The Social Security Administration has provided benefits to people with disabilities since President Dwight Eisenhower signed legislation in 1956. The program is intended to provide cash assistance to people who are disabled for a year or longer and cannot work or can only work menial jobs for little pay (about $1,000 a month). The number of individuals receiving disability has been on an upward trajectory for decades. In 1970, there were less than 2 million beneficiaries; now, the program has surpassed 10 million, far outpacing U.S. population growth. Nearly two-thirds of people on disability are 50 or older. The large growth in the program has sparked claims of waste, fraud and abuse. And indeed, several reports from the Government Accountability Office have found problems with the program, as Paul’s office pointed out. After an audit of disability insurance in 2013, the Government Accountability Office estimated that in fiscal year 2011, the Social Security Administration made $1.29 billion in potential cash benefit overpayments to about 36,000 individuals who were working and making more than $1,100 a month (the limit to receive disability benefits). The 36,000 people receiving improper payments, while a lot on paper, represent about 0.4 percent of all beneficiaries, the report said. There are other ways Social Security gives out benefits to those not deserving, but paying people already working is about 72 percent of the problem, according to the Social Security Administration. Factoring that in, the GAO estimates overpayments equaled $1.62 billion, or 1.27 percent of all disability benefits, in 2011. It’s a lot of money, but the disability program is a $128 billion program. The Government Accountability Office goes on to say the exact number of improper payments is unknown. It could be higher. Additionally, another GAO report warned the Social Security Administration’s efforts to thwart potential physician-assisted fraud are "hampered by a lack of planning, data, and coordination." Back and anxiety Let’s narrow in on Paul’s specific claim: "Over half the people on disability are either anxious or their back hurts." This is not rooted in the official numbers. Social Security does not group people by back pain or anxiety in any of their published reports. Instead, they track a much broader list of physical and mental ailments. What would back pain or anxiety fall under? Most back problems would fall under the category "diseases of the musculoskeletal system and connective tissue," the most common ailment. In 2013, 27.7 percent of all people received benefits for these types of ailments. If you look at just workers, it was 30.5 percent. There's also another category, "injuries," that might include some back problems. Those affect another 4 percent of workers. But not all musculoskeletal system and connective tissue diseases are back problems. Far from it. They include ailments ranging from a broken bone and bad burns to amputated limbs and deformities. Anxiety would be included in "mental disorders." That category is broken down further as follows: Mental disorder Percent of all workers on disability Autistic disorder 0.2 Developmental disorders 0.1 Childhood and adolescent disorders not otherwise clasified 0.1 Intellectual disability 4.1 Mood disorders 14.9 Organic mental disorders 3.4 Schizophrenic and other psychotic 4.8 Other 3.9 Total 31.5 As you can see, it's a pretty confusing list, and it's not immediately clear which category certain mental ailments would fall into. If by "anxious," Paul meant a catchall term for all mental disorders, then, sure, about one-third of all disabled workers have some sort of mental issue. Paul's spokesman singled out the subcategory "mood disorders" when explaining how Paul reached his conclusion. Other media outlets have similarly placed anxiety under this heading. However, the Social Security Administration told us that category typically includes affective disorders like depression, not anxiety disorders. Instead, people suffering from "anxiety disorders" -- which include things like post-traumatic stress disorder and obsessive-compulsive disorder -- are included in the "other" category. That category also includes diseases like Tourette syndrome and affects far fewer people than mood disorders, about 3.9 percent. For the sake of argument, let's follow Paul's faulty logic. Even assuming generously that every single person with a musculoskeletal system problem came in with "back pain," and every person with a "mood disorder" had anxiety, it still only equals 45.4 percent, less than half. Throw in "other" mental disorders, you're still just below 50 percent. If you categorize anxiety correctly as "other" and add it to all musculoskeletal system problems, you would end up far lower, at 34 percent. And again, not every person with a musculoskeletal problem has a back problem, and not every person with a mental disorder has anxiety. For Paul to imply as much is either stretching reality or downplaying serious ailments. There has been an increase in the number of people receiving disability for musculoskeletal system and mental problems. In 1961, the most common ailment for new beneficiaries was heart disease or stroke. Meanwhile, 8 percent of those going on disability received assistance for musculoskeletal system issues. That’s an interesting and notable statistic, and one worth exploring. NPR published a very extensive report suggesting some older, unskilled workers are going on disability (many with back issues) because the only jobs available to them are physically strenuous. But that doesn’t wash away Paul’s mischaracterization of the ailments nor his inflation of the numbers. Our ruling Paul said, "Over half the people on disability are either anxious or their back hurts." The numbers don’t add up. The two broader disability categories that include back pain ("diseases of the musculoskeletal system") and anxiety disorders ("mental disorders - other") don’t even equal close to 50 percent, let alone those two ailments by themselves. Paul’s quip might make for a good soundbite, but it’s not rooted in reality. We rate the statement False.	None	Rand Paul	None	None	None	2015-01-16T16:23:11	2015-01-14	['None']
pomt-15179	Says "56 percent of (the U.S.-Mexico) border is not under our control."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/aug/23/ben-carson/ben-carson-most-border-not-under-our-control/	Republican presidential candidate Ben Carson suggested drones could really help the country’s overstressed border patrol. Carson told CNN’s Jim Acosta on State of the Union on Aug. 23, 2015, that the drones could be used for more than just surveillance along the Mexican border, potentially taking out caves that smugglers and cartels use to cross into the United States. "We're not getting support from the federal government to deal with these people," he said. "They're being outgunned. Fifty-six percent of that border is not under our control." There was a bit of overlap between Acosta and Carson (this transcript quotes Carson saying 66 percent), but we heard 56 percent. We wondered if Carson was correct that more than half of our southern border was "not under our control." We didn’t hear back from Carson’s campaign when we tried to contact them for the source of the retired neurosurgeon’s figure. But we have an idea where he may have gotten it. A 2011 Government Accountability Office report said U.S. Customs and Border Protection considered 873 miles of the almost 2,000-mile U.S. border with Mexico under "operational control" in fiscal year 2010. Those are areas they classified "as those in which it has the ability to detect, respond, and interdict illegal activity at the border or after entry into the United States." Operational control was broken down into two definitions: "Controlled" areas had enough agents to either deter or detect and apprehend illegal entries immediately at the border. We must note this still doesn’t mean a 100 percent apprehension rate, but controlled status accounted for 129 miles, or about 15 percent of those 873 miles under operational control. The other 85 percent were considered "managed" areas, where agents could still identify and apprehend most entries from as far as 100 miles away. The other 1,120 miles of border — the 56 percent of the total border to which Carson is likely referring — fell under two other definitions. The report said nearly two-thirds was considered "monitored," meaning illegal entries were likely to be detected, but resources or accessibility could make responses difficult. The other third was labeled "low-level monitored," defined as regions where detection and interdiction were constrained by few resources or poor infrastructure. "Border Patrol reported that these two levels of control were not acceptable for border security," the GAO report said. So does that mean they aren’t under control, as Carson said? Experts have told us before that there’s no set definition for a secure border, and it’s not fair to set the standard as a 100 percent border-crosser apprehension rate because then no part of the border would qualify. Border Patrol agents are charged with many duties beyond stopping illegal immigration. They are supposed to catch drug smugglers, weapons traffickers, potential terrorists, money launderers and more. Apprehensions only tell part of the story. Because no one knows how many crossing attempts there truly are each year, by any group targeted by the border patrol, there’s no way to really set a universal metric for security. The 2011 GAO report said the Department of Homeland Security was replacing its border security measures, and it expected data reported to Congress to wane as programs were updated through 2012. A January 2015 report by now retired Sen. Tom Coburn, R-Okla., said that as of 2014, more than 700 miles of the southern border "were not secure." The report blamed "little to no deployment density or aviation surveillance coverage." The oversight report blamed the problems in part to a lack of overall border security plan by the Department of Homeland Security. But Coburn’s report also said that "it is impossible to judge whether the border is secure" based on available data. There’s no way to tell just how many crossings went undetected, the report said, and changes in apprehensions and economic and social factors in immigration made extrapolating overall security very difficult. As far as reported statistics, we know that illegal migration through the border has decreased in recent years. The Bipartisan Policy Center said that in 2007, there were 1.6 million instances of people apprehended, turned back at the border or evidence of people making it across, known as "gotaways." The center said that number had dropped to 741,881 in 2013. There also is evidence the number of native Mexicans living in the U.S. is leveling, experts have said, and eight of the nine sectors the border is broken into by the Border Patrol had higher effectiveness ratings in 2013 than they did in 2006. Christopher Wilson, deputy director of the Mexico Institute at the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars, gives Carson credit for using the term "control," since that’s the word the border patrol used in part to measure its own effectiveness. But as a practical matter, it’s impossible to stop everyone from crossing the border, he said. That makes it difficult to settle on how much enforcement would be required for everyone to consider it "enough." Wilson added things have indeed improved, no matter which source you cite. "All the different measures point to an overall improvement in border security over at least the last 10 years," Wilson said. "We don’t know what a secure border is, because we’ve never defined it as a society." Our ruling Carson said that "56 percent of that (U.S.-Mexico) border is not under our control." U.S. Customs and Border Protection said in a 2011 report that 873 miles of the U.S. Mexico border was under "operational control." The other 1,120 miles, or about 56 percent, fell under two classifications "not acceptable for border security." That doesn’t mean there is an utter lack of control, but that the agency’s ability to detect or respond (or both) to crossings was hampered by a lack of resources or infrastructure. Carson did not specify what he meant by control, and experts have told us security is a subjective metric. It doesn’t appear he pulled the number out of thin air, but available data does show that illegal crossings along the border have overall been on the decline. We rate Carson’s statement Half True.

pomt-00737	"We have an 80 percent graduation rate in high school after spending more per student than any country in the world other than Liechtenstein, I think, or Luxembourg and a couple other small countries."	true	/florida/statements/2015/apr/21/jeb-bush/does-united-states-spend-more-student-most-countri/	While some conservative activists and presidential hopefuls have trashed Common Core, former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush remains a supporter of the education standards. Bush’s support for Common Core could put him at odds with primary challengers should he decide to enter the race: Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Florida, opposes Common Core, while Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker, a potential candidate, once showed tacit support but later called for repeal. During an event on April 17 in New Hampshire, a Nashua resident asked Bush straight up: "Gov. Bush: where do you stand on Common Core?" Bush said: "Thank you for bringing that up. If it wasn’t going to be brought up, I was going to bring it up myself." Bush then made his case that Common Core is essentially a push for higher standards, to address concerns about student achievement in the United States. "We have an 80 percent graduation rate in high school after spending more per student than any country in the world other than Liechtenstein I think, or Luxembourg and a couple other small countries," Bush said. Bush drew applause when he said "we don’t need a federal government involved in this at all," and added that he supported proposed legislation to ban the feds from creating standards or curriculum. (PolitiFact has rated multiple claims from other politicians that Common Core is a "federal takeover" of education and found them misleading.) Here we will fact-check Bush’s claim about the national graduation rate and how much we spend per student compared to other countries. Graduation rates and per-pupil spending There are a few different ways to measure graduation rates including the federal government's cohort method, which examines how many students who enter 9th grade graduate four years later with a standard diploma. By that measurement, the national average was about 81 percent in 2012-13. (Florida is below that national average.) As for spending, Bush’s spokeswoman pointed to a 2013 Associated Press article about a study by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development that compared per-pupil spending among 34 advanced industrialized nations. Formed in 1961, OECD sets international standards on a wide range of topics, including education spending. The most recent OECD study -- from 2014 using 2011 data -- shows that the United States spends $12,731 per student on secondary education. Four countries -- Austria, Luxembourg, Norway and Switzerland -- spend more. Those same countries are also the only ones that spend more than the United States per student on primary schools. Country Secondary per-pupil spending Austria $13,607 Luxembourg $16,182 Norway $13,939 Switzerland $15,891 United States $12,731 (Bush mentioned Liechtenstein, a tiny country located between Austria and Switzerland, but that wasn’t included on the OECD list.) Pointing to the OECD data, the federal government’s National Center for Education Statistics notes that a country’s wealth is positively associated with expenditures per student. When examining expenditures as a percentage of gross domestic product for all levels of education, the United States and Chile are seventh out of 32 countries. Stanford professor Eric Hanushek, an expert on economic analysis of educational issues, told PolitiFact that the OECD ranking is the best source currently available to judge differences among nations in education. However, University of Iowa education professor David Bills offered one caveat. "What matters is not the absolute budget per se, but the proportion of that budget that is spent on instruction," Bills said. Traditionally the United States spends big parts of its educational budget on non-instructional items such as security -- more so than some other nations. Bush has changed how he has worded his claim about how per-student spending in the United States compares to other countries. In 2013, Bush claimed that the United States spends "more per student than any country in the world," which Factcheck.org noted was inaccurate since a few countries spent more. Our ruling Bush said, "We have an 80 percent graduation rate in high school after spending more per student than any country in the world other than Liechtenstein, I think, or Luxembourg and a couple other small countries." The national average for the graduation rate was 81 percent in 2012-13, according to one method the federal government uses to calculate the rate. Among advanced countries, the United States ranked fifth in per student spending for secondary education behind Austria, Luxembourg, Norway and Switzerland. Liechtenstein wasn’t on the list, but since Bush expressed uncertainty, we think his statement is still accurate. We rate this claim True.

pomt-00887	The University of Wisconsin System "will be much more affordable than just about any other campus in America" because "going forward we have a cap on it tied to inflation."	false	/wisconsin/statements/2015/mar/09/scott-walker/scott-walker-uw-tuition-will-be-lower-just-about-a/	As Gov. Scott Walker’s presidential star continued to rise, Chris Wallace, host of Fox News Sunday, challenged him on how his budget treats the University of Wisconsin System. "You cut funding, state funding for the University of Wisconsin higher education system by 13 percent. You cut funding for the state parks system by 28 percent," Wallace said during the March 1, 2015 interview. "Governor, are those your priorities?" Walker responded by noting that critics said his 2011 budget cuts would devastate K-12 education, but graduation rates and reading scores are up. That led to this exchange: WALLACE: But the University of Wisconsin says they're going to have to raise tuition on students. WALKER: But they're not. We have a two-year tuition freeze. WALLACE: I know, but they're saying after that. WALKER: Going forward, we have a cap on it tied to inflation. And so, we will be much more affordable than just about any other campus in America. At issue are fears that big tuition hikes could be coming after 2017. They stem from Walker’s proposed Walker’s tuition freeze between 2015 and 2017, which would stymie UW from raising more revenue via tuition to replace the $300 million aid cut the governor wants. Walker is saying a big tuition increase won’t happen, and that UW schools will be near the top in affordability nationally. Let’s hit the books. We asked Kirsten Kukowski, a spokeswoman for Our American Revival, a group Walker formed as he explores a 2016 presidential bid, to back up Walker’s claim. She pointed us to 2014-’15 figures for tuition and fees at universities in other states compared with UW-Madison and at four-year public universities in Wisconsin as a group. The numbers come from a good source -- the College Board’s survey of college pricing trends. But Wisconsin is right in the middle of the pack or somewhat worse by various measures, the numbers show. -- All four-year schools: Among the states, Wisconsin’s average cost of in-state tuition and fees at these schools -- the "sticker price" at least -- ranked 26th highest. -- Flagship campuses: UW-Madison tuition and fees ranked 22nd highest compared to flagship campuses in the other 49 states. -- Two-year campuses: Wisconsin’s costs ranked 15th highest. Among four-year schools in the Big Ten (now with 14 schools), Nebraska, Iowa and Maryland charged less in 2014-’15 than Wisconsin. A gap of $2,000 to $3,000 a year separates Wisconsin and the least expensive states. Of course, nobody knows how the tuition rankings will look down the road after Walker’s freeze. But it would take a lot more than a freeze to put Wisconsin near the most affordable states. Cap on tuition? Next let’s look at Walker’s contention that "Going forward, we have a cap on it tied to inflation." The governor’s pending 2015-’17 budget plan would freeze tuition for the two years -- but it applies only to that period. Wallace, though, specifically asked about what happens after that. So that was the period Walker was citing when he referenced a "cap" going forward. Walker did suggest in February 2015 during a trade mission to the United Kingdom that he was "open" to the notion of putting an inflationary lid on tuition past 2016-’17. The idea drew criticism from UW-Madison Chancellor Rebecca Blank, who said it contradicted Walker’s plan to spin off the UW System as an independent authority with control over its budget and more ability to find efficiencies. In any case, no ongoing cap is in place. It’s not even formally introduced anywhere and Walker said he had no specific plan. So it’s not nearly the done deal Walker made it sound like. Our rating Walker said the University of Wisconsin schools "will be much more affordable than just about any other campus in America" because "going forward we have a cap on it tied to inflation." His evidence is current rankings, but they show the state is neither high nor low for student costs. And the inflationary cap the governor mentioned remains only a gleam in his eye. We rate his claim False. ------ More on Scott Walker For profiles and stories on Scott Walker and 2016 presidential politics, go to the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel's Scott Walker page.

pomt-05793	"Over 40 percent of children born in America are born out of wedlock."	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/feb/24/rick-santorum/rick-santorum-says-over-40-percent-children-are-bo/	During the Feb. 22, 2012, presidential debate in Mesa, Ariz., Rick Santorum offered extended comments on "the increasing number of children being born out of wedlock in America" and "teens who are sexually active." Santorum said, "What we're seeing is a problem in our culture with respect to children being raised by children, children being raised out of wedlock, and the impact on society economically, the impact on society with respect to drug use and all -- a host of other things when children have children. … Two days ago on the front page of the New York Times, they're talking about the same thing. The bottom line is we have a problem in this country, and the family is fracturing. "Over 40 percent of children born in America are born out of wedlock. How can a country survive if children are being raised in homes where it's so much harder to succeed economically? It's five times the rate of poverty in single-parent households than it is in two-parent homes. … We hear this all the time, cut spending, limit the government, everything will be fine. No, everything's not going to be fine." Santorum touched on a lot of issues -- and essentially sidestepped the question from moderator John King, who had reminded him that "you told an evangelical blog, if elected, you will talk about what, quote, 'no president has talked about before -- the dangers of contraception.' Why?" For this item, we’ll focus on the main statistic he offered -- that "over 40 percent of children born in America are born out of wedlock." Simply put, he’s right. According to 2009 data from the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 41 percent of all births were to unmarried women. The percentage has risen steadily since at least 1980, the earliest year for which data was provided in the CDC report. In 1980, it stood at 18.4 percent. By 1990, it was 28.0 percent. And by 2000 it was 33.2 percent. "It has been increasing over the last 50 years," said Tom W. Smith, a senior fellow at the National Opinion Research Center at the University of Chicago. While we’re on this topic, we’ll also look at an issue that Mitt Romney brought up later in the debate -- that "among certain ethnic groups, the vast majority born out of wedlock." This data is also included in the CDC report. In 2009, 17 percent of births to Asian-Pacific Islanders were out of wedlock, with non-Hispanic whites at 29 percent, 53 percent for Hispanics, 65 percent for American Indians and Native Alaskans and 73 percent for non-Hispanic blacks. So Romney’s claim would be accurate at least for American Indians and non-Hispanic blacks. Meanwhile, within age groups, unmarried births accounted for 87 percent of those to teenagers and 62 percent of births to women age 20 to 24. About 20 percent of births to women age 30 and over were to unmarried mothers. But births to unmarried teens as a percentage of all unmarried births has declined. Unmarried teen births (those to mothers from age 15 to 19) represented 21 percent of all unmarried births, which is far lower than the rate in 1970, which was 49 percent. Our ruling Federal data backs up Santorum’s contention that "over 40 percent of children born in America are born out of wedlock." In fact, the number for 2009, the most recent available, is a record high, based on the data included in the federal report. So we rate the statement True.

pomt-13431	"Latinos in Nevada support Educational Savings Accounts, helping more than 450,000 students access better schools. But Catherine Cortez Masto is against it."	mostly true	/nevada/statements/2016/sep/19/libre-initiative/group-correct-catherine-cortez-masto-opposes-new-s/	The conservative-leaning LIBRE Initiative is using a new school choice program as political ammunition in Nevada’s competitive U.S. Senate race. The grassroots nonprofit, which has financial ties to the billionaire Koch brothers, released a digital ad in English and Spanish on Sept. 13 accusing Democratic Senate candidate Catherine Cortez Masto of opposing an educational program favored by Hispanics. "Latinos in Nevada support Educational Savings Accounts, helping more than 450,000 students access better schools," the ad says. "But Catherine Cortez Masto is against it." The second part of the claim is not in dispute, as Cortez Masto clearly came out in opposition to the program in August, saying it diverts money from public schools. But the ad overstates the Latino support and the number of people who are set to benefit from the ESA program, which has been tied up in lawsuits almost immediately after being passed. ESA 411 Nevada lawmakers approved a bevy of new educational programs in 2015, but one of the most controversial has been the Education Savings Account program. Approved by Republican lawmakers on a party-line vote, the bill creates a program allowing parents to pull their children out of public schools and receive roughly $5,100 (about 90 percent of yearly per-pupil funding) a year to be used for private education expenses — private school tuition, textbooks, transportation, etc. It’s similar to a school voucher system, but program backers say the key difference is that the money is distributed through "education savings accounts," state-run accounts that reimburse parents for approved educational expenses. Other states have created similar programs, but Nevada is unique in that all parents can apply for the program regardless of income or any other factor. Several groups, including the American Civil Liberties Union’s Nevada branch, sued before the program could be implemented and successfully had a legal hold placed on the program. The state’s Supreme Court heard arguments on the program in late July, and both sides are still awaiting for a ruling from the court. Total enrollment Constant litigation hasn’t stopped the program from turning into political ad material. The ad text claims that "more than 450,000 students to benefit from school choice," citing a 2015 Lincoln County Register editorial. That’s the total number of students in Nevada (now closer to 467,000), but isn’t anywhere close to the actual number of program applicants, which numbers around 7,800 at the most recent count. The program is open to all students, but it is misleading to say that all of them will "benefit" from the program when the number of applicants is so small. LIBRE Initiative spokesman Wadi Gaitan said in an email that continuing legal uncertainty over the program means that the number of applicants is an "incomplete" barometer of who the program is helping, as presumably some parents are waiting for the dust to settle before deciding to enroll in the program. The ad’s vocal track differs from the text overlay as well, saying the program would help "more than 450,000 students access better schools." Again, there are no barriers for parents to apply for the program, but it’s a bit far-fetched to assume that it will give literally every student in the state access to the school of their choosing given that tuition alone tends to cost more than the projected ESA stipend. Average private school tuition in Las Vegas ranges from $8,700 to $9,600 a year, according to information from privateschoolreview.com. Demographic data released on program applicants shows that the majority of parents applying live in ZIP codes with higher-than-normal average household incomes (though income levels of applicants aren’t disclosed). The ad also cites a 2015 poll funded by the American Federation for Children, a conservative-leaning nonprofit that champions "school choice." The group found that 71 percent of Nevada Hispanics polled favored the program. More recent polling found that the program is still supported by voters, though not as strongly as the earlier poll suggests. A KTNV-TV 13 Action News/Rasmussen Reports poll from August found that Hispanic voters polled supported the program on a 47 to 35 percent basis, with 17 percent undecided. Our ruling A new ad from the LIBRE Initiative claims, "Latinos in Nevada support Educational Savings Accounts, helping more than 450,000 students access better schools. But Catherine Cortez Masto is against it." There’s no question that Cortez Masto opposes the ESA program. But the ad exaggerates the size and scope of the program itself. Only a fraction of the state's 450,000 students have actually applied to be part of the program. The ad also accurately cites polls showing Hispanic support for the program, though recent polls show more modest support. Because this ad is accurate but needs clarification, we rate it Mostly True. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/736fb02e-95c9-43ad-a5ea-ec50d5c4839b	None	LIBRE Initiative	None	None	None	2016-09-19T16:30:48	2016-09-13	['Nevada']

pomt-06999	"Mitt Romney is the first Massachusetts politician to run for president and not win the New Hampshire primary in a generation."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/jul/10/new-hampshire-democratic-party/democrats-say-mitt-romney-first-massachusetts-resi/	Mitt Romney, now competing in his second New Hampshire primary, considers himself more than a neighbor from the south. The former Massachusetts governor, who owns a home on New Hampshire’s Lake Winnipesaukee, likes to think of himself as one of the Granite State’s own. But state Democratic leaders were quick to point out last week that state voters haven’t always returned Romney’s affection. Speaking with reporters on a June 27, 2011, conference call, Democratic Party Chairman Ray Buckley said Romney, who placed second in the 2008 primary, was the first Bay State politician in decades who failed to win the New Hampshire primary. "It's important to note that Mitt Romney is the first Massachusetts politician to run for president and not win the New Hampshire primary in a generation," Buckley said. "The people of New Hampshire know him very well." PolitiFact decided to check the record books. Prior to Romney’s last run in 2008, the last three Massachusetts politicians to run for the Oval Office all got off to good starts by winning the New Hampshire primary, according to state voting records. In 2004, John Kerry, the U.S. Senator from Massachusetts, won the Democratic primary, defeating former Vermont Gov. Howard Dean, among other candidates. Twelve years earlier, in 1992, U.S. Sen. Paul Tsongas defeated Bill Clinton to win the primary; and four years prior to that, Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis won the primary on his way to the 1988 Democratic nomination. Political analysts say all three Massachusetts residents took advantage of the physical -- and philosophical -- proximity of the two states. Voters from both states tend to hold common cultural values, political attitudes and histories, according to Andrew Smith, director of the University of New Hampshire Survey Center. And, because much of southern New Hampshire, the state’s most populous area, falls within the Boston media market, Granite State voters are often familiar with Massachusetts candidates even before election season begins, added David King, a lecturer at Harvard University’s Kennedy School of Government. But the home court advantage doesn’t help all Massachusetts candidates. Indeed, you need only go back to 1980, when U.S. Sen. Edward Kennedy lost his bold bid to unseat President Jimmy Carter. So it was 28 years between that loss and Romney's. Does that count as "a generation"? To find out, we asked the experts. Genealogists across the country don’t have a set definition for the length of a generation, the time between the birth of a parent and that parent’s child. We found a range of answers from 20 to 30 years. Ancestry.com, a national genealogical website, considers a generation as 25 years; the New England Genealogical Society accepts a generation as 25 to 30 years, and the U.S. Genealogical Society extends it between 20 and 30 years. "Anywhere between twenty and thirty years seems to be the standard, but there is no hard and fast rule," said Laura Prescott, a Brookline, New Hampshire resident and president of the Association of Professional Genealogists. "It’s something that changes over time, and it’s an inexact science." Our ruling Buckley said Romney was the first candidate to lose "in a generation." Buckley is right if you rely on the shorter time period of 20 or 25 years, but he is off if you rely on the 30-year standard. Even so, he wouldn't be that far off, and his underlying point is correct that Romney's 2008 loss was unusual by historical standards. So we find his claim Mostly True.

pomt-05843	Says U.S. Rep. Tammy Baldwin, a candidate for Senate, supports raising taxes "by $858 billion."	mostly false	/wisconsin/statements/2012/feb/15/us-chamber-commerce/us-chamber-says-rep-tammy-baldwin-backed-raising-t/	There was never any doubt that opponents of U.S. Rep. Tammy Baldwin of Wisconsin, a Madison Democrat running for the U.S. Senate, would brand her as a liberal who loves taxes. On the day Baldwin announced her candidacy in September 2011, Republican Senate candidate Tommy Thompson called her the most liberal member of the House. Based on annual ratings of House members’ votes, we gave Thompson a Mostly True on that claim. Now two major business organizations say Baldwin loves taxes enough to raise them "by $858 billion" -- and they cite Baldwin’s own website as evidence. A politician touting an $858 billion tax increase? This could get interesting. The claim is made in a TV ad sponsored by Wisconsin Manufacturers and Commerce and paid for by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. The ad was released Feb. 9, 2012. It begins with a narrator saying: "Washington has made things tough for job creators. More red tape doesn't help. ‘Obamacare’ will kill jobs; Tammy Baldwin fought hard for it. Taxes? Tammy Baldwin thinks they're too low and wants to raise them." At that point, a message on the screen reads: "Tammy Baldwin -- raise taxes by $858 billion" and lists Baldwin’s official House website as the source. Is it an accurate attack? ‘Bush-era tax cuts’ The Wisconsin business group referred us to the U.S. Chamber, which referred us to the taxes page on Baldwin’s website. It discusses her vote against an $858 billion bill that extended what are known as the Bush-era tax cuts. The tax cuts -- on income, capital gains, dividends and business -- were enacted in 2001 and 2003 under President George W. Bush. They were temporary -- their major provisions were to expire at the end of 2010. The bill Baldwin voted against was adopted and signed into law in December 2010. On the web page cited by the chamber, Baldwin says she supported continuing the tax cuts only for families that earn up to $250,000, because "adding $858 billion to the national debt just to give a special tax break to those with incomes over $250,000 is fiscally irresponsible." The ad’s claim about Baldwin is based on that single no vote. But, as we’ll see, it wasn’t the only measure put to a vote in the House on extending the Bush tax cuts. And the $858 billion figure -- though widely cited -- is more complicated than presented in the ad. What’s in the $858 billion The law extends the Bush tax cuts two more years -- but it also provided a new, temporary payroll tax cut, made other tax changes and extended unemployment benefits for 13 months. The total "cost" of the package -- in terms of how much it adds to federal budget deficits -- is estimated at nearly $858 billion over 10 years, according to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office. About $721 billion of that is reduced revenue from the tax changes -- including $408 billion from the two-year extension of the Bush tax cuts -- and the rest is from additional spending. So, does Baldwin’s vote against an $858 billion bill composed primarily of tax cuts mean she supported raising taxes by $858 billion? Not exactly. Had Baldwin’s side defeated the bill -- and had the Bush tax cuts been allowed to expire -- the people who benefited from those tax cuts would have been paying higher taxes as of January 2011. But, as we’ve noted, the bill also contained other measures such as the new cut in payroll taxes and the extension of unemployment benefits. So, it can’t be argued that taxes would have been raised by a full $858 billion had Baldwin’s side prevailed. Secondly, had the $858 billion bill been defeated, it doesn’t necessarily mean the debate would have ended and that the Bush tax cuts would have expired; another bill could have emerged. Baldwin campaign spokesman Phil Walzak pointed out that a week before the vote on the $858 billion bill that became law, Baldwin voted for an alternative that would have extended the Bush tax cuts, permanently, for families earning less than $250,000. The failed measure also would have made other changes that would have added a total of $1.5 trillion to the deficit over 10 years, according to the Congressional Budget Office. Nearly all of that, $1.34 trillion, would have been revenue lost from making most of the Bush tax cuts permanent. To compare the two bills only in terms of extending the Bush tax cuts: The bill Baldwin voted against reduces revenue by $408 billion for two years, or $204 billion on an annual basis. The bill Baldwin voted for would have reduced revenue $1.34 trillion over 10 years, or $134 billion per year. So, Baldwin supported extending most of the Bush tax cuts, although taxes would have gone up for families earning $250,000 or more. In the end, there were two votes on competing proposals. By using the approach the ad uses, Democrats would be able to argue that those who voted against the first, more limited package, opposed cutting taxes. Our ruling In a TV ad, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce says Baldwin supports raising taxes by $858 billion, citing her vote against a bill that primarily contained tax cuts. It’s true that had Baldwin’s side prevailed and if no other action was taken, taxes would have increased, although not by the full $858 billion. But Baldwin did vote separately for a measure that would have extended most of the Bush tax cuts. And it can’t be assumed that the Bush tax cuts would not have been extended had the bill Baldwin opposed not become law. There’s only an element of truth in the chamber’s claim, which is our definition for Mostly False.

pomt-11396	"Since taking office, Andrew Cuomo has given massive tax breaks to corporations and the super rich."	mostly false	/new-york/statements/2018/mar/23/cynthia-nixon/cynthia-nixon-claims-cuomo-has-helped-corporations/	Actress Cynthia Nixon quickly went on the attack against Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo when she announced she would run against him in a primary for governor. Nixon, a Democrat, portrayed the incumbent as a career politician who has spent his time in office pandering to corporations and the wealthy and passing legislation for their benefit, Nixon said. "Since taking office, Andrew Cuomo has given massive tax breaks to corporations and the super rich," Nixon said. Nixon’s campaign staff said she was talking about cuts to the state’s corporate tax rate and changes to the state’s tax code that favored wealthy filers. Cuomo and state lawmakers have reduced income tax rates for middle-class earners. PolitiFact New York checked Cuomo's claim that middle-class New York State residents will have the "lowest tax rate in 70 years" and found his statement to be Mostly True. Cuomo has also said "taxes for every New Yorker are lower today than when I started." PolitiFact New York ruled that it’s true income taxes for individuals, corporations, and manufacturers are lower than when he took office in 2011. But it ruled that statement Half True because property taxes are higher. But has he given "massive tax breaks" to corporations and high-income earners? Corporate taxes The state tax rate on corporations when Cuomo took office was 7.1 percent. State lawmakers struck a deal with Cuomo during the 2014 state budget that cut the rate to 6.5 percent, the lowest in almost half a century. The corporate tax rate for manufacturers was eliminated altogether. The deal also affected the estate tax -- a tax on one’s property and assets after death before inheritance. The tax applied to anyone with an estate worth more than $1 million before the deal. The state now only taxes estates worth more than about $5.2 million. The 'super rich’ Cutting corporate tax rates can help wealthy earners. As we have reported before, lower corporate taxes benefit wealthy shareholders of those companies. But aside from the higher estate tax threshold, Cuomo has not provided any "massive tax breaks" to super-rich earners. Even the estate tax benefit is questionable, said E.J. McMahon, research director at the Empire Center, a state fiscal watchdog group. "The estate tax reform did not save a penny for the super-rich," McMahon said. "The rate and scope of the tax on the largest estates is unchanged from before 2014." In 2011, Cuomo wanted to let the state’s so-called "millionaires tax" expire. Filers who reported more than $500,000 in state income would have seen their state tax rate fall from 8.97 percent to 6.85 percent if the tax expired. Democrats in the Assembly wanted to keep the "millionaires tax." In the end, Cuomo agreed to keep the tax but lowered the rate from 8.97 percent to 8.82 percent for the state’s highest earners. "By no stretch of the imagination is this a massive tax break for the super-rich," McMahon said. "In fact, in the dictionary definition of the term, there hasn’t been a ‘massive’ tax cut for anyone." One group did see a tax cut. The millionaires tax now only applies to single filers who earn more than about $1 million and married couples whose combined income exceeds about $2 million. The previous law imposed the millionaires tax on couples when their income was more than $500,000. Other tax cuts Nixon’s campaign also pointed to tax breaks for banks and real estate developers. Lawmakers repealed part of the tax law that determined how much state tax banks had to pay in 2014. Banks were instead added to the corporate tax code, which changed how much of their income was subject to state tax. That meant lower taxes for banks headquartered in New York state. Cuomo also approved legislation that gave tax breaks to five major real estate developers in New York City. A provision to waive property taxes for five projects over a decade was tucked into an omnibus housing bill in 2012. One developer was expected to save $35 million on a luxury apartment tower in Manhattan, for example. Cuomo was criticized for accepting campaign donations from the developers shortly before the bill was signed. Our ruling "Since taking office, Andrew Cuomo has given massive tax breaks to corporations and the super rich," Nixon said in a speech announcing her candidacy. Cuomo has approved a tax cut for corporations since taking office, and the new rates will be the lowest in decades. Some wealthy earners also have lower state income tax rates today than when Cuomo took office. But the tax breaks hven't been huge and, with one exception, hven't been for the "super rich." A higher tax rate for the wealthiest earners has continued under Cuomo and no other major tax breaks for those filers are apparent. We rate her claim Mostly False.

pomt-04354	Elizabeth Townsend runs the elections office that omitted a school board race on a ballot and gave a School Board candidate "faulty advice."	mostly false	/florida/statements/2012/oct/23/shirley-anderson/herando-county-candidate-claims-rival-supervisor-e/	Hernando supervisor of elections candidate Elizabeth Townsend stood on stage at a recent political forum and defended herself against the way she was portrayed in recent flier distributed by her opponent, Shirley Anderson. "Elizabeth Townsend Runs The Office That . . ." the mailer reads in large yellow letters. Below the statement are excerpts from newspaper articles highlighting recent problems with the elections office. One headline reads, "Ballot omits school race." Another states "Faulty advice, political disaster / An election official steers School Board hopeful William Kingeter wrong." In this fact-check, we will examine the claim that Townsend runs the office. We'll also explore what role she had in the recent issues excerpted on the mailer. • • • Townsend has been the director of operations for the elections office since December 2010. The official job description for the position includes a list of more than 30 responsibilities. These include everything from informing and training staff on office procedures to ensuring that redistricting is carried out after each national census to knowing and understanding Florida election laws. Nowhere does it say the director of operations runs the office. The job description clearly denotes that the person in the position serves the supervisor of elections. The operations director, according to the description, is responsible for "performing assigned responsibilities effectively and efficiently within the framework set forth by the Supervisor of Elections." It also states the director will perform "other duties as assigned" and will handle "speaking engagements unless the Supervisor of Elections states otherwise." Hernando Supervisor of Elections Annie Williams took issue with the claim Anderson makes in the flier. "Liz does not run the office," she said. "I am ultimately responsible for everything that goes on in here." She added: "As far as running the office, Annie Williams is in charge of running the Supervisor of Elections Office." Between the job description and the statements from Williams, the answer of who runs the office seems clear-cut. But it gets a bit more complicated. In at least two places, Townsend has claimed to run or operate the Supervisor of Elections Office. When asked why she said Townsend runs the office, Anderson pointed to these statements. "I have run this office in a nonpartisan manner and have proven I will continue to do so by treating all voters and candidates with dignity and respect regardless of party affiliation," Townsend claims as part of her candidate statement on the Hernando elections office's website. On her campaign website, elizabethtownsend.org, she writes: "Currently as the Director of Operations, I: Operate the elections office in an efficient, fiscally responsible, nonpartisan manner." Williams disagreed with these characterizations. "That's somewhat overstated, yes," she said. Townsend said Williams runs the office. "My responsibilities obviously encompass things that are part of that office. It would be impossible to separate the two," she said in an email. "I operate and carry out my responsibilities within the framework that the supervisor of election sets. She runs the office." Said Anderson: "If (Townsend) is now trying to convince people that she does not oversee the daily operations of this office, then she has clearly embellished her resume." • • • So what about Townsend's role in the two incidents highlighted in the mailer? The July 26 headline, "Faulty advice, political disaster," refers to an incident where Williams mistakenly gave School Board candidate William Kingeter the incorrect election date after misreading Florida Statutes. Williams told him he would appear on the Nov. 6 general election ballot when School Board races were actually on the Aug. 14 primary ballot. Kingeter said the error cost him valuable campaign time. Williams admitted to making the mistake. In addition, Kingeter verified that Townsend did not give him the misinformation. Townsend's only involvement came later when she found out about the mistake. She called the candidate and provided him the correct information. The story "Ballot omits school race" highlights an incident that came shortly before the primary election. In it, one School Board race was omitted from one voting machine. A vendor failed to load the latest information, according to a news release provided by Advanced Ballot Solutions, the vendor. "It was identified that the ballot file installed on one of your systems by ABS was not updated with the official ballot for Style 31N1, as provided to us by the Hernando County Supervisor of Elections," it reads. The person who got the first incorrect ballot, School Board member Dianne Bonfield, noticed the problem and alerted the office. The problem was fixed, and no other voters were affected. Bonfield was eventually able to cast a correct ballot. The Tampa Bay Times asked Anderson if she had information connecting Townsend to these incidents. "Nowhere on the mailer did it say that she contributed directly to these gaffes," she wrote in an email. "You did." Our ruling Anderson's flier claims Townsend runs the elections office. That overstates her opponent's role. Both Townsend's job description and her boss make it very clear: The supervisor of elections runs the Supervisor of Elections Office. But Townsend also stretched the truth by claiming to run or operate the office. They are both misleading statements. As for connecting Townsend to the incidents cited in the mailer, Anderson misleads voters. Townsend had no role in them. For stretching the truth and misleading voters, PolitiFact rates this claim Mostly False.	None	Shirley Anderson	None	None	None	2012-10-23T17:22:08	2012-10-17	['None']
pomt-09035	"I’m running against a groundhog. He saw his shadow on the primary day, and no one has seen him since."	mostly false	/texas/statements/2010/jul/06/jeff-weems/democrat-jeff-weems-says-republican-foe-has-been-o/	Houston lawyer Jeff Weems, the Democratic nominee for a seat on the Texas Railroad Commission, says his November opponent is so low, he’s below ground. "I’m running against a groundhog," Weems said June 26 at the Texas Democratic Party’s convention in Corpus Christi. "He saw his shadow on the primary day, and no one has seen him since." Say what? Weems had already flashed a flair for appellations; he called his opponent a "potted plant" in June 25 remarks to the convention’s United Auto Workers caucus. Later, he told us in an e-mail he’s crossed paths with GOP nominee David Porter only once since the March 2 primaries; the two spoke separately at an April event in Wichita Falls. Weems said Porter’s campaign website and Facebook page reflect "a similar lack of activity." He said the online Texas Tribune "has been trying to schedule a debate or meeting or panel discussion with the two of us, but his campaign will not return their phone calls." Michael Blunk, Weems’ campaign assistant, followed up in an e-mail, saying: "We call David a groundhog because he's not showing his face any more, he went back into hiding." Porter, a CPA who lives in Giddings but has long practiced in Midland, hasn’t proved a media hound before or after upsetting the better-funded GOP incumbent, Victor Carrillo, in their primary, a search for news articles suggests. Shortly after the primary, the Midland Reporter-Telegram quoted Porter, who had long been a local businessman, insisting he wasn’t running a stealth campaign; the candidate was quoted saying he’d done mailouts, in-person campaigning and made online efforts to reach voters before the primary. Using the Nexis search tool, we found 17 articles about Porter and the railroad commission published from January until the March primary. From then through June, there have been 41 articles or blogs mentioning Porter and the commission, most of them reflecting on Carrillo’s loss. Our search yielded one mention of a Porter campaign stop; on April 18, the Wichita Falls Times Record News included a sentence about Weems and Porter appearing at the April 21 Alliance of Energy Producers meeting in Wichita Falls. Of course, minimal news coverage doesn’t prove a candidate is deliberately out of sight. A Nexis search for articles on Weems and the commission from January through June delivered 34 results. Down-ballot candidates nearly always draw less attention than, say, aspirants for governor or the U.S. Senate. To get a feel for Porter’s online outreach, we read his Twitter posts. Snippets: On March 3, Porter announced Barry Williamson, a former railroad commissioner, as his campaign chairman; on May 20, the candidate said he was heading to a GOP meeting in Lee County; on June 17, he hailed the backing of Michael Williams, current commissioner; and on June 28, Porter wrote: "Last week was busy with several meetings in Houston, and Austin and ending up Saturday night at the Bastrop Tea Party with about 250 people." About 15 minutes later, he wrote: "Know of an event I should attend? Please email Info@VoteDavidPorter.com." Seeking other signs of campaign activity, we looked at Porter’s campaign site, which didn’t list any events. So, stealth candidate after all? Not so, said Corbin Casteel of Austin, Porter’s general consultant. Casteel said Porter has been balancing a wind-down of his accounting business with politics; during May and June the candidate made 33 campaign stops in nine counties including Bastrop, Travis, Tarrant, Dallas and Harris. "It’s all energy (group) meetings and GOP leader meetings," Casteel said. Casteel declined to share details of the stops, saying that would play into Weems’ hands. "We’re not going to let him bait you into us releasing (Porter’s) political activity," Casteel said. Ahead, Casteel said, Porter plans to attend events hosted by the Texas Independent Producers and Royalty Owners Association and natural gas companies and he’ll make a tour of more than 40 counties. Casteel called Weems’ claim Porter has not returned the Tribune’s calls "a lie." Ross Ramsey, the Tribune’s managing editor, said it hasn’t had communication difficulties with either campaign. One event Porter likely won’t join: a debate. "Jeff Weems is a litigator," Casteel said. "David Porter is an accountant. Why would we put our candidate in that position, to stand in front of a podium?" We asked about Porter’s infrequent Twitter posts. Casteel said: "David is being true to himself and who he is as a person and candidate. He’s not going to use social media in a way to produce faux activity." Trying another tack, we contacted officials with groups that watch the commission closely. Bill Stevens, executive vice president of the energy alliance, said that since the primary, Porter has participated in a 30-minute conference call with the alliance and came to its Wichita Falls meeting. Wayne Hughes, executive vice president of the Panhandle Producers & Royalty Owners Association, said Porter provided answers for a questionnaire printed in the group’s May newsletter. Asked if the GOP hopeful has otherwise seemed out of sight, Hughes replied: "We don’t have any guidelines for judging Mr. Porter’s appropriateness as a candidate. We feel like we have a clear picture of what Mr. Weems is all about and his appropriateness as a candidate. Can I stop there?" We informed Weems of the activities summarized by Porter's campaign. He stood by his convention critique. Our suss: Porter has kept a low profile, but that does not a Punxsutawney candidate make. The Democrat's statement is Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.

pomt-02644	On foreign policy, Joe Biden was against aid for Vietnam, said the fall of the Shah was "a step forward" for human rights in Iran, opposed Reagan's defense build-up and voted against the first Gulf War.	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2014/jan/16/robert-gates/robert-gates-criticism-vice-president-joe-biden/	A new memoir from former Defense Secretary Robert Gates hit the book shelves this month, drawing both praise and criticism for its candid insights into the two most recent presidents Gates worked for, George W. Bush and Barack Obama, and their administrations. Washington reporters immediately latched on to Gates’ portrayal of Vice President Joe Biden. Biden, he said, is a nice guy — "simply impossible not to like" — but "wrong on nearly every major foreign policy and national security issue over the past four decades." Ouch. Asked to back up his harsh words Jan. 13, 2014, on National Public Radio’s Morning Edition, Gates replied: "Frankly, I believe it. The vice president, when he was a senator — a very new senator — voted against the aid package for South Vietnam, and that was part of the deal when we pulled out of South Vietnam to try and help them survive. He said that when the Shah fell in Iran in 1979 that that was a step forward for progress toward human rights in Iran. He opposed virtually every element of President Reagan's defense build-up. He voted against the B-1, the B-2, the MX and so on. He voted against the first Gulf War. So on a number of these major issues, I just frankly, over a long period of time, felt that he had been wrong." This is not an argument without consequence. Biden served for years on the Foreign Relations Committee, including several stints as chairman, and he was picked as Obama’s running mate in part because of his experience in world affairs. For someone of Gates’ stature to publicly criticize a sitting vice president is uncommon. We can’t — and won’t — weigh in on whether Biden was on the right or wrong side of history. That’s a debate that likely will never end. Nor are we stipulating that Gates’ examples are the definitive list by which the last 40 years of U.S. foreign relations will be judged. But we did wonder if Gates’ description of Biden’s history was accurate. That led us to this review of the career of a man who first entered the Senate in 1973 and who twice has acted on his presidential ambitions and may again in 2016. History between Biden and Gates Biden won his first election in 1972 at just 29, fueled by the anti-war sentiments of a generation wary of the Vietnam conflict. Biden later said he "wasn’t against the war for moral reasons; I just thought it was stupid policy." At other times in his career, Biden advocated for military intervention. Most notably, Biden was an early and instrumental advocate of military intervention in the Serbia and Kosovo conflicts during the Clinton administration. He reportedly called Yugoslavian leader Slobodan Milosevic "a damn war criminal" to his face and later said his work in the Balkans was one of his two "proudest moments in public life." Biden and Gates have not always disagreed. In his memoir Duty: Memoirs of a Secretary at War, Gates recalled fighting military leaders in 2007 to get more money to protect troops on the ground against roadmines. It was Biden who offered an amendment to fund Mine Resistant Ambush Protected vehicles to the tune of $1.5 billion. It passed unanimously. But there’s clearly tension between Gates and Biden. Gates wrote that just sitting next to Biden was "awkward" because they so frequently were at odds. Biden is mentioned on nearly six dozen pages of Gates’ 600-page memoir, often in an unflattering light. Biden, too, has not always been so kind to Gates. When President George H.W. Bush nominated Gates to director of the Central Intelligence Agency in 1991, Biden not only voted against his confirmation, he openly criticized Gates. "I believe it is time for us to look forward. I have been disappointed in the past in Mr. Gates’ analytical skills, especially in regard to the Soviet Union," Biden said, according to the Senate record. "I have chosen to err on the side of new thinking." A few minutes later, Gates won confirmation by a vote of 64-31. When Gates was confirmed overwhelmingly by the Senate 95-2 to Secretary of Defense under the second Bush, Biden was one of three senators not to vote. Clearly, these two men have some history. But what about Gates’ claims regarding Biden’s record? Let’s go through them one by one. Biden "voted against the aid package for South Vietnam." On April 10, 1975, President Gerald Ford requested Congress to provide nearly $1 billion in military and humanitarian aid to South Vietnam within nine days. By this point, American intervention in Vietnam was waning after two decades of involvement, and Ford’s request was the final attempt to bring U.S. assistance to the war-torn country. On April 25, 1975, the Senate approved a conference report to provide some financial assistance on a 46-17 vote. Biden, just two years after taking office, voted against the measure. The bill ultimately died in the House. And on April 29, as the South Vietnam capital of Saigon was captured, Ford order an evacuation of all remaining U.S. personnel from Indochina. Biden said when "the Shah fell in Iran in … 1979 ... that that was a step forward for progress toward human rights in Iran." We were not able to find evidence that Biden spoke positively of the fall of the Shah. Mohammad Reza Shah Pahlavi was the leader of Iran until January 1979, when he and his family were forced out of the country by backers of Ruhollah Mostafavi Musavi Khomeini, an exiled cleric critical of the regime. Khomeini returned to the country in February 1979 to claim power as supreme leader and proclaim the Islamic Republic of Iran, the state it remains in today. An extensive search through newspaper archives found no instances of Biden speaking positively of the Shah’s ouster. Jules Witcover, author of Joe Biden: A Life of Trial and Redemption, does not recall coming across such a statement in his research, either. We found reference to the statement in a 2008 opinion piece published by the New York Post that heavily criticized Obama’s choice of Biden as his VP. But there was no source for it. The comment has continued to circulate in conservative media, again without citation. We contacted both the Post and the author to ask for a source, but we didn’t hear back. Through a publicist, we asked Gates to back up the claim. They simply referred us back to his book. We found no other source for this statement, and especially no original citation, so we have significant doubts that it’s accurate. We will update this point if more evidence comes to light. Biden "opposed virtually every element of President Reagan's defense build-up. He voted against the B-1, the B-2, the MX and so on." Following World War II, the United States’ approach to the Soviet Union and the spread of communism centered on containment. President Ronald Reagan changed that, said Barry Watts, a senior fellow at the Center for Strategic and Budgetary Assessments, a national security think tank. "If you read through key national security documents written under Reagan, they basically turn their back on containment and say, ‘we can win this thing,’" Watts said. "And the defense build-up under Reagan is the concrete substantiation to put increased pressure on (the Soviets)." During the next eight years, Reagan would push Congress to spend hundreds of billions of dollars on defense. One such proposal was to bring back the B-1 bomber, a plane canceled under President Jimmy Carter. On Dec. 3, 1981, Biden voted for an amendment to eliminate funds for the B-1 from the defense appropriation bill. The amendment failed, and the defense spending bill passed the Senate a day later with $2.4 billion for the B-1. Biden did not vote on the Senate bill. The same bill also contained $2 billion for the MX, an intercontinental ballistic missile known as the "Peacekeeper." Biden voted for an amendment that would have eliminated some funding for the MX, which failed. The B-2, also known as the "Stealth bomber," was a secret project for much of the 1980s. Funding for the project was included in the 1987 defense spending bill, but the amount was classified. Biden voted for the final bill, but we could not find his position on that particular appropriation. However, from 1989 to 1992, Biden continually voted for measures that stripped funding from the B-2 project, according to voting record scorecards kept by the Council for a Livable World, a group that advocates for nuclear arms control. As for the rest of the defense build-up, Biden voted in favor of the final military spending compromise resolutions passed by Congress throughout the Reagan years, his office noted. But he also often voted against many of the administration’s military priorities during the amendment phase. Biden annually earned high ratings in the 1980s voting scorecards from the Council for a Livable World, which generally opposed Reagan’s defense build-up. The exception was in 1987 and 1988, when he earned low marks after missing many of the votes while running for president. Biden "voted against the first Gulf War." Biden was a staunch opponent of the first invasion of Iraq in 1991 under President George H.W. Bush. The day before the vote, he delivered a blistering speech against the war and accused Bush of threatening to usurp the constitution to commit troops without congressional consent. But Biden was not alone in his dissent. The House had its longest debate in the history of the chamber in deciding whether to go to war, according to the Los Angeles Times, and the Senate only narrowly passed the joint resolution authorizing use of force in Iraq, 52-47. Biden voted no, citing a torn Congress and country. "Even if you win today, you still lose," Biden said on the day of the vote. "The nation is divided on this issue." Our ruling Gates’ assessments of Biden’s positions on South Vietnamese aid, the Reagan defense build-up and the first Gulf War are accurate, according to our research. However, we found no solid evidence that Biden actually said the fall of the Shah was a step forward for human rights in Iran. Experts will continue to debate whether foreign policy decisions of Gates and Biden will be viewed favorably by historians. But Gates portrayal of Biden’s record was accurate, with the exception of the unproven claim about Biden’s comments on Iran. We rate Gates’ statement Mostly True.

pomt-01785	"The increase in the garbage tax that [Mayor Allan Fung] imposed in Cranston for some people has been as much as $200."	false	/rhode-island/statements/2014/jul/27/kenneth-block/ken-block-says-cranston-mayor-allan-fung-increased/	Cranston’s new automated trash collection system, approved in February, is just getting under way, but it has already raised a stink. Ken Block, a Republican candidate for governor, argues that the new program comes at an additional cost. He claims that Cranston Mayor Allan Fung, his gubernatorial primary opponent, has raised "the garbage tax" by "as much as $200 for some residents." Block raised the issue during a debate with Fung on Rhode Island Public Radio on July 15, 2014. When it was Block’s turn to ask Fung a question, he said, "You know, I’ve heard from a number of Cranston residents, including a few CPAs, that the increase in the garbage tax that you’ve imposed in Cranston for some people has been as much as $200 dollars. And for a number of people in Cranston, that’s equivalent to what is in effect a five-percent increase in their property tax … "So my question to you is: When you talk about not increasing taxes but you’re charging some people the equivalent of 5 percent increase in property taxes, with $200 to collect garbage where they paid much less than the year before, how do you explain that, and do you think that’s acceptable? I hear from a ton of people we talked to in Cranston; they’re very unhappy with this." In response, Fung said he’d heard from many residents that they’re happy with the new system. "I’m not sure where you’re talking about a garbage tax," he said. "We haven’t raised taxes." Garbage tax? $200 increase? Equivalent to 5-percent tax increase? Is this just a lot of trash talk? Here are the facts, according to the city’s website and the mayor’s office: Cranston’s new automated trash pickup system,which started in June, is intended to boost the city’s recycling rate from 23 percent to the state’s goal of 35 percent and potentially earn rebates; keep the city cleaner by using closed containers; and reduce the rodent population by using the largely chew-proof barrels. All in all, it should make for a cleaner, sweeter-smelling Cranston with an eased "critter" problem. As part of the program, Cranston residents have received two new, free 65-gallon rolling barrels, one for trash, the other for recyclables. Residents can opt for smaller, 35-gallon bins if the larger ones are too unwieldy. Residents who want a third barrel must pay $150 per year. There’s another change: the city no longer removes bulky items and appliances for free. Residents must pay $18 per bulky item, and $25 per mattress or box spring. The bottom line: There is no new "garbage tax," but there new fees for services that were free before. Now let’s examine Block’s claim. When we asked the Block campaign what he was talking about, they emailed us a five-page response, contending that he was referring to the charge for the optional extra barrels, and the new removal fees for bulky items. We should note that, in his back-and-forth with Fung, Block at one point said: "You don’t want to call it a tax - let’s call it a fee. They’re now paying a fee …" But he also used the words "tax" or "taxes" six times in roughly 30 seconds. In his email, Block explained his math. "The fact of the matter is that the citizens of Cranston are paying much more for trash removal than they were in the prior year when it was already done as a service paid for by their tax dollars," Block wrote. "Collectively every household that has an extra bin ($150), plus any household that has a large curbside item ($18 per item) adds up to a sum of money that Cranston taxpayers are collectively paying for out of pocket that they didn’t pay for the year before -- call it a fee, call it a tax, call it whatever, but many Cranston residents are now paying more for trash service than they were a year ago." As for the five percent: "If a homeowner has an annual property tax bill of $4,000 and he/she needs to purchase an extra bin, and also pay for three curbside items, "then he /she is paying approximately $300 in new fees, which is a 5% increase over their $4,000 tax bill." OK, but just a second. How many is "many" when we’re talking about people paying for additional bins? Block cites 2008 Environmental Protection Agency estimates that each person in the U.S. "creates a daily average of 4.5 pounds of solid waste." From that, Block extrapolates that "each person creates approximately 30 pounds of solid waste per week" in concluding that "larger families will need an extra bin or bins." Block also noted that the 65-gallon barrels provided in Cranston are smaller than the 90-gallon barrels provided in nearby Warwick. And he noted that residents who previously could discard bulky items such as sofas, carpets and mattresses will now have to pay extra fees. It’s a little early to predict how many people in Cranston will be paying extra for bulky waste or renting extra bins. But to date, out of 28,600 residential units that have received barrels, only 80 have requested an additional trash bin - or 0.3 percent, the mayor says. Fung also called Block’s statement "false in a number of respects" and noted that there hasn’t been an increase in property taxes for three years. "So even if a portion of the regular property tax were to be segregated or designated as paying for refuse removal services, the statement that there has been an ‘increase’ is false, because the overall tax rate has stayed constant for three consecutive years," he said. Our ruling During a radio debate, Ken Block said, "The increase in the garbage tax that [Mayor Allan Fung] imposed in Cranston for some people has been as much as $200." He then mentioned the word "tax or taxes" five more times. But there is no garbage tax. And only those who request an extra barrel or are discarding bulky items and mattresses will pay any extra fees. In fairness, Block later used the word "fee," and "additional fee." But we believe the average listener would conclude that Block was talking about a hike in -- or extra fee beyond -- an existing "garbage tax." In addition, Block’s claim that "many Cranston residents are now paying more for trash service than they were a year ago," is sweeping generalization. Only 80 residents have so far requested an extra barrel. We won’t say that Block’s claim is a whole lot of garbage. But it certainly misleads and exaggerates. We rule his statement False.

pomt-00275	Says Democratic North Carolina House candidate Dan McCready "took money from the Pelosi crowd" and is "with them" in their agenda and "wants to repeal your tax cut."	half-true	/north-carolina/statements/2018/oct/02/mark-harris/powered-pelosi/	How genuine is a Democrat who talks like a conservative? In an ad, Mark Harris, a former pastor and Republican candidate in North Carolina’s 9th Congressional District, holds up two blue T-shirts to raise that question. One is light blue, the other royal blue — but hues can deceive, he suggests. In other words, Harris’s Democratic opponent, businessman Dan McCready, isn’t showing his true colors. McCready "talks like a conservative but is shading the truth," Harris tells viewers. "He donated to Hillary Clinton. Took money from the Pelosi crowd. McCready’s team wants to grow government, and repeal your tax cut. He’s with them, no matter how he tries to color it." Conservative and liberal shadings play a role in this race. The seat has been held by Republicans since 1963 but suddenly is competitive. McCready, the Democrat, says that if elected, he won't vote for Nancy Pelosi for House Democratic leader, or House speaker if the party wins a majority. But Harris says McCready is just trying to hide that he is "with" the "Pelosi crowd." So we took a look at the ad’s factual claims to find out. The money Federal campaign records show McCready, a Marine veteran, Harvard MBA and investor in solar farms, donated to Hillary Clinton’s campaign in 2016. He gave $500 to Clinton’s presidential campaign and $500 to the Hillary Victory Fund, a fundraising entity that gave proceeds to Clinton, the Democratic National Committee and state Democratic parties across the country. But what about the "Pelosi crowd?" We asked the Harris campaign and the National Republican Congressional Committee, which supports Republican candidates. They cited donations to McCready by Democrats on Pelosi’s leadership team. They also said the House Majority PAC, a leading super PAC spending heavily to elect Democrats, has spent money in the race. Tallies tracked by the Center for Responsive Politics show the House Majority PAC has spent $327,925 to oppose Harris. Technically, this is not Pelosi’s PAC, but it is considered affiliated. It works on the same goal as Pelosi: to win a Democratic House majority. And while the money is not legally considered a donation to McCready, it unquestionably helps him. Through its founder, the PAC has ties to the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, or DCCC, the official campaign arm of House Democrats -- and Pelosi is the House Democrats’ elected leader. Also: The DCCC supports McCready. While it would likely support any Democrat who has a chance of winning, McCready was among the first candidates on the DCCC’s "Red to Blue" list, which "arms top-tier candidates with organizational and fundraising support," the DCCC said when announcing this. Pelosi chose Rep. Ray Ray Lujan, of New Mexico, to chair the DCCC, although fellow Democrats had to affirm her choice. That puts him in the "Pelosi crowd," the NRCC said. Lujan has his own leadership PAC, Turquoise PAC, and the PAC along with Lujan’s own reelection campaign committee have given McCready $5,000. Rep. Steny Hoyer of Maryland is the House Democratic whip, a key member of the Pelosi leadership team. He has given McCready’s campaign $14,000 through his own leadership PAC and his campaign committee. Rep. James Clyburn of South Carolina is assistant Democratic leader. His leadership PAC gave McCready $5,000. The PAC affiliated with Rep. Linda Sanchez of California, the Democratic caucus vice chair, donated $2,000.. McCready "has the blessing of party leaders — he is their candidate," Kerry Rom from the NRCC told us. "Support from Pelosi-linked organizations and her leadership team tells us where he ultimately stands on the issues." The smudges Is there a straight line from financial support for a candidate and the people — say, Pelosi — he’ll support? Steven Greene, a political science professor at North Carolina State University, said it’s more like a set of "big, gray smudges." "It would be folly to say that Nancy Pelosi has nothing to do" with decisions on where to put House leadership or allied resources, Greene said. "But it doesn’t suppose any loyalty to Pelosi" on McCready’s part, since McCready has made clear he wants a different Democratic House leader. McCready in November criticized Pelosi in a Charlotte Observer column, saying Pelosi "used moves from the Bill Clinton-era playbook" when initially defending Rep. John Conyers against charges of sexual assault. McCready told the Washington Post and others that Democrats need "new blood." His campaign told PolitiFact that if elected, McCready will not vote for Pelosi as leader. And he has received campaign donations from others who want Pelosi out. For example, the NRCC, in an email to us, listed Rep. Joe Crowley of New York, chairman of the House Democratic Caucus, as part of Team Pelosi. Crowley’s leadership PAC donated $5,000 to McCready. But Crowley — who lost his recent primary election and won’t be in Congress next year — had said he would oppose Pelosi’s return to leadership. The tax cuts Harris uses the "Pelosi crowd" label to say that McCready wants to "grow government and repeal your tax cut." Yet there is no evidence of that. McCready has only said he wants to make sure the tax cuts for individuals and families stay in place after their scheduled 2025 expiration. "Dan will fight for middle-class tax cuts and policies to level the playing field for hardworking North Carolinians," his campaign website says. It is impossible to know what other policies "to level the field" might face a House vote, although some liberal Democrats have suggested raising corporate income tax rates closer to their pre-cut levels. This takes us into supposition for issue after issue: What would McCready do? That is actually the subtext of the Harris ad. McCready is a Democrat. He's "with" the Pelosi crowd. But there are degrees of beliefs and votes within the Democratic Party. To simplify in the spirit of the ad: There are California Democrats, and there are Southern Democrats. They are not all the same. Our ruling Are there ties between members of Team Pelosi and McCready? Absolutely. Does McCready support the same agenda as Democratic leaders such as Pelosi? Based on his website, he supports much of it, but it is the agenda of Democrats in general. He opposes turning Medicare into a voucher program. (House Republicans have proposed a program they say would be entirely voluntary.) He wants to protect the EPA from "a hatchet." He supports abortion rights. Such agreement, however, would make the overwhelming majority of Democrats "in with" Pelosi. It would mean the southern "blue dog" Democrats are. It would mean the East and West Coast Democrats are -- even those who want to replace her because they say she hasn't been foreceful or confrontational enough. There would be few distinctions When Republicans invoke Pelosi’s name and say an opponent is "with them," they are using "shorthand for ‘Oh, those liberals,’" Greene said. Harris’ claim has elements of truth. But it affixes a generic label that needs fuller context. We can’t say which shade of blue will come out of the wash, but we can rate the claim: Half True.

pomt-03607	"In 2010, everybody said you can't dare let guns go into the national parks, and of course the rapes, murders, robberies and assaults are down about 85 percent since we did that."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2013/may/09/tom-coburn/tom-coburn-says-after-national-park-gun-ban-lifted/	During an interview on the MSNBC show Morning Joe, Sen. Tom Coburn, R-Okla., argued for legislation he’s proposing that would allow guns to be carried into lands controlled by the Army Corps of Engineers. To make the case that guns make places safer, Coburn cited a dramatic before-and-after statistic that stems from the lifting of a ban on guns in national parks. Coburn was a leader in the effort to get Congress to approve the change. President Barack Obama signed the national park provision into law, and it took effect in February 2010. "In 2010," Coburn said on Morning Joe, "everybody said you can't dare let guns go into the national parks, and of course the rapes, murders, robberies and assaults are down about 85 percent since we did that." That’s a pretty stunning drop. Is it accurate? When we checked with Coburn’s office, John Hart, a spokesman, acknowledged that his senator had misspoken in a way that overstated the decline. Hart said Coburn’s office had compared FBI crime data on National Park Service land from 2008 to 2011, the most recent year available. By the office’s calculations, the number of violent incidents actually dropped by 12 percent, not 85 percent. "The numbers show crime rates have declined, but he misspoke when he mentioned 85 percent," Hart said. "On balance, the facts support our conclusion that crime rates would go down under our policy, not the conclusion of the amendment’s critics who said that allowing guns in national parks would lead to more crime." However, before we bless Coburn’s revised analysis, let’s look at the original data. Here’s a summary chart for violent crimes in the national parks between 2008 and 2011. Year Murder and non-negligent manslaughter Forcible rape Robbery Aggravated assault Total violent crimes 2008 5 37 66 259 367 2009 3 34 64 206 307 2010 15 45 58 251 369 2011 7 34 58 224 323 Change, 2008-11 +40% -8% -12% -14% -12% Change, 2009-11 +133% 0 -9% +9% +5% A few issues jump out to us. First, murders actually went up between 2008 and 2011, contrary to what Coburn said. More importantly, using 2008 as the "before" year in this before-and-after comparison amounts to cherry picking. As we noted, the law went into effect in 2010, so the most obvious way to frame the comparison would be to use the data from 2009 (the last full year before the gun ban was lifted) and 2011 (the most recent year). And as it turns out, the comparison to 2009 is not nearly as favorable to Coburn’s overall point. Between 2009 and 2011, these four categories of violent crimes actually rose collectively by 5 percent. Robberies did decline by 9 percent, but murders more than doubled (from a very small base), the number of rapes was stable and the tally of aggravated assaults -- by far the most common of these four crimes -- rose by 9 percent. Meanwhile, it’s also worth noting that the number of crimes in national parks is generally pretty small, which makes it unclear how much stock anyone should place in year-to-year percentage increases and decreases. Finally, we’ll point out that Coburn’s stated decline may -- or may not -- have been caused by the deterrence of having guns around. But if they were a cause for the decline from 2008 to 2011, what’s to stop someone from arguing that they were the cause of the increase from 2009 to 2011? The numbers alone simply don’t tell us. Our ruling On Morning Joe, Coburn said, "In 2010, everybody said you can't dare let guns go into the national parks, and of course the rapes, murders, robberies and assaults are down about 85 percent since we did that." Coburn’s office acknowledges that he misspoke; they actually calculated a decline of 12 percent, which is dramatically lower than 85 percent. But we find even the revised statistic to be questionable. It hinges on using 2008 data, when 2009 data would be more appropriate -- and a comparison using data from 2009 actually shows an increase in violent crime in national parks since the gun ban was lifted. Meanwhile, it’s far from clear that guns had an influence on the relatively small number of crimes that take place in national parks. We rate Coburn’s statement False.

pomt-14582	"The American people will not support doing anything about people that are in this country illegally until the law is enforced first."	mostly false	/florida/statements/2016/feb/06/marco-rubio/marco-rubio-change-legal-status-illegal-immigrants/	Marco Rubio was grilled about his 2013 immigration bill during the ABC debate in New Hampshire, specifically about why he abandoned his own legislation. Debate moderator David Muir asked Rubio, "Gov. (Chris) Christie has said of you, as soon as you felt the heat, you turned tail and run. Gov. (Jeb) Bush has said, ‘I don't think we need people cutting and running anymore.’ Did you fight for your own legislation, senator, or did you run from it?" Rubio replied: "We can’t get that legislation passed. The American people will not support doing anything about people that are in this country illegally until the law is enforced first, and you prove it to them." Is that how the majority of Americans feel about changing immigration laws? Based on our previous fact-checks, we suspected public polling contradicted that position. We could not reach a Rubio spokesperson on debate night. Polls about path to legal status Rubio was a cosponsor of a bill that included a path to citizenship for illegal immigrants. It included significant hurdles, including fines and a waiting period. The bill passed the Senate in 2013 but stalled in the House after leadership refused to bring it up for a vote. Since then, Rubio has called for a piecemeal approach that emphasizes border security first. Recent polls have asked people if they support a path to legal status for undocumented immigrants. That would allow them to work and pay taxes, but they would not be able to vote, for example, which would require citizenship. A May 2015 poll found broad public support for path to legal status, according to a report from the Pew Research Center. The poll found that 72 percent of Americans said that undocumented immigrants currently living in the United States should be allowed to stay in the country legally, if certain requirements are met. The poll found that 42 percent said they should be able to apply for citizenship while 26 percent said they should only be able to apply for permanent residency. Pew’s survey found that 56 percent of Republicans favored a path to legal status. However, George Hawley, a political scientist at the University of Alabama, previously told PunditFact that the Pew survey also shows a complicated set of attitudes. "A majority of Republicans also felt that giving people who came to the United States illegally a way to gain legal status is like rewarding them for doing something wrong," Hawley said. "Further, 42 percent of Republicans felt legal immigration should be decreased, compared to 21 percent who think it should be increased. Also, far more Republicans view immigrants as a burden, 63 percent, than view them as an asset for the country, 27 percent." Other 2015 polls also showed broad support for giving illegal immigrants a path to legal status. A Pew survey done in September 2015 found that "majorities across all demographic and partisan groups favor providing legal status to undocumented immigrants. Republicans (66 percent) continue to be less likely than independents (74 percent) or Democrats (80 percent) to support a path to legal status for those in the U.S. illegally." A Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll conducted in July found a majority of adults showed support for some sort of legal status. The poll found that 47 percent of all adults supported a pathway to citizenship while 17 percent supported the right to a legal status, adding up to a total of 64 percent. The majority of Republicans too supported some sort of legal status. Among Republicans, the poll found 36 percent support a pathway that eventually allows citizenship while 17 percent favored legal status, for a total of 53 percent. Gallup found in July 2015 that 65 percent favored a path to citizenship in a poll conducted in July 2015. But this poll included larger samples of blacks and Hispanics -- Hispanics are more likely than other groups to favor a path to citizenship. Gallup found big differences between the two major parties. At 80 percent, Democrats overwhelmingly favored a path to citizenship while that dropped to 50 percent for Republicans. So currently, majorities support allowing people here illegally to change their status in some way that allows them to stay. Polls conducted at the time the bill was being debated also showed public support, though. An ABC News/Washington Post poll in May 2013 -- a month before the Senate passed the bill -- asked, "Would you support or oppose a program giving undocumented immigrants now living in the United States the right to live here legally if they pay a fine and meet other requirements?" About 58 percent chose "support." When a path to legal status was specifically connected with border security, support hit 50 percent. But 44 percent said they should not be linked. An ABC News/Washington Post poll in April 2013 asked, "Do you think a law allowing people to apply for citizenship should take effect only after border control has been improved, or should take effect without being linked to border control efforts?" Fifty percent chose "after being improved," while 44 percent said "without being linked" while the remainder were unsure. One expert told us it’s not so much that the general public opposes immigration legislation, but that House members in competitive districts fear losing primary races. "Some polls ask about other immigration policies, like building a wall, using e-verify, etc. which are generally favored, but polls have shown for a while now that there is broad support for some pathway to legalization or citizenship," said Stephen A. Nuño, a professor of politics and international affairs at Northern Arizona University. "The problem is that high concentrations of Republicans in those Republican House members’ districts are feared and are closely watched by potential challengers. There is the other thing that many Republican leaders simply don't want a pathway to legalization regardless of what the country wants." Our ruling Rubio said, "The American people will not support doing anything about people that are in this country illegally until the law is enforced first." Multiple polls have showed that the majority of Americans support some type of status to allow illegal immigrants to remain in the United States -- and some extend that to citizenship. We found one poll that suggested people would like to see border enforcement first, but there are many polls that show straightforward support for legal status. We rate this claim Mostly False. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/9632eb5c-a709-4c91-a182-1376ae3ecab0	None	Marco Rubio	None	None	None	2016-02-06T23:33:25	2016-02-06	['United_States']
pomt-14970	Says CNN deleted an online poll showing Bernie Sanders won the first Democratic presidential debate to help out Hillary Clinton.	pants on fire!	/punditfact/statements/2015/oct/19/nowthis/no-internet-cnn-did-not-delete-its-poll-showing-be/	A conspiracy theory rattled the Bernieverse soon after many media outlets, including CNN, pronounced Hillary Clinton the winner of the first Democratic presidential debate. Some of Sen. Bernie Sanders’ supporters said no, Sanders was the clear winner, evidenced by a CNN poll that showed most people thought Sanders was best. The problem: CNN deleted the poll. The theory: CNN deleted the poll to so as not to counter its narrative that Clinton won. A video by NowThis, which shares GIFs and video stories by social media, picked up on a Reddit theory and promoted this video on Twitter and Facebook, teasing, "It looks like CNN is trying to help Hillary look good, even if that means deleting polls." Here’s part of the script that was seen by millions: "The Internet thinks Bernie Sanders totally won the debate. But CNN thinks Hillary won. Even though CNN’s own polls say Bernie won by 68 percent. But that doesn’t concern them. They allegedly just deleted the polls." The video suggests CNN "deleted the polls" showing Sanders won because CNN’s parent company, Time Warner, is "one of Hillary’s biggest donors," spending more on her campaign than "Bernie’s top 15 donors gave him." This is just one example of a viral claim. For now, we will skip the part about the conspiracy that focuses on Time Warner’s campaign donations, because there’s a fundamental flaw with these posts. CNN didn’t delete its poll. The poll showing Sanders way ahead is here on Facebook through CNN.com/vote. It’s not on CNN’s website, but it’s not clear that it ever was on CNN’s website. The original link does not appear to be working on some mobile devices. Try this link if you are having problems with the links above. It should take you to a log-in screen and then show the poll, which has closed. CNN’s digital team used a Facebook app to run live polls of users about what they thought of the debate as it was happening. CNN anchor Don Lemon reported on the strong show of support for Sanders from CNN’s Facebook Lounge on debate night. Lemon mentioned how Facebook users thought Sanders excelled on foreign policy, economic issues and overall debate performance. So not only did CNN not delete the poll, but the news channel also did not hide it. It might be obvious, but these are clearly non-scientific polls. NowThis attempted to correct its report on Facebook by posting this update on the video’s comment stream: "Clarification: This was an unofficial social media user poll, and CNN says it's still live on their web site and Facebook page." But again, you don't have to take CNN's word for it that the post wasn't deleted, and NowThis can't hide behind the use of the word allegedly. The poll is here for anyone to see. Here's a screengrab we took Oct. 19: Our ruling Sanders supporters are free to disagree with analysis by journalists and pundits of who won the Democratic debate. What isn’t up for debate, however, is the fact that CNN did not delete its poll of Facebook users, who overwhelmingly said Sanders won the debate. It’s still on a Facebook page managed by CNN.

pomt-01231	"The Kochs stand to make around $100 billion if the government approves the Keystone XL pipeline."	pants on fire!	/punditfact/statements/2014/nov/19/thom-hartmann/does-keystone-xl-promise-100-billion-profit-koch-b/	Opponents of the Keystone XL pipeline are stoking fear about the project by connecting it to two of the biggest bogeymen in politics: Charles and David Koch. The claim goes that the Koch brothers stand to make $100 billion if the pipeline gets built. The figure, which would effectively double the Kochs’ net worth, has bounced around liberal news organizations and was repeated this month by progressive radio talk show and TV host Thom Hartmann on his RT show. Take it with a block of salt, a PunditFact analysis finds. The $100 billion estimate is far from a neutral analyst’s prediction, based instead on the far-out calculations of a group that wants the pipeline, and the Koch brothers, to fail. Here’s what you need to know. Keystone and Kochs in context First, let’s put $100 billion in perspective. That’s an enormous sum, half as much as Facebook’s value, about the same as the Dominican Republic’s GDP and approximately equal to the Kochs’ combined, reported net worth. If the brothers had a sure windfall on their hands, you might think they would be actively promoting the pipeline, or at least be positioned to pounce by reserving space in it or actively drilling in the area. (Map via TransCanada.) But the Kochs have repeatedly told reporters and Democratic lawmakers that the company has no involvement in the pipeline and is not a proposed customer. For the record, "we are supportive of it," Koch Industries spokesman Rob Tappan told PunditFact. Pipeline builder TransCanada has also tried swatting down Koch connections, saying Koch Industries has "absolutely nothing" to do with the pipeline. Koch Industries is, however, a major player in the Canadian oil market. The Washington Post identified the company in April 2014 as the largest foreign leaseholder of acres of Canadian oil sands. An Alberta Energy spokesman told us the agency could not confirm the Post’s analysis of Koch-leased lands -- estimated to be between 1.12 million to 1.47 million acres -- because "organizations like Koch can change and occasionally restructure." Even so, the considerable amount of land leased by the Kochs does not automatically signal that the Kochs will get a sure $100 billion payout, or any payout. Many of the Koch land-leases, the Post reported, came before Keystone was ever proposed, the company has not reserved space in the pipeline as is typical, and the pipeline route would not run near Koch-owned refineries. How you get $100 billion The origin of the Keystone = $100 billion for the Kochs line stems from a 2013 report from the International Forum on Globalization. While that group may sound neutral, it in fact opposes "free market" institutions such as the World Trade Organization, International Monetary Fund and North American Free Trade Agreement. The group also makes no secret of its opposition to the pipeline and Koch Industries. It produced an October 2013 report, "The Billionaires’ Carbon Bomb: Koch brothers and Keystone XL." Experts we consulted were struck by the report’s bias, with chapters devoted to victims of "Koch greed" and the Kochs’ vast web of nonprofit spending for political aims, as well as its calculation that the Keystone XL pipeline carries "$100 billion in potential profits" for the Kochs. Experts in energy, economics and business called the methodology behind the figure "absurd" and "puzzling." In PunditFact terminology, that would be Pants on Fire. In an email, International Forum on Globalization executive director Victor Menotti (notable for his arrest during anti-WTO protests in 1999) said his group kept the methodology "simple to give people a credible idea of what Koch has at stake with Keystone." The group came up with two different numbers -- experts didn’t vouch for either -- and multiplied them together to come up with Kochs' potential profits. The group assumed that the land leased by Koch would contain 15 billion barrels of "profitable-to-produce" Canadian tar sands oil, a guesstimate extrapolated from one documented 2006 sale of a 374,000-acre parcel with 47 billion barrels of oil mixture (more details on page 8 of the IFG report). The group assumed a $15 gross production per barrel due to Keystone XL. Multiply one by the other and you get $90 billion. Round it up by $10 billion and you get headlines. Counting the ways We consulted four experts in energy economics and the petroleum industry to review the forum’s report and offer their analysis. They pointed out 10 significant flaws. 1. Price of oil is down: When the report was released, oil prices were about $100 a barrel. They’ve since fallen to about $75 a barrel, a drop that cuts into the report’s estimated profit of $15 per barrel. Menotti acknowledges this and said his group is working on an update that accounts for the drop in the price of oil since the summer. 2. Not realistic: The amount of oil the group says the Kochs will pump through the pipeline (15-16 billion barrels) is "enough to fill Keystone XL to capacity for about 80 years if you assume that all the oil is shipped as diluted bitumen," said Andrew Leach, a professor of energy policy at the University of Alberta School of Business. 3. Unlikely payoff: Leach said a better measure to understand the potential return for the Kochs is by looking at current lease sale prices. In Alberta, oil leases are running about $70 an acre. Multiply that by 2 million acres -- the high end of what the Kochs may have -- and you get $140 million. "It’s pretty hard to believe that a pipeline would increase the value of an oil sands lease by three orders of magnitude," Leach said. 4. Development takes time: According to the Vancouver Observer, Koch has filed a development permit for one site, "but the time to develop all 2 million acres would be very long," Leach said. The weather and infrastructure costs present more of a challenge to produce in Alberta. 5. Keystone creates more competition: The pipeline would introduce more competition into refineries that have been bottlenecked with too much oil from Bakken and Midwestern crude at Cushing, Okla., pipelines, the experts said. If the pipeline is built, more Canadian oil sands could enter the market at Gulf Coast refineries to compete with oil brought in from the Middle East and Venezuela. "Competition doesn’t usually lead to increased prices," said Anastasia Shcherbakova, a University of Texas Dallas clinical assistant professor in energy economics and energy finance. 6. Does not factor in taxes: The report does not factor in taxes or royalties that need to be paid to the Canadian government, another factor that eats into the assumption of $15 profit per barrel, said Detlef Hallermann, a Texas A&M University associate clinical finance professor who earned his doctoral degree in mineral economics. 7. Lack of discount rate: The usable oil substance will not be plied from below the surface all at once. Oil-sands mining is a long-term, high-cost investment, and the report does not go into how long the estimated 6 billion barrels would take to produce. Revenues generated over time should be calculated in present value, not nominal terms, to reflect how much it costs to bring the project online and maintain it, Shcherbakova said. "My understanding of the analysis ... is they’re counting all $100 billion as if it’s all coming to you today," Hallermann said. 8. The Kochs don’t own the land: The Kochs are not the owners of these acres, they own the rights to explore the parcels themselves. Leases are held for a term, not for forever, said Terry McInturff, chairman of Texas Tech University’s area of energy, economics and law. 9. Every acreage is not equal: The report assumes the geology of the leased land is uniform and will yield uniform amounts of oil. But that is not how it works in Alberta’s boreal forests. "That would be too easy," Shcherbakova said. 10. Assumes no Keystone, no oil: Experts also noted that the report mistakenly assumes that other methods to transport crude oil sands would not happen if the pipeline is rejected. Our ruling The claim here is that the Koch brothers will turn a $100 billion profit if the Keystone XL pipeline is constructed, essentially doubling their net worth. As we’ve shown, the Kochs hold oil leases in Canada. We're not ruling out that they could benefit in some ways from the Keystone XL pipeline. But trying to extrapolate their oil-sands leases into a specific profit figure is sheer folly. The authors of the report that tried to do so made so many assumptions and mistakes that experts deemed their analysis "absurd." We rate it Pants on Fire!

pomt-08417	Says Republican Reid Ribble says stimulus bill failed to jumpstart the economy, but his "roofing company made almost $300,000 off stimulus funded projects."	half-true	/wisconsin/statements/2010/oct/20/democratic-congressional-campaign-committee/democratic-group-says-republican-us-house-candidat/	If you can’t trust a candidate’s own official campaign biography, just what can you trust? That’s a question that popped up as we tried to determine the accuracy of a television ad from the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee attacking Reid Ribble, the Republican challenging two-term U.S. Rep. Steve Kagen (D-Appleton). No, Ribble is not one of those wannabes who claimed he was a decorated war hero when the closest he came to action was watching a Rambo movie. This is more mundane -- until recently, Ribble’s bio posted on his own campaign website said he owned a roofing company. That ownership claim helped give the DCCC -- whose aim is to win or hold seats for Democrats -- an opening to air an attack ad portraying Ribble as a hypocrite on stimulus money. The 8th Congressional District, which includes Green Bay and the Fox Valley, has long been considered a swing seat. Both sides have targeted it this year. And with jobs on the mind of voters, it’s little surprise Democrats would tag Ribble as looking out for himself instead of others. The ad starts with newsreel-style black and white footage, with an announcer loudly proclaiming, "Extra! Extra! Read all about it! Politician says one thing, does another!" It goes on to say Ribble has criticized the stimulus plan, which Kagen supported, saying it failed to "jumpstart" the economy, but his "roofing company made almost $300,000 off stimulus funded projects." That was just the first of the finger pointing: The Ribble campaign responded by calling the Democrats liars, saying the candidate sold the family business in December 2009 and, besides, the jobs in question weren’t worth anywhere near $300,000. Charges of lies and hypocrisy. That’s our cue. Let’s try to sort this all out. It should be an easy job -- either Ribble’s roofing company got the contracts or it didn’t; either he owned it at the time or it had been sold. But, as reporters and roofers know, looks can be deceiving. Sometimes you just have to look under a couple of shingles to see what’s what. For its backup, spokeswoman Gabby Adler said the DCCC found references to Reid Ribble owning the company on his campaign website and the roofing company’s website. Though not mentioned in the ad, the Democrats are citing a contract awarded by the Kaukauna School District to Security Roofing -- a division of The Ribble Group -- to renovate the roof of Haen Elementary School. The contract was awarded in October 2009, but the work was done in 2010. Let’s start with the ownership question. Brandon Moody, Ribble campaign manager, said The Ribble Group was sold to Ribble’s nephew, Troy Ribble, in December 2009. Ribble, Moody said, had no ownership stake when the project was done and the company was paid. "It’s a timeline issue and it’s a lie," Moody said. Then we peeked under the shingle. We found it’s the Ribble campaign that has a timeline problem. The roofing job was awarded by the school district in October 2009, said Robert Schafer, district financial officer for the Kaukauna schools. That’s before the company was sold. Not only that, Schafer said, when the bids were sought, Reid Ribble was the contact person for the company. Troy Ribble, confirmed his uncle handled the bid for the project. In our search, we came across paperwork filed with the Virginia State Corporation Commission in February 2010 that lists Reid Ribble as chairman of the company. They had done some work in Virginia earlier this year. What gives? "He is the chairman of the board of directors," Troy Ribble told PolitiFact Wisconsin. Troy said his uncle, however, does not own stock in the 52-year-old company and is not involved as an executive in day-to-day operations. Reid Ribble remains a consultant, Troy said. The acquisition makes him the third generation of Ribbles to own the firm. What’s more, on Oct. 13, 2010 -- some 10 months after Ribble said he sold the company -- we found his campaign website read: "Reid owns and operates one of the most successful roof construction and consulting companies in the United States." Ribble’s Facebook page is even clearer: It lists him as the president of the Ribble Group Inc. Even the company site still listed him as president until at least early October. Like the campaign site, that website has since been changed. For his part, Moody referred to the out-of-date campaign website as "minutia." But for a first-time candidate, one promising to bring his business acumen to Washington, that life story -- and how it’s presented to the public -- strikes us as important. Meanwhile, we asked repeatedly for documentation that the firm had been sold, but the campaign did not provide it. The campaign sent us a copy of a June 14, 2010, letter from attorney Roy Fine to Troy Ribble that refers to the sale of the company. The letter asks Troy to sign "Resolutions by you as the sole remaining shareholder dated effective Dec. 10," as well as forms for the redemption of Reid Ribble’s stock and his employment agreement. So, regardless of whether the company was sold, Reid Ribble still has strong ties to the company. He is chairman, receives a monthly consulting fee and was active when the company bid on the school district work. Now let’s look into the $300,000 figure the Democrats use as the price tag. To back up the claim, Adler produced a letter from the school district to the state Department of Public Instruction outlining $1 million worth of projects that it hoped to finance with the no-interest bonds issued as a result of the stimulus. The list included $700,000 worth of roofing projects. But asking is different than receiving. Only $500,000 worth of bonding authority was granted, said Natalie Rew, auditor for the state Department of Public Instruction. Of that, only about $133,000 was paid to The Ribble Group, Schafer said, noting the remainder went to other projects. (The Ribble Group has done other large projects for the district, work not funded with stimulus dollars.) That’s a long way from making "almost $300,000 off stimulus funded projects." That’s laying the shingles on a little thick. So, what do we know? Ribble says he sold his company in December 2009, but has not shown us a definitive document to prove it, instead offering a "trust me" response. That’s hard to do when the campaign’s own website, which the Democrats relied on in making their claim, until recently, touted Ribble’s ownership. Besides, Ribble remains involved as chairman. As for the project itself, the school district said the job was awarded while Reid Ribble was in charge, even if the work was done later. But the $300,000 figure the Democrats cite is also off, way off -- the actual amount received was about $133,000. With the sloppiness on both sides, here’s the cleanest we can call it: Half True.

pomt-10987	"$1.8 billion Of Soros’ money just intercepted – he could officially go to prison for years"	pants on fire!	/truth-o-meter/statements/2018/jul/13/blog-posting/soros-not-headed-jail/	Billionaire George Soros has made his final donation, according to some conservative bloggers. A May article in Right Wing News says that nearly $2 billion of his money was "intercepted" and that the investor could go to jail for years. This article, which has been shared over 5,000 times on Facebook, is not true. This story was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) Soros is a hedge fund manager and philanthropist. He has donated $18 billion to his philanthropic organization, Open Society Foundations, for initiatives to support universities, promote democracy, and reduce poverty. He also regularly donates to Democratic campaigns in the United States. Lately, Soros has focused on changing the justice system by donating to local district attorney candidates who pledge to act tougher on police brutality cases and be more aware of racial issues in policing. The Right Wing News post frames this as the grounds for Soros’s arrest. But who intercepted the money? What was the crime? We decided to investigate. Anticlimactic Clickbait The headline of this article, which states that the money was intercepted and that Soros could be headed to jail, is widely unsupported by evidence. It is also unsupported by the article itself, which never explains or even mentions legal action being brought against Soros. Instead, the article on Right Wing News focuses on Soros’s involvement in district attorney elections in California. The author cites entire paragraphs from Fox News and the Los Angeles Times, two outlets that have reported on Soros’s election donations. Neither mention any legal action, and a Nexis search did not find any other articles about about arresting Soros. This part of the headline appears to be entirely false, and merely meant to entice readers to click. It is true that Soros and other liberal groups have donated huge sums of money to candidates who want to crack down on police brutality. However, a Los Angeles Times graphic shows that Soros donated about $19 million to 21 prosecutor campaigns across the country since 2014. In California, he has spent $2.7 million. This is a far cry from $1.8 billion spent on four campaigns in California, as Right Wing News claimed. The headline’s claim that this money was intercepted by someone was also unsupported by the body of the post and any other sources. Our ruling Right Wing News repurposed existing news articles about district attorney elections in California to make it appear that George Soros had donated 100 times more money than he had. The website then headlined this article with two baseless claims: that Soros’s donations had been intercepted, and that he was likely to go to prison. Soros is not in legal trouble for his donations to district attorney campaigns, has only donated $2.7 million in California, and none of his money was intercepted by a third party. Due to a completely fabricated headline and incorrect numbers, we rate this claim Pants on Fire! UPDATE (July 16, 2018): After we published our fact-check, Right Wing News contacted us to say that the story was an opinion piece and that the headline included an error. Right Wing News adjusted the headline to say, "OPINION: $1.8 Million Of Soros’ Money Just Intercepted – He Should Officially Go To Prison For Years."

pomt-11843	Chicago is "the city with the strongest gun laws in our nation."	pants on fire!	/truth-o-meter/statements/2017/nov/07/donald-trump/trump-wrongly-repeats-chicago-has-strongest-gun-la/	President Donald Trump might be in Asia, but violence on the homefront followed him to South Korea. In a joint press conference with South Korean President Moon Jae-in, a reporter asked Trump if he would consider extreme vetting for people trying to buy a gun in the wake of the mass shooting at a Texas church. Trump said a longer waiting period would have made no difference and then drew on a familiar talking point. "You look at the city with the strongest gun laws in our nation, is Chicago, and Chicago is a disaster," Trump said. Trump used this line during the presidential campaign, with particular emphasis on Chicago’s high murder rate. Our partners at PolitiFact Illinois said he had a point about the murders, but his description of the Windy City having the toughest gun laws was way off the mark. Since then, the administration has taken the line even further into inaccurate territory. Here’s why. There are two ways to measure the toughness of gun laws. You can look at the rules controlling gun ownership and the penalties for misuse of a weapon. From 1982 to 2010, Chicago prohibited people from keeping handguns in their homes. When Washington, D.C., saw a similar ban overturned, Chicago did have the toughest gun law in the country. That lasted about two years. The U.S. Supreme Court overturned the Chicago ordinance in 2010. The plaintiffs in the case of McDonald vs. City of Chicago argued that the ban left them vulnerable to criminals, and the court agreed. The court said that the Second and 14th Amendments protected the right to bear arms and that neither Chicago nor Illinois could interfere with that. At one time, the state of Illinois prevented gun owners from carrying a concealed weapon. That ended in 2013 when the state became the last in the country to allow the practice. To get a gun in Chicago, you must take a firearms training class and get a Chicago firearms permit. The course costs between $100 and $150 and the permit costs $100. You would also need a state firearms owner identification card, which can take as many as 50 days for processing. It’s harder and requires more time to do the same in New York. It takes about three to six months to get a permit and costs over $400. And unlike Chicago, New York runs its own concealed carry permit process, as does Los Angeles. Chicago also isn't particularly tough when it comes to enforcement. A 2014 Chicago Sun Times analysis found that Chicago judges tended to hand down the minimum sentence of one year for illegal gun possession while the maximum is three years. Felons with a weapon got four-year sentences on average while they could have received 10. On the state level, the Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence, a pro-gun control group, gives many states higher rankings for restricting gun ownership and use. A total of seven states, including New York, Massachusetts, Connecticut, New Jersey, Maryland, California and Hawaii, have rules that go beyond what Illinois has. The group said Illinois could bring up its score if it allowed local governments to pass gun laws, required guns be stored safely at home and gave local law enforcement more leeway to deny conceal carry permits. The one area where Chicago is trying to reduce access to weapons is by not allowing gun stores or firing ranges to open within the city limits. So far, courts have ruled against Chicago. We reached out to the White House and did not hear back. Our ruling Trump said Chicago has the strongest gun laws in the nation. The statement is years out of date. After a Supreme Court ruling, Chicago residents can own handguns and carry them unseen on the streets. A national gun control group puts seven states above Illinois in regulating gun ownership. Trump needs to refresh this talking point. We rate this claim Pants on Fire. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com	None	Donald Trump	None	None	None	2017-11-07T14:53:36	2017-11-07	['None']
pomt-14152	Says Donald Trump’s "only economic agenda is imposing massive taxes on the American people with a 40 percent tax hike of a giant tariff."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/may/01/ted-cruz/donald-trumps-economic-agenda-imposing-massive-tax/	Sen. Ted Cruz, looking to gain momentum against GOP presidential frontrunner Donald Trump ahead of the Indiana primary, contended that Trump’s economic policies would hurt Hoosiers and Americans across the country. Cruz said on NBC’s Meet the Press that his top priority is to bring manufacturing jobs back to Indiana, and he has a "real policy agenda" to do it, unlike Trump. "Donald’s only economic agenda is imposing massive taxes on the American people with a 40 percent tax hike of a giant tariff," Cruz said. "That would send us into a recession. It would drive jobs overseas. It would kill small businesses." Is Cruz right that the only idea up Trump’s sleeve is a giant tax on imports? Trump has certainly floated the idea of imposing tariffs on goods made overseas, but it’s not the only item on his economic agenda. And though it’s not entirely clear whether the tariffs would amount to 40 percent tax hike, experts agree that the costs would be passed onto U.S. consumers and businesses. Let’s begin with what Trump has proposed. Trump’s plan to correct ‘stupid trade’ First, Trump has outlined a few other economic proposals beyond tariffs like declaring China a currency manipulator, upholding intellectual property law, ending China’s export subsidies (more on this later) and lowering the corporate tax rate to incentivize American companies to stay at home. He’s also suggested renegotiating or pulling out the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) and stopping the Trans-Pacific Partnership. But Cruz has a point that Trump has talked at length about imposing tariffs on imported goods as a remedy for trade imbalances and lost American jobs. He’s specified a 35 percent tariff on some goods coming from Mexico and 45 percent tax on all Chinese products, which he said in the last Republican debate is a "threat" that he’d only enact it if "they don’t follow the rules." Here are some of the comments Trump has made regarding tariffs: • Candidacy announcement speech, June 16, 2015: Trump said he’ll tax China "until they behave properly" and charge a 35 percent tax on "every truck and every part manufactured in (the Ford plant in Mexico) that comes across the border." • Interview with the New York Times editorial board, Jan. 7, 2016: "I would tax China coming in, products coming in. I would do a tariff. And they do it to us. ... I would do a tax. And let me tell you what the tax should be. The tax should be 45 percent. That would be a tax that would be an equivalent to some of the kind of devaluations that they’ve done. They cannot believe that we haven’t done this yet." • GOP primary debate in South Carolina, Feb. 13, 2016: Trump said he’ll tell Carrier, the American air conditioner company that announced a move to Mexico, "we're going to tax you when those air conditioners come. So stay where you are or build in the United States because we are killing ourselves with trade pacts that are no good for us and no good for our workers." • GOP primary debate in Miami, March 10, 2016: "If you don't tax certain products coming into this country from certain countries that are taking advantage of the United States and laughing at our stupidity, we're going to continue to lose businesses and we're going to continue to lose jobs. ...The 45 percent is a threat that if they (China) don't behave, if they don't follow the rules and regulations so that we can have it equal on both sides, we will tax you. It doesn't have to be 45, it could be less." Making Americans pay for the haul Trump’s tariff proposals have been called "uneducated," "worrisome" and "entirely ridiculous," and many economists (though not all) say they would hurt Americans. However, Cruz may be overstating the impact. "The biggest losers would be U.S. consumers and companies," said Scott Lincicome, an international trade law and policy expert at the libertarian Cato Institute. Tariffs at the level Trump is suggesting would cause prices of cheap products like air conditioners and intermediate goods like auto parts to soar and could cost U.S. jobs. But as some of the costs would be absorbed by Chinese and Mexican exporters, a 40 percent tariff doesn’t translate directly into a 40 percent tax hike. "You would have to do some analysis to determine how much of a tax hike it is, but it is probably significantly less than 40 percent," said Joel Trachtman, a trade law specialist at the University of Maryland. Trachtman noted, however, that the sum of all Trump’s trade proposals — including the rejection of free trade agreements — may get you to a 40 percent hike. Trump’s tariffs would also see push back from the World Trade Organization, Lincicome pointed out, as Mexico City and Beijing wouldn’t take them lying down. "The WTO sanctions these types of duties targeting export markets with the stroke of a pen. That’s just insane," he said. "It’s a blatant violation of WTO rules. He would get us involved with a bunch of litigation and retaliation." For example, the 35 percent tariff the United States imposed on Chinese tires in 2009 cost American consumers $1.1 billion in 2011 and the U.S. chicken industry $1 billion, according to analysis by the nonpartisan Peterson Institute for International Economics. The price of Chinese-made car tires rose by 26 percent, so the United States imported from countries like Thailand, Indonesia and Mexico instead and paid a premium for the shift. China also retaliated by slapping a tariff on American poultry, reducing chicken exports by 90 percent. Looking ahead, Trump’s suggested tariffs for Mexican imports would significantly affect the U.S. auto industry and would-be American car buyers. For example, the base price of a Chrysler Ram pick-up truck, which is currently assembled in Mexico, would increase by $9,000, according to Reuters. And like China, Mexico could return the favor by taxing U.S. goods as they’ve done in the past. Our ruling Cruz said Trump’s "only economic agenda is imposing massive taxes on the American people with a 40 percent tax hike of a giant tariff." Tariffs are not Trump’s "only" economic proposal. But Trump has trumpeted taxing Mexican and Chinese imports by 35 and 45 percent respectively. Most economists agree that American consumers and manufactures would bear some of the cost of these tariffs, though it’s not entirely clear if prices would increase by 40 percent, as Cruz says. Cruz’s claim is partially accurate.

pomt-05290	Says Mitt Romney is wrong to claim that spending under Obama has "accelerated at a pace without precedent in recent history," because it's actually risen "slower than at any time in nearly 60 years."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/may/23/facebook-posts/viral-facebook-post-says-barack-obama-has-lowest-s/	EDITOR'S NOTE: This item prompted a large volume and feedback and comments. We published an article about the comments on May 25 and an update to this item on May 31. You'll find the update below, at the end of the fact-check. On May 22, 2012, Rex Nutting, the international commentary editor for the financial website MarketWatch, published a column titled, "Obama spending binge never happened." Nutting’s column explored data on federal spending patterns during recent presidencies, concluding that -- contrary to the tax-and-spend stereotype of Democrats -- President Barack Obama has actually presided over the smallest increases in federal spending of any recent president. The column went viral. Within hours, people who liked the column were posting a graphic on Facebook that paired a line from Nutting’s column with a quote from Mitt Romney’s campaign website. Under the heading, "Romney’s World," the Facebook post quoted a Romney Web page saying, "Since President Obama assumed office three years ago, federal spending has accelerated at a pace without precedent in recent history." (That accurately quotes Romney.) Immediately to the right, under the heading, "Real World," the Facebook post provided a retort using a caption from Nutting’s key chart: "Government spending under Obama, including his signature stimulus bill, is rising at a 1.4 percent annualized pace — slower than at any time in nearly 60 years." (The post cited the quotation to the Wall Street Journal; technically, Nutting writes for MarketWatch, which is an affiliate of the Wall Street Journal.) The Facebook post appears to have originated with the liberal blog Groobiecat Call, which promises "data-driven analysis" and "lefteous indignation." Before the day was out, roughly a dozen PolitiFact readers had forwarded it to us, seeking our view of its accuracy. So we looked into it. Nutting’s column First, let’s recap what Nutting said in his column: "Almost everyone believes that Obama has presided over a massive increase in federal spending, an ‘inferno’ of spending that threatens our jobs, our businesses and our children’s future. Even Democrats seem to think it’s true. But it didn’t happen. Although there was a big stimulus bill under Obama, federal spending is rising at the slowest pace since Dwight Eisenhower brought the Korean War to an end in the 1950s." Nutting ran the numbers for the past 60 years, adjusting for the fact that "the first year of every presidential term starts with a budget approved by the previous administration and Congress." For Obama, that means that "the 2009 fiscal year, which Republicans count as part of Obama’s legacy, began four months before Obama moved into the White House. The major spending decisions in the 2009 fiscal year were made by George W. Bush and the previous Congress." He continued, "By no means did Obama try to reverse that spending. Indeed, his budget proposals called for even more spending in subsequent years. But the Congress (mostly Republicans but many Democrats, too) stopped him. If Obama had been a king who could impose his will, perhaps what the Republicans are saying about an Obama spending binge would be accurate." Nutting did, however, attribute a portion of fiscal 2009 spending to Obama rather than Bush. He reassigned about $140 billion, covering spending made that year through the stimulus bill, the expansion of a children’s health-care program and other appropriations bills passed in the spring of 2009. "If we attribute that $140 billion in stimulus to Obama and not to Bush," Nutting wrote, "we find that spending under Obama grew by about $200 billion over four years, amounting to a 1.4 percent annualized increase." Our analysis Before presenting our own calculations, we’ll get some methodological issues out of the way. Like Nutting, we used historical data from the Office of Management and Budget along with projections from the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office. Projecting outlays into the future involves a degree of uncertainty, but CBO’s most recent projections are considered the most independent and reliable. Because we’re checking the Facebook post rather than Nutting’s column, we examined the way the post compared the presidents. Since the Facebook post ignores differences between presidents’ first and second terms, which are noted in Nutting’s chart, we’ve combined presidents’ entire tenures into a single time span. And several presidents who served during the past 60 years didn’t have tenures that coincided precisely with fiscal years, due to assassination or resignation. So we’re using the closest fiscal years we can, and we’re skipping President Gerald Ford, whose tenure was too short to adequately measure. Here are the average spending increases per year in raw dollars (not adjusted for inflation) in descending order by president: President Fiscal year baseline Last fiscal year Average percentage increase per year Carter 1977 1981 16.4 Nixon 1969 1975 13.5 Johnson 1964 1969 11.0 George W. Bush 2001 2009 10.2 Reagan 1981 1989 8.6 Kennedy 1961 1964 7.1 George H.W. Bush 1989 1993 5.8 Clinton 1993 2001 4.0 Eisenhower 1953 1961 3.6 Obama 2009 2013 1.4 So, using raw dollars, Obama did oversee the lowest annual increases in spending of any president in 60 years. Here are the results using inflation-adjusted figures: President Fiscal year baseline Last fiscal year Average percentage increase per year Johnson 1964 1969 6.3 George W. Bush 2001 2009 5.9 Kennedy 1961 1964 4.7 Carter 1977 1981 4.2 Nixon 1969 1975 3.0 Reagan 1981 1989 2.7 George H.W. Bush 1989 1993 1.8 Clinton 1993 2001 1.5 Obama 2009 2013 -0.1 Eisenhower 1953 1961 -0.5 So, using inflation-adjusted dollars, Obama had the second-lowest increase -- in fact, he actually presided over a decrease once inflation is taken into account. Bottom line: The Facebook post’s claim that government spending under Obama is "slower than at any time in nearly 60 years" is very close to accurate. Explaining the results So why the disconnect between Obama’s image as a big spender and the reality of how much federal spending has actually grown? First, Obama’s record on debt is a lot less flattering than is his record on federal government spending. During the same time that spending is poised to be increasing by 1.4 percent per year under Obama, the debt will be increasing by 14.6 percent per year. The reason? Year by year, federal revenues haven’t been keeping up with spending, due to the struggling national economy (which has held back tax revenues) and a continuation of tax cuts. And each year there’s an annual deficit, the national debt grows. Second, federal spending under Obama is higher as a share of gross domestic product than it has been in most of the previous 60 years. That, too is because of the economy, which has simultaneously slowed the growth of GDP and boosted government spending for programs such as food stamps and Medicaid. Third, the aging of the baby boomers has driven a rise in entitlement spending that is masking cuts Obama and the GOP Congress have made, and have promised to make, in discretionary spending. Using outlays as the unit of measurement, as Nutting and the Facebook post have done, means focusing on money already spent. It does not take into account future spending that’s been committed to but not yet carried out. And finally, many Americans associate Obama with the high-profile legislative activities of his first year or two, when initiatives such as the stimulus sent spending upward the fastest. Since then, spending has slowed, thanks in part to spending cuts pushed by congressional Republicans. Which brings us to another important issue: The president is not all-powerful, so his record on spending was accomplished in collaboration with congressional Republicans. Our ruling The Facebook post says Mitt Romney is wrong to claim that spending under Obama has "accelerated at a pace without precedent in recent history," because it's actually risen "slower than at any time in nearly 60 years." Obama has indeed presided over the slowest growth in spending of any president using raw dollars, and it was the second-slowest if you adjust for inflation. The math simultaneously backs up Nutting’s calculations and demolishes Romney’s contention. The only significant shortcoming of the graphic is that it fails to note that some of the restraint in spending was fueled by demands from congressional Republicans. On balance, we rate the claim Mostly True. UPDATE, May 31, 2012 While we have already shared some of the critiques of this fact-check in a previous follow-up story, critics have since noted that two of our fellow fact checkers -- the Washington Post Fact Checker and the Associated Press -- offered more negative rulings on related claims. The Fact Checker addressed the apparent discrepancy succinctly in a follow-up column, saying "we did not evaluate the same thing." There’s a widespread misconception that we gave a Mostly True rating to Rex Nutting’s MarketWatch column. After our original fact-check published, White House spokesman Jay Carney tweeted, "PolitiFact backs MarketWatch analysis of federal spending under POTUS & predecessors." Many conservative bloggers read our fact-check the same way, as they attacked us. The assumption made by both sides is wrong. We examined at a Facebook post that said Mitt Romney is wrong to claim that spending under Obama has "accelerated at a pace without precedent in recent history," because it's actually risen "slower than at any time in nearly 60 years." The Facebook post does rely partly on Nutting’s work, and our item addresses that, but we did not simply give our seal of approval to everything Nutting wrote. In fact, half of the Facebook post stems from something else entirely -- a claim on Mitt Romney’s website. Using and slightly tweaking Nutting’s methodology, we recalculated spending increases under each president back to Dwight Eisenhower and produced tables ranking the presidents from highest spenders to lowest spenders. By contrast, both the Fact Checker and the AP zeroed in on one narrower (and admittedly crucial) data point -- how to divide the responsibility between George W. Bush and Obama for the spending that occurred in fiscal year 2009, when spending rose fastest. How you divide the spending between Bush and Obama for fiscal 2009 only makes a difference to our ruling if the shifts move Obama significantly up or down our rankings. Do they? Nutting attributed spending from the first year of every presidential term to the previous administration, arguing that every new president starts their term four months into a fiscal year begun under their predecessor. Historically, this has not been a particularly controversial approach, and even some of Nutting’s critics we spoke to agreed that it’s not a bad rule of thumb. But fiscal year 2009 was special because it came amid an economic and financial free fall that drove the nation’s leaders to spend a lot more than they ordinarily would. Nutting did take these factors into account, but not to the extent that some critics think is needed. Nutting shifted $140 billion in fiscal 2009 spending from two of Obama’s signature programs -- the economic stimulus package and an expansion of the Children’s Health Insurance Program -- out of Bush’s column and into Obama’s. He also shifted excess spending beyond what Bush would have spent from the appropriations bills signed by Obama in 2009. A number of critics also argued that spending for the Troubled Asset Relief Program should be taken into account. This program aided troubled financial institutions and involved a lot of money going out the door in fiscal 2009 and a lot of money coming in the door in subsequent years as the money was paid back to the treasury. The critics note that counting the TARP expenses as Bush’s artificially raises the baseline level of spending Obama inherited, thereby making Obama’s subsequent spending increases seem unrealistically small. We think reasonable people can disagree on which president should be responsible for TARP spending, but to give the critics their say, we’ll include it in our alternative calculation. So, combining the fiscal 2009 costs for programs that are either clearly or arguably Obama’s -- the stimulus, the CHIP expansion, the incremental increase in appropriations over Bush’s level and TARP -- produces a shift from Bush to Obama of between $307 billion and $456 billion, based on the most reasonable estimates we’ve seen critics offer. That’s quite a bit larger than Nutting’s $140 billion, but by our calculations, it would only raise Obama’s average annual spending increase from 1.4 percent to somewhere between 3.4 percent and 4.9 percent. That would place Obama either second from the bottom or third from the bottom out of the 10 presidents we rated, rather than last. When we encounter a compound claim such as this one, we consider the accuracy of each part separately. During our internal discussions, we give a preliminary rating to each half of a claim, then average them to produce our final, published rating. Our extensive consultations with budget analysts since our item was published convinces us that there’s no single "correct" way to divvy up fiscal 2009 spending, only a variety of plausible calculations. So the second portion of the Facebook claim -- that Obama’s spending has risen "slower than at any time in nearly 60 years" -- strikes us as Half True. Meanwhile, we would’ve given a True rating to the Facebook claim that Romney is wrong to say that spending under Obama has "accelerated at a pace without precedent in recent history." Even using the higher of the alternative measurements, at least seven presidents had a higher average annual increases in spending. That balances out to our final rating of Mostly True.

pomt-06022	"Mayor Barrett saved Milwaukee $25 million, thanks to Gov. Walker’s reforms."	mostly true	/wisconsin/statements/2012/jan/15/club-growth/wisconsin-club-growth-says-milwaukee-mayor-tom-bar/	Those billboards around Milwaukee featuring Mayor Tom Barrett’s mug and a claim he "saved Milwaukee $25 million" are clever if you slow down to read the punch line. If you can do it without driving your car into an embankment, you’ll see they are sponsored by the conservative Wisconsin Club for Growth and give credit to Barrett’s once -- and possibly future -- gubernatorial rival, Scott Walker, for making the savings possible. Barrett, the signs’ smaller print says, got the savings "thanks to Gov. Scott Walker’s reforms." The billboards hit on a theme voters undoubtedly will hear over and over from Republicans if Barrett takes on Walker in a possible recall election in 2012. The billboards refer to Walker’s controversial budget legislation that took health care and pensions out of collective bargaining for most public employees. That allowed local governments and schools to impose cost-sharing for those benefits instead of negotiating with labor leaders. Barrett’s campaign, reacting to the ad, denounced it as completely off base, in a statement to WTMJ4 that said: "The only thing accurate about that billboard is the picture of Tom Barrett." What’s the truth? Club for Growth didn’t respond, but the Journal Sentinel reported in August that the city of Milwaukee will indeed save $25 million in 2012 just on health care costs, in large part by asking employees to pay more. In fact, Barrett’s budget document said revisions to the city’s health insurance -- the ones made easier by Walker’s changes -- would help drive overall health care costs down for the first time in more than 20 years. We contacted the same Milwaukee budget official quoted in August 2011, and he told us the city still expects a $25 million drop in health costs. Case closed? The official, city economist Dennis Yaccarino, says the $25 million actually overstates savings related to the Walker budget alone. He said city officials didn’t make that clear in early August when a Journal Sentinel reporter first got the number from the city and published the $25 million figure in the context of Walker’s changes. That story ran Aug. 8, 2011. The newspaper followed up August 21, 2011, quoting city officials saying $6 million of that savings number was from the city’s own decision to switch from an insured HMO to a self-funded approach due to projected cost savings. The $6 million switch is noted that way in Barrett’s budget. The move, we should note, was negotiated with the city’s largest union two years ago but was not put in place until now for reasons unrelated to the state budget, according to Yaccarino and Richard Abelson, executive director of the American Federation of State County and Municipal Employees, which represents general city employees. Yaccarino said the city calculated in 2011 that it was paying a profit to its carrier and could keep the money for itself by going self insured. That scenario had not existed until 2011, hence the delay, he said. So that leaves $19 million of savings for Milwaukee from Walker’s original budget plan and the amended one he signed, right? Not exactly. Remember, the $25 million figure is just on the health care costs side fo the equation. What about public employees paying more in pension costs? That’s the second part of Walker’s limits on collective bargaining over benefits. Milwaukee didn’t put them in place due to questions about the legality of the state changes as they apply to Milwaukee. So that’s a 0. Finally, city official note Walker’s overall budget cut municipal aid, leaving the net "savings" to the city much reduced from $19 million. But the billboard refers to Walker’s "reforms," which is the changes tied to the collective bargaining issue. It is making a narrower claim, on how much was saved from the reforms, not how the city fared overall. Our conclusion Billboards say Walker’s "reforms" allowed Milwaukee Mayor Tom Barrett to save $25 million for the city. The city is that much ahead, but a portion was Barrett’s doing before Walker’s budget was enacted. We rate the claim Mostly True.

pomt-11315	"Red Crescent Says No Evidence of Chemical Attack in Syria’s Douma."	false	/punditfact/statements/2018/apr/13/antiwarcom/syrian-red-crescent-did-not-deny-chemical-attack-d/	On April 7, reports emerged from Syria’s civil war that residents of the city of Douma east of Damascus were potential victims of chemical weapons. The reports have yet to be confirmed, but footage of women and children foaming at the mouth threaten to draw a military strike by Western forces. The California-based non-interventionist website Antiwar.com posted an article saying the Syrian Red Crescent, which is a member of the international Red Cross/Red Crescent federation, rejected the idea of a chemical attack. "The Syrian Red Crescent issued a statement Monday dismissing the allegations of a weekend chemical weapon attack in the city of Douma," the April 9 article said. "The statement insisted their medical personnel in the city had found no evidence any such attack took place." PolitiFact contacted the Syrian Arab Red Crescent (the organization typically includes the Arab designation) to confirm the statement. "We are not aware of such a declaration," said Rana Sidani Cassou in the Beirut office of the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies. "Neither the Syrian Arab Red Crescent nor the International Federation are in a position to confirm or deny any attack." In fact, during the April 7 attack, Syrian jets had targeted the Syrian Red Crescent hospital in Douma and the next day, the group tweeted that the Douma branch had shut down. When we contacted Eric Garris, director of Antiwar.com, the website retracted the article, and posted a new one with the headline "Report of Syrian Red Crescent Statement on Alleged Douma Attack Incorrect." Garris told PolitiFact that they based the original story on an article that appeared April 8 on the Russian-state sponsored news website Tass. That article said the Syrian Red Crescent had issued a statement. We can’t verify that. The Tass article quotes doctors who work with the Syrian Red Crescent talking about an attack that took place in January. Garris said his news editor believes Tass might have changed the article from the version he first saw. Garris said his group moved ahead with the story, even though he did not find confirmation on the Syrian Red Crescent website. "I have no excuse for letting it slip through like this," Garris said. "We should have been more diligent. There’s enough misinformation out there, and we don’t want to be a part of that." The retraction said, "In the future, we will not use foreign news sources as the sole source for important articles like this." Our ruling The Antiwar.com website said that the Syrian Red Crescent had issued a statement saying that they found no evidence of a chemical attack in Douma. The organization’s director said that was based on an article from the Russian news service Tass. The Syrian Arab Red Crescent did not make such a statement. Antiwar.com posted a full retraction of its article and apologized for the mistake. We rate this claim False.

pomt-02027	Says Michele Bachmann said on Fox News, "This country could use a president like Benjamin Franklin again."	pants on fire!	/punditfact/statements/2014/jun/05/facebook-posts/did-michele-bachmann-say-country-could-use-preside/	Misleading memes about U.S. Rep. Michele Bachmann, R-Minn., continue to give our readers pause. We’ve twice debunked wild posts claiming Bachmann said Jesus wrote the Bible in English and that she said President Barack Obama might be responsible for the April Fort Hood, Texas, shooting spree. Both quotes were made up, so they got our Pants on Fire rating. Recently, a reader asked us to investigate a third post, a screenshot of Bachmann in mid speech with a quote overlay. "The nation has gotten away from the principles of the founding fathers under the failed leadership of Barack Obama. This country could use a president like Benjamin Franklin again," the posts quotes Bachmann as saying on Fox News on May 28. If this were a baseball game, we’d call "strike three!" Yes, Bachmann is no fan of Obama. Yes, she is known to bring up the founding fathers, sometimes to controversial ends. But no, she did not remember iconic American Ben Franklin as a past president. Franklin signed the Declaration of Independence and the U.S. Constitution, served as the nation’s first postmaster general and later as U.S. ambassador to France. But he was never president. A search of transcripts and news stories for the quote came up dry. Bachmann spokesman Dat Kotman said she did not even appear on Fox that day, and we could not find any evidence that she did. As if the meme weren't fishy enough, the screenshot is also the backdrop for the fake quote about Fort Hood. It’s originally from Bachmann’s June 2013 interview on Fox News’ Hannity when she discussed her decision to leave Congress at the end of her term in January 2015. The post appears to track back to a satirical group called "Christians for Michele Bachmann." Bachmann did extol Franklin in a high-profile address, but she did not refer to him as a president. She referenced Franklin twice in a speech announcing that she was abandoning her 2012 presidential bid. Bachmann alluded to a painting by Howard Chandler Christy of the signing of the U.S. Constitution, which hangs in a stairway in the Capitol’s House wing. She remembers seeing the painting, with its reminder of the "connection we have to the principles of freedom and justice," on the night she decided to seek the Oval Office. Benjamin Franklin is seated distinctly in the center of the painting, one of the most visible figures in a sea of powdered wigs. "But never was the painting's reminder more poignant than on the evening of March 21, 2010, the day Obamacare was passed," Bachmann said. "Staring out from the painting is the face of Ben Franklin as a consistent reminder of the fragile Republic he and the founders gave to us." She did not refer to him as a past president then, and we could not find other examples of her mistaking him for a president. Our ruling A meme claims that Bachmann said, "This country could use a president like Benjamin Franklin again." This quote is made up. Bachmann wasn't on TV the night of her alleged remarks and we could find no reference of her claiming Franklin was president. We rate the claim Pants on Fire.

pomt-03776	College students "who are NOT U.S. Citizens and who get the PELL Grant" plan to return to their home countries after getting free gas cards and child care.	pants on fire!	/florida/statements/2013/apr/01/chain-email/email-florida-teacher-says-dominican-student/	Did you hear the one about foreign students ripping off the U.S. by getting federal grants to go to college and then ditching our country to return home? The chain email from "a Florida teacher" arrived in our inbox March 28, 2013. It reads: "This is a subject close to my heart. Do you know that we have adult students at the school where I teach who are NOT U.S. Citizens and who get the PELL Grant, which is a federal grant (no payback required) plus other federal grants to go to school? "One student from the Dominican Republic told me that she didn't want me to find a job for her after she finished my program, because she was getting housing from our housing department and she was getting a PELL Grant which paid for her total tuition and books, plus money left over." The email also stated that this Dominican student accessed other special programs that supplied her with a credit card for gas and another to pay for daycare. The email continued: "The one student I just mentioned told me she was not going to be a U.S. citizen because she plans to return to the Dominican Republic someday and that she 'loves HER country.’ I asked her if she felt guilty taking what the U.S. is giving her and then not even bothering to become a citizen and she told me that it doesn't bother her, because that is what the money is there for!" We wanted to research if a noncitizen can get a Pell Grant to go to college with no intention of becoming a citizen and then simply return to their home country. As we soon discovered, this chain email has had a long life -- it was debunked in fact-checks by Snopes.com and Factcheck.org in 2008. Pell Grants Pell Grants are federal awards to low-income students for post-secondary education. The grants are for students to obtain bachelor's degrees or certain postbaccalaureate programs that lead to teacher certification. The grant does not have to be repaid, and the maximum amount for this year is $5,550. Citizens can get the grants. Also, students who are permanent residents -- commonly referred to as those who have a "green card" -- are considered eligible noncitizens and can get student aid if they meet eligibility criteria, said Jane Glickman, a U.S. Department of Education spokeswoman. We couldn’t find statistics on how many of the 9.7 million Pell Grant recipients are green-card holders, but Glickman said the vast majority are citizens. The chain email also claimed that the Pell Grant would pay for "total tuition and books, plus money left over." It appears highly unlikely our Dominican student would be profiting from the Pell Grant, since the average price of a four-year college education is far above the grant. (PolitiFact’s 2011 analysis showed it covered about 34 percent of public college costs.) The email also suggested that this Dominican student is seeking a free ride from the United States and giving nothing in return. Legal permanent residents who get Pell Grants can choose to return to their country, however, the majority eventually apply for citizenship. And they do pay taxes. Other programs mentioned in the email The chain email claimed that the Dominican student was accessing two other programs, called WAIT and CARIBE, to help pay for expenses: "She was looking into WAIT which gives students a CREDIT CARD for gas to come to school, and into CARIBE which is a special program (check it out - I did) for immigrants, and it pays for child care and all sorts of needs while they go to school or training." C.A.R.I.B.E. – Career Recruitment And Instruction In Basic English Refugee Program -- is a federally funded adult education program in Hillsborough County Public Schools. The program’s website explains that it "provides English language, GED, and Hi-Tec vocational training to recent Cuban, Haitian, and other entrants with legal, documented refugee or asylee status." (The website puts those two words in bold.) Program manager Estela Weideman told PolitiFact that CARIBE does not provide child care but will refer students to other programs that provide vouchers for child care if they qualify. "All we provide are English classes to the adults, and only those that qualify," Weideman said. The criteria is very specific -- participants must be refugees or asylum seekers, which typically means people fleeing oppressive regimes or war conditions. (In 2008, the director of this Hillsborough County program told Factcheck that he had received more than 600 emails about the chain letter and had received calls around the country, including from congressional offices.) Several other counties in Florida have similar adult education programs for refugees including in Miami-Dade County. It’s unlikely that this alleged Dominican student would qualify for Hillsborough’s program, though. State Department refugee admission statistics for 2012 do not show any refugees from the Dominican Republic. We also found no Dominicans were U.S. refugees from 2002 to 2011. The picture was more complex for those seeking asylum -- one category referred to as seeking asylum "defensively" as part of a removal hearing included tiny numbers from the Dominican Republican -- eight in 2011, for example. We couldn’t find anything on the other program mentioned in the email -- WAIT -- that would supposedly provide students with gas to go to school. This program doesn’t appear to exist. Our ruling The chain email paints a picture of free-loading foreigners, college students "who are NOT U.S. citizens and who get the PELL Grant," then return to their home countries after getting free gas cards and child care. While green card residents can get Pell Grants, those people are generally legal permanent residents -- not people looking to return to their own countries. And there’s no free gas cards or child care. We rate the chain email’s claim Pants on Fire!	None	Chain email	None	None	None	2013-04-01T11:52:46	2013-03-28	['None']

pomt-06175	"The American Conservative Union gives [Rep. Tim] Ryan a dismal 0.0 percent rating for the billions he has contributed to our national debt."	mostly false	/ohio/statements/2011/dec/14/marish-agana/republican-challenger-marisha-agana-says-us-rep-ti/	Since arriving in Congress after a hard-fought 2002 campaign, Tim Ryan hasn’t had to break much of a sweat to keep his seat representing the heavily Democratic 17th District. He plans to compete for sixth term next year in the reconfigured 13th District, part of a Republican-drawn map that eliminates two Ohio seats because of slow population growth. And though the Niles Democrat’s Youngstown-Warren base remains intact, the district now includes more of Akron and Summit County to the west, as well as a portion of Stark County. Two candidates have filed signatures to challenge him in the primary, but conventional wisdom says Ryan will cruise into the 2012 general election. Which brings us to Marisha Agana. Agana, a pediatrician from the Warren suburb of Howland Township, is running for the seat as a Republican. Despite the political makeup of the district, she is positioning herself as an unquestionable conservative and casting Ryan as an unabashed liberal. "Our Democratic incumbent is a prime example of the problem throughout Congress," Agana said in a news release announcing her candidacy. "The American Conservative Union gives Ryan a dismal 0.0 percent rating for the billions he has contributed to our national debt." The second part of Agana’s statement caught PolitiFact Ohio’s eye. As congressional campaigns ratchet up in the coming months, candidates are sure to use such partisan rankings in hopes of defining their opponents as too liberal or too conservative. But given Ryan’s pro-gun and anti-abortion proclivities, we wondered if Agana’s was playing fair. First, some background on ACU. The Alexandria, Va., advocacy group bills itself as the nation’s "oldest and largest grassroots conservative organization." In February, ACU released its annual congressional ratings, based on how the 435 House members decided on 24 issues in 2010. "The votes selected in this edition of the ACU Ratings of Congress are not always considered the ‘most important’ votes as defined by others," the group says on its website. "Instead, the votes selected are chosen to create a clear ideological distinction among those casting them." Congressional representatives are rated based on how often they vote in accordance with ACU beliefs on those selected topics. Votes tracked in 2010 ranged from the establishment of Native Hawaiian sovereignty to the extension of unemployment benefits. (ACU opposed both.) Ryan’s votes on all 24 measures put him at odds with the group, earning him a 0 percent. Historically, though, Ryan has a slightly better record on ACU issues. In 2009, when he was in agreement with the organization on one of 25 votes, he received a 4 percent rating. Overall, for the eight full years he has served in Congress, Ryan has an 13.25 percent rating. Agana obviously was referring to Ryan’s most recent 0 percent rating. She also attributed the goose egg to the "billions he has contributed to our national debt." Not only does that claim contain hyperbole that might give the impression Ryan alone has contributed billions of dollars to the national debt, it also is far less verifiable. And we checked with ACU spokeswoman Kristy Campbell, who said that the ratings are based on votes in "three main areas." Besides fiscal issues, which would include the debt, ACU also looks for "strong national defense" votes and "social/traditional values," Campbell said via email. "As many of the votes we rate are related to spending and fiscal discipline, it is not inaccurate to say the congressman received a 0.0 score in 2010 because of his contribution to the national debt," Campbell added. "However, last year, he also received a 0.00 percent rating across the spectrum of other issues important to conservatives," including the "Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell" repeal. Most of the votes ACU rates could be classified directly or indirectly as a fiscal issue because of spending requirements and the impact on the budget. But as even Campbell acknowledges, Ryan’s votes on these issues do not represent the entire reason he received a 0 percent rating. Agana paints Ryan with too broad a brush in her statement. While it’s true his most recent ACU rating was 0, Ryan has a higher lifetime score than all but two Ohio Democrats ranked in 2010: Rep. Zack Space, who lost a re-election bid last year, and Rep. Marcy Kaptur of Toledo. Ryan is no conservative, but he is more moderate than Agana implied. As for the "billions" of dollars for which Agana holds Ryan directly responsible, spokeswoman Patricia Brant told PolitiFact Ohio that the campaign was stating a simple "cause and effect." Brant said votes on certain fiscal issues added billions of dollars to the federal deficit. The national debt is the accumulation of annual budget deficits. But for PolitiFact Ohio, simplicity should not come at the expense of accuracy. Agana’s statement is an exaggeration. Her words exclusively tagged Ryan, one of 435 congressional representatives, with adding billions of dollars to the debt. While there is some truth at the core of her argument, Agana played too fast and loose with the facts. On the Truth-O-Meter, her claim merits a rating of Mostly False.

pomt-03769	"Opponents of Section 5 (of the Voting Rights Act) complain of state expense, yet their only cost is the paper, postage and manpower required to send copies of legislation to the federal government for review."	half-true	/georgia/statements/2013/apr/03/john-lewis/costs-associated-voting-rights-act-can-vary-case/	A Supreme Court decision on a key provision of the 1965 Voting Rights Act could come in June. The court heard arguments in late February on Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act, which requires Georgia and eight other states with a history of discrimination -- Alabama, Alaska, Arizona, Louisiana, Mississippi, South Carolina, Texas and Virginia -- to get permission, or "preclearance," from the federal government before implementing any changes affecting elections. The provision is being challenged by Shelby County, Ala., and also applies to parts of seven other states. Opponents of the provision, including Georgia Attorney General Sam Olens, say the blatant racial intimidation and discrimination that existed in voting processes decades ago no longer exist. They also say the formula used to determine which states are covered under the statute is outdated because it is based on voter turnout and registration data from 1972. They also cite the high cost for adhering to Section 5 requirements when states or jurisdictions want to make changes to their elections processes. Georgia was one of several states that filed a "friend of the court" brief supporting Shelby County’s suit. The Justice Department has rejected election changes in Georgia nearly 180 times under the Section 5 provision. Throughout the challenge, U.S. Rep. John Lewis, a Democrat from Georgia and a civil rights pioneer, has been a crusader for keeping Section 5, and he made his case in an opinion column for The Washington Post a few days before the court arguments. "Opponents of Section 5 complain of state expense, yet their only cost is the paper, postage and manpower required to send copies of legislation to the federal government for reviews, hardly a punishment," Lewis wrote. But what about court costs and attorneys’ fees? Did states not have these expenses, too? We wondered whether Lewis’ low-cost compliance analysis was correct. After years of efforts, particularly in Southern states, to prevent blacks from voting, voting rights battles reached a peak in 1965. Early that year, Lewis and other voting rights marchers crossing the Edmund Pettus Bridge in Selma, Ala., on their way to Montgomery, the state capital, were attacked by state troopers. That attack, along with other violent incidents in the South against blacks and activists, persuaded President Lyndon Johnson to push for a strong voting rights law that eventually became the Voting Rights Act. Section 5 of the act, including the preclearance review requirement for specific jurisdictions seeking elections changes, was extended in 1970, 1975, 1982 and for 25 years in 2006. The Voting Section of the Department of Justice reviews 15,000 to 24,000 voting changes each year, and receives between 4,500 and 5,500 Section 5 submissions. Jurisdictions seeking a preclearance review have two options under Section 5: a declaratory judgment process and an administrative review process. The declaratory judgment process is a court-intensive process that involves the jurisdiction’s filing a motion with the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia. A three-judge panel hears the request. Any appeals go directly to the U.S. Supreme Court. The administrative review process is designed to be an expeditious, cost-effective alternative. It involves jurisdictions’ submitting proposed voting changes to the Civil Rights Division of the Department of Justice for review. If the attorney general doesn’t object to the change, or if no objection is filed within 60 days, then the jurisdiction can implement the change. The DOJ provides a list of documents and information jurisdictions must submit for the administrative review, including a reason for the change, the date the change would take effect and contact information for the agency in charge of enforcing the election change. The DOJ reports that more than 99 percent of the changes affecting voting are reviewed administratively. Administrative review documents can be filed by mail and online. States choosing the declaratory judgment process first, or after a voting change was denied in the administrative process, can accrue large legal bills. For example, South Carolina spent $3.5 million last year challenging a DOJ rejection of its proposed voter ID law. After taking the case to court, the three-judge declaratory judgment panel ruled in January in the state’s favor and precleared the law for 2013. The federal government was ordered to pay $54,000 of the state’s costs. Texas also appealed a rejection of a redistricting plan. That appeal before the Supreme Court is likely on hold until the Shelby County case is decided. But several states covered in whole or part by Section 5 -- California, Mississippi, New York, and North Carolina -- support its constitutionality, and in an amicus brief they filed in the Shelby County case, they wrote that "its compliance burdens are minimal." Lewis’ office points out that the litigation costs associated with the declaratory judgment process are optional, unless a jurisdiction wants to challenge that decision through a lawsuit. Lewis’ assessment of the compliance costs is fair, said Myrna Perez, deputy director of the Democracy Program at the Brennan Center for Justice, a left-leaning think tank/advocacy group. Perez has reviewed several elections changes filed by different states. But Charles Bullock, a political science professor at the University of Georgia who has done studies on the impact of the Voting Rights Act in Georgia, said the administrative review route may be simple and inexpensive for trivial changes, such as moving a polling place from a fire station to a school. With more complex changes, such as redistricting plans, though, even the administrative review route can be complicated and carry indirect costs, he said. Georgia spent hundreds of thousands of dollars in legal fees for outside attorneys -- not including work done by internal office staff -- for a federal judicial review of the state’s redistricting plan in 2001. In March 2002, the state Legislature passed a midyear budget that included $1.8 million for legal fees to defend the plan. "You will have to provide the alternative plans that were considered and rejected, votes on those plans," Bullock said. "I have no idea of the costs, but there is a fair amount of manpower to do this." And that manpower has a cost, he said. So does Lewis’ claim balance the scales of justice? Lewis said that opponents of Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act, which requires certain jurisdictions to obtain preclearance from the federal government to implement elections changes, are wrong when they say adhering to the requirements can be expensive. Lewis says the cost is minimal, with states only having to fund the paper, postage and manpower required for submitting the required documents. For administrative reviews on minor issues, Lewis appears to be correct. The Justice Department provides an administrative process for preclearence submissions that is designed to cut litigation costs. And most of the states choose this option. But that option can be expensive. And there is also another more costly option for states that involves taking the case through the court system, which is likely to require significant amounts of money in legal fees. Lewis’ claim is partially accurate but leaves out important details about the second review method’s cost for more complex elections changes. For this missing information, we rated his claim Half True. Staff writer Karishma Mehrotra contributed to this story.	None	John Lewis	None	None	None	2013-04-03T06:00:00	2013-02-24	['None']

pomt-06854	There was a "loss of eight million jobs during the Bush eight years."	pants on fire!	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/aug/03/harry-reid/harry-reid-says-8-million-jobs-lost-during-george-/	During a Senate floor speech on Aug. 2, 2011 -- shortly before a vote on the final debt-ceiling bill -- Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., compared the job-creation records of President Bill Clinton and President George W. Bush. "My friend (Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky.) talks about no new taxes," Reid said. "Mr. President, if their theory was right, with these huge (tax cuts) that took place during the Bush eight years, the economy should be thriving. These tax cuts have not helped the economy. The loss of eight million jobs during the Bush eight years, two wars started, unfunded, all on borrowed money, these tax cuts all on borrowed money -- if the tax cuts were so good, the economy should be thriving. If we go back to the prior eight years during President Clinton’s administration, 23 million new jobs were created." A reader asked us whether Reid was correct that there was a "loss of eight million jobs during the Bush eight years." So we looked into it. As always, we looked at jobs numbers compiled by the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the government’s official source of employment data. During Bush’s eight years in office -- January 2001 to January 2009 -- the nation actually gained a net 1.09 million jobs. (Because there were gains in government jobs, the private sector actually lost 653,000 jobs during that period.) This isn’t remotely close to what Reid claimed. Reid's office didn't respond to our request for information, but we think we know what he was referring to. From the economy’s peak to its low point, the nation lost 8.75 million jobs. Here’s the problem: The peak for jobs came in January 2008, while the low point for jobs came in February 2010. This means the starting point for Reid’s measure came seven years into Bush’s eight-year tenure, and the low point occurred about a year into Barack Obama’s tenure. In other words, Reid had a point in saying that there was a "loss of eight million jobs" -- but it didn’t come "during the Bush eight years." The loss of eight million jobs occurred during a roughly two-year period shared more or less equally between Bush and Obama. Reid may blame Bush’s policies for every single one of those jobs lost -- an opinion he’s entitled to, but one we are unable to fact-check. Still, his statement is incorrect as spoken. Reid went on to say, "If we go back to the prior eight years during President Clinton’s administration, 23 million new jobs were created." We looked at the BLS numbers and found that Reid was basically correct in that claim. From January 1993 to January 2001, the nation gained 22.7 million total jobs. This means that Reid specifically counted Clinton’s job-creation numbers from his inauguration day to the date he exited from office, but he did not do so for Bush, even though he used the Clinton figure as a direct comparison. It strikes us as a clear-cut case of cherry-picking. So where does this leave us? Reid is correct that more than 8 million jobs were lost in the United States during the recent economic downturn, but he’s flat wrong to say that it happened "during the Bush eight years." Compounding the error, Reid makes a direct comparison between Bush and Clinton, yet he uses one method that makes Clinton’s number seem strong and Bush’s number seem weak.

pomt-09982	"About halfway through fiscal year 2009, Washington has run out of money."	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/apr/30/john-boehner/boehner-cites-debt-day-numbers-carefully/	"In short, about halfway through fiscal year 2009, Washington has run out of money." In an op-ed published April 26, House Republican Leader John Boehner laid out a case for "Debt Day." "It is the day of the Fiscal Year — beginning on Oct. 1 of the previous calendar year — on which total government spending exceeds total federal revenues," Boehner wrote. "And in our current fiscal year, that falls on April 26 — this Sunday, just days before the administration’s 100th day milestone. In short, about halfway through fiscal year 2009, Washington has run out of money." Now keep in mind, we know "Debt Day" is not a literal concept. Thanks to withholding and estimated taxes, the government collects income tax revenues year-round, and it has other sources of tax revenues as well. It also borrows money by selling U.S. Treasury securities. So the government does not have to shut down because its pockets are empty. Boehner acknowledges that, calling it a symbol of "our government’s arrogant culture of spending." We were intrigued by the "Debt Day" claim and wanted to check Boehner's numbers for accuracy. He uses numbers provided by the Congressional Budget Office that are widely regarded as fair and accurate. And he accurately explains how he uses them to calculate debt. Boehner blames the Obama administration for a "borrowing binge" in his editorial, but it's only fair to note that the 2009 budget started back on Oct. 1, 2008, when Boehner's fellow Republican George W. Bush was president. Parts of that budget were finalized, however, under Obama's watch on March 11, 2009. Boehner also notes accurately that "Debt Day" has arrived earlier this year than any time in the past decade, since the surpluses that marked the end of the Clinton administration. Here are the "Debt Days" for previous years, based on CBO numbers. Again, it's important to remember the calendar for these dates starts Oct. 1 of the previous year, not Jan. 1. We've also included the percentage of each year's budget that was actually paid with government revenues, as opposed to borrowing: 2002 - Sept. 2 - 92 percent 2003 - July 29 - 83 percent 2004 - July 27 - 82 percent 2005 - Aug. 14 - 87 percent 2006 - Aug. 27 - 91 percent 2007 - Sept. 9 - 94 percent 2008 - Aug. 5 - 84 percent 2009 - April 26 - 57 percent Boehner carefully explains how he arrives at the "Debt Day" number, and he uses widely accepted numbers in his calculations. The statement we're checking here is, "In short, about halfway through fiscal year 2009, Washington has run out of money." That "halfway" number is a little bit of a push; it's actually 57 percent of the year. And, the "run out of money" is metaphorical, not literal. But Boehner is right with his central point that we're spending more money than we're taking in, and that the difference is close to the halfway mark this fiscal year. So we rate his statement True.

pomt-05634	Says "New Jersey has the most educated population of all the states in this country."	mostly true	/new-jersey/statements/2012/mar/23/sheila-oliver/sheila-oliver-claims-new-jerseyans-are-most-educat/	Assembly Speaker Sheila Oliver is tired of hearing people suggest that New Jersey has a problem of adequately educating its residents. In fact, according to Oliver, New Jerseyans are the "most educated" in the nation. The Essex County Democrat extolled the virtues of the Garden State during a Feb. 27 speech at the Rebovich Institute for New Jersey Politics at Rider University. "New Jersey is a great place. We probably have the best strategic position on the East Coast. We have so many natural assets," Oliver told the audience. "And, I’m gonna get into the subject of education in a moment, but I want to tell you New Jersey has the most educated population of all the states in this country. And we need to stop this self-fulfilling efficacy that we’ve got a problem when it comes to adequately educating people in our state." Oliver’s claim about us having the "most educated population of all the states" is not far off, PolitiFact New Jersey found. In recent years, New Jersey has stood in fifth place among the states for the percentage of its residents, 25 years old and over, who have at least a bachelor’s degree, according to data from the U.S. Census Bureau. First, let’s explain the source of Oliver’s statement. To back up the claim, Oliver spokesman Tom Hester Jr. cited various education statistics, including a 2009 news article by U.S. News & World Report about, in part, New Jersey having the highest high school graduation rate in 2006. He also cited a Huffington Post article that claimed the state ranked sixth for the percentage of adults between 25 and 34 years old with college degrees. "New Jersey has the nation’s highest high school graduation rate and ranks at the very top in student achievement and college graduation rates," Hester said in an email. "Quite simply, the Speaker believes that when you combine it all together, NJ has the most educated population." But two experts told us the best measure to determine the "most educated" states is the educational attainment data compiled by the census bureau. Through a spokesman, Thomas Snyder, director of Annual Reports for the National Center for Education Statistics at the U.S. Department of Education, said in an e-mail: "I believe the educational attainment data are the most relevant for this question." David Bills, an associate professor at the University of Iowa’s College of Education, agreed that the educational attainment data is the "best available measure." "I’d call it the best available measure, with the main problem being that many people complete their education after age 25, so this measure will underestimate how many people will eventually get degrees," Bills said in an e-mail. "Not everyone over age 25 has completed their schooling." Now, let’s explain how many New Jersey residents have college degrees. In 2009, 34.5 percent of New Jerseyans, 25 years old and over, had at least a bachelor’s degree, according to the census bureau. In 2010, 35.4 percent of state residents fit the same criteria, according to the census bureau. In both years, New Jersey was in fifth place behind Massachusetts, Colorado, Maryland and Connecticut. Even after accounting for the margins of error attached to those statistics, New Jersey doesn’t place first. So, New Jersey may not have the "most educated" population, but it certainly has one of them. Our ruling In a speech at Rider University, Oliver claimed "New Jersey has the most educated population of all the states in this country." According to educational attainment data from the U.S. Census Bureau, her claim is pretty much on target. In 2009 and 2010, New Jersey ranked fifth for the percentage of its population, 25 years old and over, who have at least a bachelor’s degree. We rate the statement Mostly True.

pomt-01601	"Over 73% of all donations raised (from the ALS Ice Bucket Challenge) are going to fundraising, overhead, executive salaries, and external donations."	pants on fire!	/truth-o-meter/statements/2014/sep/02/blog-posting/bloggers-incorrectly-blast-als-ice-bucket-challeng/	By now, there are very few Americans who haven’t heard of the "ALS Ice Bucket Challenge" -- the social media-driven campaign during the summer of 2014 to dump ice water on your head as a way of raising awareness of the neuromuscular disease ALS and promoting donations to the ALS Association, which funds medical research and support programs for those who have the disease. The effort has led to at least $94 million in donations to the ALS Association -- a jolt of extra funding for a group that last year spent a comparatively modest $26 million. But not everyone is happy about this development. A blog called politicalears.com posted an article stating that the Ice Bucket Challenge was a "fraud" because most of the money was being spent on administration and overhead. The unsigned post was picked up widely on social media feeds; that’s where PolitiFact readers noticed it. Several of them asked us to check it out, so we did. (The website has no contact information, so we were unable to reach the person who wrote the post.) Here are key excerpts from the Aug. 28 blog post, headlined, "Ice bucket fraud: ALS Foundation admits that 73% of donations are not used for ALS research." "We've been duped. America is filled with fun-loving and caring people. The viral ice bucket challenge has combined both our sense of responsibility to our fellow human with fun. And it has been fun! Who didn't love seeing Sarah Palin doused? "But wait? Ice Bucket Challenge donations are nearing $100 MILLION. Where is that money going? According to the ALS Foundation, not towards ALS. "Over 73% of all donations raised are going to fundraising, overhead, executive salaries, and external donations. Less than 27% is actually used for the purpose we donated for. "According to the ECFA, a charitable watchdog, 27% of donations actually making it to the cause they are donated to is unacceptable. In fact, the ECFA won't deem a non-profit as a reliable charity unless at least 80% of donations make it to their intended projects. ... "The ALS Foundation is a terrible organization to send your money. If you decide to take the Ice Bucket Challenge, may I humbly suggest that you select a well-researched charity (on your own, no endorsements here) and send it to them." The post reprints a pie chart taken directly from the ALS Association’s website, showing the following breakdown of expenses: Research: $7.2 million (27 percent) Patient and community services: $5.1 million (19 percent) Public and professional education: $8.5 million (32 percent) Fundraising: $3.6 million (14 percent) Administration: $1.9 million (7 percent) Let’s start by noting some comparatively minor problems. First, the group in question is the ALS Association, not the "ALS Foundation," as the blog post calls it. Second, the ALS Association hasn’t said anything to "admit" the claims asserted in the blog post, as the post’s headline says. In fact, they’ve posted a response to it here. Now for the blog post’s biggest mistakes: • "Over 73% of all donations raised are going to fundraising, overhead, executive salaries, and external donations." Not true. The 73 percent figure appears to come from subtracting everything except for the 27 percent that falls under "research." The charitable way (no pun intended) of viewing the post’s error is that it misread the category headings. If the post had simply said "research accounts for only 27 percent of the ALS Association’s budget," that would be technically correct though still misleading, since the group’s mission statement includes several goals beyond directly sponsoring research. They include raising awareness, serving as a trusted source of information, providing patients with access to support services and advocating for increased funding for research. Once you include "patient and community services" and "public and professional education" as legitimate spending to advance the group’s stated mission, the percentage spent on items supporting those goals rises to nearly 79 percent. But the blog post actually exacerbated its error by specifically labeling 73 percent of the group’s spending as "fundraising, overhead, executive salaries and external donations." That’s flat wrong. We’ll add that if anyone wants to donate money to the association for research only, they can do that. "If a donor would like 100% of their donation to go to research, he/she can simply check a box on our online donation form here," the association’s website says. "If a donor already donated and would like to redirect their donation, please email us at donations@alsa-national.org." • The role of ECFA. The post cites standards by ECFA, the Evangelical Council for Financial Accountability, a group founded in 1979 that "enhances trust in Christ-centered churches and ministries by establishing and applying Seven Standards of Responsible Stewardship to accredited organizations." However, when we contacted ECFA, Dan Busby, the group’s president, told PolitiFact that his group does not advance the argument made in the post. "We were very surprised to see the ALS-related report which attributes certain statements to ECFA," Dan Busby, the group’s president, told PolitiFact. "We did not provide any information for the story." Busby added that, contrary to what the blog post said, his group doesn’t have a "bright line" test for a charity’s appropriate spending percentage. "The data of applicants and members which reflect high overhead expenses are carefully analyzed for propriety," he said. "In addition to considering the financial picture of a potential donee charity, we believe donors should also look at other attributes, including the charity's commitment to effective board governance, financial integrity, and appropriate accountability." Other groups that analyze charities have given the ALS Association high scores. Charity Navigator, for instance, gave the ALS Association a score of four stars out of four for financial standards and transparency and accountability. The association is "Top Rated" by Charity Watch, is accredited by the Better Business Bureau and is a Guidestar Exchange gold participant. Our ruling The blog post said that "over 73 percent of all donations raised (from the ALS Ice Bucket Challenge) are going to fundraising, overhead, executive salaries, and external donations." Whether purposely or by incompetence, the anonymous blogger misreported the ALS Association’s figures. In reality, nearly 79 percent of the ALS Association’s expenditures were for purposes that advance its stated mission. Fundraising, overhead and executive salaries account for no more than 21 percent. We rate the claim Pants on Fire.	None	Bloggers	None	None	None	2014-09-02T15:49:28	2014-08-28	['None']

pomt-05544	Says the Obama administration "will no longer enforce the Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA)."	half-true	/florida/statements/2012/apr/09/vern-buchanan/vern-buchanan-says-obama-will-no-longer-enforce/	The Human Rights Campaign, a national organization that fights for the rights of gays and lesbians, has targeted U.S. Rep. Vern Buchanan, R-Fla., for his statements on the Defense of Marriage Act. In a mailer, Buchanan said that "the Obama administration recently announced it will no longer enforce the Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA), the federal law defining marriage as the union of a man and a woman." The Human Rights Campaign said that was wrong. "While President Obama announced last year that his administration believed the law to be unconstitutional and could not continue to defend it in court, he also made clear that the law would continue to be enforced unless struck down or repealed," said the HRC. The act, signed into law by President Bill Clinton in 1996, says states do not have to recognize same-sex marriages performed in other states, and that the federal government does not recognize same-sex marriage. Obama promised to repeal DOMA during his 2008 campaign. The HRC sent a press release on March 14, 2012, claiming that a Buchanan mailer mischaracterized the status of DOMA. The HRC said they received the mailer recently, but staff at Buchanan’s office told us the mailer was a year old. They also said Buchanan, who represents the Sarasota area, stood by the statements. Was Buchanan correct to state that the Obama administration recently announced it would no longer enforce DOMA, or was he wrong, as the HRC suggested? DOMA status In February 2011, Attorney General Eric Holder sent a letter to House Speaker John Boehner saying that the Obama administration would no longer defend the law -- in court. Holder argued that the law, as applied to same-sex couples legally married under state law, violates the equal protection component of the Fifth Amendment. While the letter stated that the Obama administration would not defend the law in two cases, it also stated that it will continue to be "enforced" by the executive branch until Congress repeals it, or the courts definitively strike it down. The law will still be defended, though. A group of House leaders directed the House general counsel to defend DOMA -- the initial contract with a law firm was for $500,000 and later amended for up to $1.5 million. In response to our questions, the U.S. Department of Justice sent us a letter Holder wrote to Boehner in February 2012 related to a case in which military personnel were seeking benefits for same-sex spouses. Holder wrote that though DOMA is unconstitutional, the executive branch will continue to enforce a federal law that pertains to the military that defines spouses as opposite sex. According to the Service Members Legal Defense Network, which is working on the plaintiffs’ side, although DOJ is not defending the suit, the plaintiffs and other gay and lesbian military families are not getting the same benefits as their straight married peers. In October 2011 the department announced some benefits where members may designate beneficiaries of their choosing, regardless of sexual orientation. But Department of Defense spokeswoman Eileen Lainez said that the eligibility for a number of benefits is restricted by several statutes including DOMA. Obama has repeatedly said that his administration would no longer defend DOMA in the courts, but he distinguished between defending in the courts and enforcement during a Sept. 28, 2011, roundtable discussion with reporters. "Administratively, we can't ignore the law. DOMA is still on the books," Obama said. "What we have said is even as we enforce it, we don't support it, we think it's unconstitutional. The position that my administration has taken I think will have a significant influence on the court as it examines the constitutionality of this law." HRC gave us two examples of how DOMA remains enforced. The Internal Revenue Service will not allow legally married same-sex couples to file jointly, and the Social Security Administration will not provide survivors benefits to a surviving same-sex spouse. We confirmed this with the two agencies. On the other hand, Buchanan spokesman Max Goodman cited examples of where the administration’s announcement -- or Holder’s direct action -- influenced courts to halt deportation of illegal immigrants, which he counted as a lack of enforcement. • In March 2011, the deportation case of Monica Alcota was put on hold. Alcota overstayed her tourist visa from Argentina and married a woman in Connecticut. The couple’s attorney said the judge and government attorneys agreed to the action for several reasons, including Obama’s direction to not defend DOMA. A judge later dismissed her case. • In May 2011, Holder vacated a decision by the Board of Immigration Appeals in the case of Paul Wilson Dorman, a gay man from Ireland cleared for deportation after the judges ruled against the man on the basis of DOMA. Holder asked the board to determine whether the man, who had a civil union in New Jersey, could be considered a spouse under New Jersey law. The case remains pending. • An immigration judge in Newark suspended a deportation in the case of Henry Velandia in May 2011 citing the action that Holder took in the Dorman case. Velandia, from Venezuela, had married a man in Connecticut. Immigrations and Customs Enforcement later decided that it would no longer pursue deportation. Buchanan’s office also pointed to comments made by constitutional scholars such as Ed Whelan, who worked for the U.S. Department of Justice from 2001 to 2004. Whelan testified about DOMA before the House in 2011 and is now the president of the Ethics and Public Policy Center, a conservative think tank. "The executive branch’s defense of a law in court is an essential part of enforcement, not something separate from enforcement," Whelan told PolitiFact in an email. "Might it have been better if Rep. Buchanan’s statement had said: ‘The Obama administration recently announced that it would no longer enforce in court the Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA), the federal law defining marriage as between a man and a woman’? Perhaps. But as this tweak illustrates, there is no problem with his use of the word ‘enforce’ (rather than ‘defend’)." We decided to run the statement by a few other legal experts not involved in the cases Even though the president takes an oath to support the Constitution, the president can take a position on whether a particular statute is unconstitutional, said Stephen Schnably, a constitutional law professor at University of Miami. If he finds that it is unconstitutional, there’s an argument that the president’s duty bars him from defending it in court. DOMA raises the unanswered question of whether Obama and his administration have the legal right to choose which of Congress’ laws they defend and which ones they don’t -- a question before the U.S. Supreme Court in a separate case, said Bob Jarvis, a constitutional law professor at Nova Southeastern University. "One could certainly say that any failure to compel obedience to DOMA is a failure to enforce it," Jarvis said via email. "On the other hand, one could also say that a failure to defend a law in court is different from a failure to enforce it in everyday life." Peter Edelman, a constitutional law professor at Georgetown, said there’s a difference between deciding not to defend the constitutionality of a law and failing to enforce it. "It is a significant step in and of itself, but it is not the same as not enforcing the law," he said. Our ruling Buchanan said in a mailer that the Obama administration "would no longer enforce the Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA)." The Obama administration said in February 2011 it would no longer defend the law in the courts. But the HRC cites examples that enforcement continues -- for example, gay couples can’t file their taxes jointly. We found legal experts who made arguments on both sides about whether not defending DOMA in the courts equals not enforcing it. If Buchanan had said that Obama would no longer "defend" DOMA he’d be on safe ground, but he chose "enforce" instead. The Obama administration is enforcing the law to some extent, such as forbidding joint tax returns or survivors’ benefits in Social Security for gay couples. Still, there’s clear evidence that the Obama administration is seeking to mitigate the law’s effects. We rate this claim Half True.

pomt-02909	In 1929, the Secretary of State shut down a program that was "collecting information to protect America" because it was "unseemly," but that move led to "millions and millions" of deaths in World War II.	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2013/nov/04/mike-rogers/rep-mike-rogers-says-us-shuttering-intelligence-op/	The debate over the federal government’s surveillance policies -- prompted by the release of National Security Agency documents taken by leaker Edward Snowden -- has revived interest in a decades-old tale of spycraft. The story of the "American Black Chamber" intelligence program came up during an interview with House Intelligence chairman Mike Rogers, R-Mich., on the Nov. 3, 2013, edition of CBS’ Face the Nation. Amid a discussion of whether the United States had been wrong to spy on friendly foreign leaders such as German Chancellor Angela Merkel, Rogers stood up for an aggressive American intelligence effort overseas. "We did this in the 1930s," Rogers said. "We turned it off. In 1929, the Secretary of State at that time, (when) they were collecting information to protect America, said, ‘You know, we shouldn't do this. This is unseemly.’ They turned it off. Well, that led to a whole bunch of misunderstanding that led to World War II, that killed millions and millions of people." We had two questions about Rogers’ claim. First, was he accurate in describing the history of this early United States intelligence effort? And second, is it reasonable to argue that the elimination of such a program led to "millions and millions" of deaths in World War II? The "American Black Chamber" This part of the story begins with Herbert O. Yardley (1889-1958), an Indiana native who became a code clerk with the State Department and later served during World War I in the cryptologic section of military intelligence. He parlayed that experience into what is generally considered the United States’ first peacetime code-breaking operation -- a joint project of the Army and the State Department. Using a shell company office in Manhattan, cryptoanalysts toiled behind a locked door, breaking foreign codes used in telegrams. During its dozen years of operation, the office cracked the codes of 45,000 telegrams, including messages sent by at least 19 nations, both allies (England and France) and rivals (Germany, Japan and the Soviet Union), according to David Kahn’s landmark 1996 history, The Codebreakers: The Comprehensive History of Secret Communication from Ancient Times to the Internet. In 1921 and 1922, the office figured out the codes used by Japanese negotiators at an international naval conference in Washington, providing internal Japanese bargaining positions to chief negotiator Charles Evans Hughes. Their work made it possible for the United States to secure an advantageous outcome. But by the late 1920s, the project began to fall out of favor. Congress was reluctant to provide more funding, while telegraph company executives were increasingly uncomfortable diverting telegrams. (This part of the story offers an eerie parallel to the unease expressed by Google and other companies to customer data traffic being surveilled by the NSA.) For Yardley, a new source of turbulence emerged when Herbert Hoover became president in 1929. Listening to Hoover’s first speech as president from a speakeasy, Yardley could sense that the administration’s goal of following high ethical standards would pose a serious challenge to his office. He was right. In a bid to pre-empt any change to his program, Yardley waited until Secretary of State Henry L. Stimson had been in office for a few months -- banking that Stimson had "lost some of his innocence is wrestling with the hardheaded realities of diplomacy," as Kahn put it -- and then presented him with some important code-breaking results. The tactic had worked with previous Cabinet officials, but this time, it backfired. Stimson, Kahn writes, "was shocked to learn of the existence of the Black Chamber, and totally disapproved of it. He regarded it as a low, snooping activity, a sneaking, spying, keyhole-peering kind of dirty business, a violation of the principle of mutual trust upon which he conducted both his personal affairs and his foreign policy. ... Stimson rejected the view that such means justified even patriotic ends (and) said later, 'Gentlemen do not read each other's mail.' In an act of pure moral courage, Stimson, affirming principle over expediency, withdrew all State Department funds, (and) since these constituted its major income, their loss shuttered the office." We interviewed several scholars of intelligence and all agreed that on the basic facts of the Black Chamber, Rogers was essentially right -- the who (the Secretary of State), the when (1929) and the why (that such surveillance was ungentlemanly). The only objection we heard is that while the Hoover administration shut down the Black Chamber, it did not shut down all such intelligence activities. The Army Signal Corps, under the leadership of William Friedman, continued to produce intelligence. Before we move on to the second part of Rogers’ quote, we’ll provide a brief postscript about the key players. Yardley was initially ostracized when his shop closed down, never working again for the U.S. government (though he consulted with such foreign countries as Canada and China). He did, however, get a revenge of sorts by publishing a book, The American Black Chamber, that became a financial and critical success. To this day, it remains a classic of the cryptologic literary genre. Meanwhile, the highly ethical Hoover administration proceeded to "lie straightforwardly" (Kahn’s words) by denying, in no uncertain terms, the existence of the Black Chamber, even when confronted with Yardley’s book. And Stimson? As peacetime morphed into World War II, he changed his tune. As President Franklin D. Roosevelt’s Secretary of War, Stimson received intelligence from MAGIC, a highly classified codebreaking effort run by divisions of the Army and Navy. Did the shuttering of the Black Chamber lead the United States to World War II While Rogers’ description of the Black Chamber is generally accurate, our experts said, his suggestion that its absence led to World War II is, at the very least, greatly exaggerated. Richard Breitman, an American University scholar of the World War II era, acknowledged that the closure of Yardley’s office "undoubtedly hindered American intelligence collection during the 1930s," but he added that "connecting this with the outbreak of World War II, which began in Europe without U.S. participation, is way off." Breitman noted that "there was plenty of public information, including Hitler's Mein Kampf, about Nazi Germany's general inclination to go to war," he said. In addition, "various western diplomats reported specific details from Berlin and elsewhere about Nazi plans. But Congress had limited the Roosevelt Administration's capacity to react with the Neutrality Acts." Joseph Wippl, a professor of the practice of international relations at Boston University, also points to the broader push in the United States toward neutrality, arguing that the disbanding of the Black Chamber was a symptom of a more general disengagement the nation was undergoing at the time. "After World War I, the United States returned to a policy of isolationism, in spite of the fact we were the world's dominant power," he said. "The fact that we did not have military or intelligence capability before World War II reflects what happened to the United States after World War I -- that is, back to isolationism." John Pike, the director of globalsecurity.org, said that after spending "nearly half a century studying World War II, only in recent years have I come to think I have some understanding of the thing. To me, (Rogers’) is a novel proposition. There were certainly many intelligence failures in the years before the war, but they were mainly failures of imagination, not collection." Our ruling Rogers said that in 1929, the Secretary of State shut down a program that was "collecting information to protect America" because it was "unseemly," but that move led to "millions and millions" of deaths in World War II. He is generally correct in his description of that year’s shuttering of a pioneering codebreaking project called the Black Chamber, but historians dismiss any suggestion that the program led inexorably to the onset of World War II. At best, they say, that notion is greatly exaggerated. We rate Rogers’ statement Half True.	None	Mike Rogers	None	None	None	2013-11-04T18:33:57	2013-11-03	['United_States', 'World_War_II']
pomt-12195	"More than 15,000 transgender Americans" are "serving in the military today."	half-true	/wisconsin/statements/2017/jul/26/mark-pocan/how-many-people-military-are-transgender/	An announcement by President Donald Trump on Twitter that the U.S. government "will not accept or allow transgender individuals to serve in any capacity in the U.S. military" drew an almost immediate denunciation from U.S. Rep. Mark Pocan. The Madison-area Democrat called the decision "outrageous and shameful" and "based in discrimination" in a news release issued July 26, 2017. He concluded by stating: "With more than 15,000 transgender Americans serving in the military today, President Trump should immediately reverse course on his decision and he should stop using shocking policy shifts on Twitter to distract Americans from his failing health care plan." Given that the issue of transgender troops may be unfamiliar to many readers, we thought we’d check Pocan’s claim that more than 15,000 are serving in the military. No official data The Pentagon has said it does not know how many transgender people serve in uniform because until 2016, they faced discharge if they revealed their identities. A Pentagon spokesman did not reply when we asked if the the Pentagon has any estimates. The U.S. Census Bureau also does not collect data on sexual orientation or gender identity. (In April 2016, more than 75 members of Congress wrote to the Census Bureau to request the addition of sexual orientation and gender identity as a subject for the bureau’s regular American Community Survey. The bureau concluded, according to a March 2017 memo, that "there was no federal data need" to include those.) So, there are no official statistics on the number of transgender people in the military. That leaves us with two prominently cited studies that produced estimates which vary. 2014 study To support Pocan’s statement, his office referred us to a 2014 report by UCLA Law School’s Williams Institute on Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity Law and Public Policy. (The Human Rights Campaign and the National Center for Transgender Equality pointed us to the same study.) That study estimated that 15,500 transgender individuals were serving on active duty or in the Guard or Reserve forces. The study said its primary source was a national survey done by the National Gay and Lesbian Task Force and the National Center for Transgender Equality, which the researchers said was the largest sample of transgender people in the United States available at the time. That survey was conducted over a six-month period starting in the fall of 2008. "Data that allow for a direct tabulation of the number of transgender individuals who serve in the U.S. military simply do not exist," the researchers wrote. "The estimates in this research brief rely on a variety of assumptions that could affect their accuracy." They added, however, that "the estimates certainly suggest that transgender individuals are part of the active duty U.S. armed forces, perhaps in portions that exceed that of the general population." 2016 study A 2016 study by the RAND Corp., commissioned by the Pentagon, reported lower figures than the UCLA study. The RAND researchers estimated between 1,320 and 6,630 active duty and between 830 and 4,160 in the reserves. That would be a total of between 2,150 and 10,790 transgender service members, based on figures for people serving in the military in 2014. The study said the estimate was derived from data from multiple surveys. And the reseachers noted: "It is important to note that there have been no rigorous epidemiological studies of the size" of the U.S. transgender population, including those who serve in the military. Asked about the difference between the two studies, Pocan’s spokesman told us: "Whenever we have multiple studies, we try to take the more inclusive one." Our rating Pocan said: "More than 15,000 transgender Americans" are "serving in the military today." A UCLA study estimated the figure is 15,500, while a more recent study by the RAND Corp. estimated 2,150 to 10,790. There are no official counts, so Pocan goes too far in flatly stating his figure. But his figure matches one of two prominently cited estimates. We rate the statement Half True.

pomt-10315	On offshore drilling.	half flip	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/aug/04/john-mccain/mccains-cheerleading-for-drilling-is-new/	In an interview with the News-Leader in Springfield, Mo., on June 18, 2008, Sen. John McCain was asked about his recent push for offshore oil drilling. "You have changed your thoughts on that, am I correct?" "No," McCain said. "I've always said it's up to the states and I still say that." The interview came a day after McCain's headline-making speech in Houston in which he made a pitch for lifting a federal moratorium on offshore drilling. So McCain says it's not a switch, but is it? We wanted to find out if he has consistently said it's up to the individual states to decide whether to drill off their coasts. Here's the rest of McCain's answer to the question: "But if the states want to drill offshore, and I hope they do. ... Gasoline prices have gone from a buck and a quarter to four dollars and it's even going to go higher, according to some. I think we have to explore all of the options that we have, and review them. "And I think offshore oil exploration and natural gas exploration is a good thing to do. But the states would still make the decision." Opponents have said McCain was once a proponent of the federal moratorium on offshore drilling. But McCain's record is not so clear. About the closest we could come to finding an inconsistency in McCain's position was two newspaper articles from the presidential race in 1999 — one from the San Francisco Chronicle, the other from the Ventura County (Calif.) Star — in which the reporters paraphrase McCain's position as supporting the moratorium on offshore drilling. In 2000, the Associated Press listed McCain's position on offshore drilling as "Supports state wishes over federal fiat in oil drilling." Here's a sampling of McCain quotes about offshore drilling, starting with ones made when he ran for president in 2000. • "Ronald Reagan believed ... that states should have enormous input into the decisions that directly concern them. This directly concerns the people of California, this decision on offshore oil drilling. Now, off of this coast of Texas, I understand Texans want offshore oil drilling. That's fine with me. Off Florida, they don't. I think that we should allow these decisions, to some degree to be made — significant degree to be made by the people who are directly affected by them." McCain during an interview on ABC News' This Week, Feb. 27, 2000. • "The leases for offshore oil drilling should never have been granted without allowing Californians a legitimate voice in the decisionmaking process. I believe it is up to the voters of California to determine the fate of these leases, and as president, I will respect the decision they make regarding the leases. The people of California deserve to be heard, without being forced to resort to legal action against their own government. As president, I will see to it that the interests of the people of California rise above the special interests of Washington." McCain to the Associated Press in March 2000. • "I wouldn't drill off the coast of Florida unless the people of Florida wanted to. And I wouldn't drill off the coast of California unless the people of California wanted to. And I wouldn't drill in the Grand Canyon unless the people in Arizona wanted to." McCain during a Republican presidential debate in Dearborn, Mich., Oct. 9, 2007. • "Look, I'm a federalist, and I believe the states should decide to enormous degrees what happens within those states, including off their coasts. The people of California have decided they don't want oil drilling off their coasts. The people of Louisiana have decided that they do." McCain during a Republican presidential debate in Simi Valley, Calif., on Jan. 30, 2008. Here's what McCain said in Houston on June 17, 2008: "With gasoline running at more than four bucks a gallon, many do not have the luxury of waiting on the far-off plans of futurists and politicians. We have proven oil reserves of at least 21-billion barrels in the United States. But a broad federal moratorium stands in the way of energy exploration and production. And I believe it is time for the federal government to lift these restrictions and to put our own reserves to use. "We can do this in ways that are consistent with sensible standards of environmental protection. And in states that choose to permit exploration, there must be an appropriate sharing of benefits between federal and state governments. But as a matter of fairness to the American people, and a matter of duty for our government, we must deal with the here and now, and assure affordable fuel for America by increasing domestic production." We should note one anomaly in McCain's position. Unlike many of his Republican counterparts in the Senate, McCain has long been opposed to drilling in Alaska's Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, even though most Alaska residents support it. In Houston, McCain explained why ANWR is a special case. "Quite rightly, I believe, we confer a special status on some areas of our country that are best left undisturbed," McCain said. "When America set aside the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, we called it a 'refuge' for a reason." As for McCain's voting record on offshore drilling, it's a bit mixed. In June 2003, McCain was among 10 Republicans who voted for an amendment proposed by Democratic Florida Sen. Bob Graham that would have called off a survey and inventory of possible offshore oil and natural gas deposits. It failed. In August 2006, McCain voted in favor of a bill that authorized drilling in about 8.3-million acres of the eastern Gulf of Mexico, off the coasts of Alabama, Louisiana, Mississippi and Texas. The bill, which passed handily, also established a 125-mile buffer until 2022 for energy development in Gulf waters off the Florida coast, and extended the moratorium on energy exploration and development in the Gulf from 2012 to 2022. As for ANWR, McCain voted yes on a 2006 procedural measure that protected legislation opening up the Arctic refuge; but he voted for an amendment to strike language that would have done the same in the previous year's budget resolution. Nowhere in those previously listed interviews or speeches prior to Houston does McCain actively advocate for states to institute offshore drilling. Nor does he talk about creating incentives to encourage them to do it, as he did in Houston. That's why the speech made for front-page headlines. Yes, McCain has long been in favor of letting states ultimately decide whether to drill, but he's now become a cheerleader for the cause. If it's not a change in position, it's at least a change in posture. So we rate McCain's position a Half Flip.	None	John McCain	None	None	None	2008-08-04T00:00:00	2008-08-04	['None']

"We’ve gone from paying about $100 for EpiPens to over $600. And they only hold about one dollar’s worth of medicine," the Aug. 29, 2017, video says. "We don’t have a choice but to pay it and the drug companies know it. Vote yes on Issue 2, the Drug Price Relief Act." Do EpiPens really cost that much, and could their price go down with an up-vote on the ballot initiative? Prescription drugs may be severely overpriced, but the ad misrepresents the bill’s impact. And strangely, its example of EpiPens doesn’t really apply to the population that the group is trying to help. Issue 2 is a ballot initiative up for a vote on Nov. 7. If approved, it would require all drugs bought by the state -- whether for Medicaid or other state programs -- to match Veterans Affairs prices, which receive a 24 percent discount off market price in addition to sometimes undisclosed rebates. The idea is that it would lower the state’s health care costs. The ad has a point that the price for the EpiPen two-pack soared since 2007, from $94 to $609. Each pen holds about one dollar’s worth of the drug epinephrine. While the ad makes it sound as though there is no alternative, Mylan released a $300 generic EpiPen two-pack in December 2016 and Lineage Therapeutics offers a generic auto-injector for $110. That’s still a lot, but it’s less than the $600 the ad mentions. The ad also misrepresents the population the initiative would aid, as approximately 70 percent of EpiPen users are privately insured, and Medicaid patients already pay nothing out of pocket, according to Brittany Warner, an Ohio Medicaid spokeswoman. And even if the ad was referring to the prices paid by the state, instead of patients, Medicaid already enjoys significant discounts. Brand EpiPen 2-pak’s listed price for the Medicaid program is $291.41, but because it doesn’t include rebates (which remain confidential), it may be lower. The VA price is indeed lower: $182.33, which includes rebates. "They’re trying to appeal to the sense of outrage of high drug prices, especially for things that ought to be covered for free, but it’s a weird example to cite in the context of this particular initiative, as the vast majority of people who use it are privately insured," said Kao-Ping Chua, a health policy researcher at the University of Chicago who co-authored a study of out-of-pocket spending on EpiPens. Chua said the privately insured and the uninsured bore the greatest brunt of the price increase, though the price they faced for the injectors varied depending on the type of plan they are on. According to Julie Knell, a spokeswoman for Mylan, the company that sells EpiPens, "nearly 90 percent of consumers who received EpiPen Auto-Injector or its authorized generic had an out-of-pocket cost of less than $100 and more than 80 percent are paying less than $50." "I would still argue that $100 is a lot to pay for a life-saving medication," Chua said. "This is the difference between life and death." In addition to the Medicaid program, the state purchases drugs for state employees, prisons, and other state-run programs, but the campaign was unable to pin down the effect of the initiative on these groups. Dennis Willard, a campaign spokesman, said 4 million Ohioans would be affected, 2.8 million of whom are on Medicaid or CHIP. Rachel Sachs, a professor at Washington University in St. Louis School of Law, told us that if the initiative worked (she identified various legal issues with it in a blog post), the biggest impact would be felt by state correctional systems, which go unmentioned in the ad. Chua warned that if lowering the price for the privately insured was the goal of Issue 2, this wasn’t the best way forward, as companies could raise costs for private insurers to make up for lost revenue from states like Ohio. Opposition ads make a similar argument, claiming VA prices could also increase in response to the act. Researchers Thomas J. Hwang and Aaron S. Kesselheim evaluated this question when the group proposed a similar initiative in California. (It didn’t pass.) They said that the long-term budgetary effect of the ballot initiative was uncertain. A review claiming causation between a similar 1990 measure and increased VA prices couldn’t be "credibly established," they said. Sachs said that restricting the price pharmaceutical companies can demand from the state of Ohio shouldn’t affect the price they offer private insurers or the VA. That’s because price discrimination makes it so that pharmaceuticals arrange different prices with each market, and there’s no reason to believe they haven’t already struck the best deal possible in each one. While studies suggest cost-shifting, or the displacement of costs on other markets, has little impact on hospitals, Sachs admits there’s insufficient research on this phenomenon in the pharmaceutical industry. In the absence of research on the impact of similar initiatives elsewhere, Gerard Anderson, a professor at Johns Hopkins University's Bloomberg School of Public Health, said it would be difficult to gauge the proposal’s impact on the privately insured. Our ruling A pro-Issue 2 ad in Ohio claimed, "We’ve gone from paying about $100 for Epipens to over $600. And they only hold about one dollar’s worth of medicine. We don’t have a choice but to pay it and the drug companies know it." There is a key difference in the "we" paying $600 -- a relatively small fraction of the privately insured population -- and the population for whom the initiative plans to lower prices. The majority of those covered by state-sponsored insurance, like Medicaid, already pay a $0 co-pay. The campaign didn’t provide evidence of the impact on other state-insured populations, though it could have a significant impact on the smaller prison population, which does not face the same rebates as the Medicaid program. The ballot initiative would have no formal effect on prices for the privately insured, and the trickle-down effect for market prices remains speculative. We rate this claim Mostly False.

pomt-06559	Says Gov. Chris Christie has "now come up with a new agenda" for ethics reform in September 2011.	mostly false	/new-jersey/statements/2011/oct/03/john-wisniewski/john-wisniewski-claims-chris-christies-ethics-refo/	Gov. Chris Christie has been promoting his ethics reform package for more than a year, but that message apparently never reached the ears of Assemblyman John Wisniewski (D-Middlesex) until this past month. Wisniewski, chairman of the state Democratic Party, claimed in a Sept. 26 interview on NJToday that Christie was silent on the subject of ethics reform until coming up with a new agenda in September. "The governor has this urgent ethics reform package. So when we met as a body in the Legislature in June, the governor was silent, and in July, the governor said nothing. And in August, the governor was traveling to meet with the Koch brothers (Charles and David Koch)," Wisniewski told anchor Mike Schneider. "And finally, in September, he’s now come up with a new agenda and he’s talking about an issue – he’s accusing legislators, accusing me, of not disclosing where we earn our income. Every year, we file a financial disclosure report." Does the governor’s ethics reform package represent "a new agenda"? It didn’t take long for PolitiFact New Jersey to determine Wisniewski was off with that claim. The package took a backseat over the summer -- when officials were debating pension and health benefits reform, and the state budget -- but Christie first unveiled his ethics reform proposals a year ago. "This really has been on the agenda for over a year," said Brigid Harrison, a political science professor at Montclair State University. Wisniewski told us he stands by his statement. Even if Christie spoke about ethics reform in the past, that has not been his agenda, Wisniewski said. "It’s not been what he’s talking about," Wisniewski said. Let’s explain how long Christie has been discussing ethics reform. In September 2010, Christie proposed a series of ethics reform measures, such as having a more detailed financial disclosure statement for the legislative branch, and a complete ban on dual office holding. By April 2011, the governor was still talking about how he had proposed an ethics reform package in September, but none of his proposals had received a hearing in the Democratic-controlled Legislature. At an April 26 town hall meeting, Christie said, on the subject of ethics reform, the Legislature’s report card would read, "demonstrates a complete disinterest in the subject matter." In the months following those remarks, ethics reform would fall into the shadows behind pension and health benefits reform and, soon after that, a showdown over the new state budget. In August, much public attention focused on proposed toll hikes and then Hurricane Irene. By September -- with Election Day on the horizon -- Christie renewed his focus during recent town hall meetings on ethics reform. David Redlawsk, a political science professor in the Eagleton Institute of Politics at Rutgers University, said it’s incorrect to claim ethics reform represents a new topic for Christie, but he agreed that the proposals fell off the radar after being unveiled last year. "He made the proposals, but he never did what was necessary to push them hard," Redlawsk said. "He turned to other parts of his agenda." Before we turn to our ruling, let’s talk about the financial disclosure report cited by Wisniewski in the television interview. Wisniewski and other legislators are required to file financial disclosure statements by May 15, detailing sources of income and other data from the preceding calendar year. For each source of income, legislators must show the range of their earnings according to four categories, with the highest level listed as $50,000 or more. "Nobody’s hiding anything and it’s outright false to suggest otherwise," Wisniewski told us. In his most recent report, Wisniewski listed his sources of earned income as what he receives through his law firm and through his legislative salary. But the financial disclosure statements submitted by Christie and other designated state officials provide greater detail of income earnings. Those forms outline seven categories with the highest level identified as greater than $500,000. Our ruling Wisniewski claimed Christie had "come up with a new agenda" for ethics reform this past month. But the governor unveiled his ethics reform proposals a year ago, and reiterated the need for action earlier this year. Still, Wisniewski is right that ethics reform has not been the governor’s top priority in recent months. We rate the statement Mostly False. To comment on this ruling, go to NJ.com.

pomt-06531	"Legally, it doesn't make any difference" which state district you live in when running for Congress.	true	/rhode-island/statements/2011/oct/07/brian-newberry/house-minority-leader-brian-newberry-says-congress/	Want to run for Congress? Are you facing a bruising election battle in the district where you vote? Here's a solution: run in another district. And don’t worry, you don’t even need to move to the new district. Brian Newberry, a Republican and the minority leader in Rhode Island's House, raised the concept during an interview on WPRI-TV's "Newsmakers" broadcast Oct. 2, 2011. He was talking about the campaign for the Congressional District 1 seat now held by Democrat David Cicilline. In 2010, Republican John J. Loughlin II, a former Tiverton state representative, almost beat Cicilline, getting 44.6 percent of the vote. Loughlin is itching for a rematch. But former state police Supt. Brendan Doherty also is running for the seat as a Republican. Newberry is afraid a GOP primary between Loughlin and Doherty would be divisive and help Cicilline win reelection in 2012. So Newberry has suggested that, instead, Doherty run in Rhode Island's 2nd Congressional District against incumbent Democrat James Langevin. But Doherty, whose residence is in Cumberland, doesn't live in that district. "Legally it doesn't make any difference," Newberry said. That may come as a shock to some people. Voting outside your district is a felony, and people are periodically arrested for the crime. Even if you own a business in a community, which gives you a big stake in local politics, you can't vote there unless your actual residence is there. And it's illegal to run for any state or local office unless your primary residence is in the district. But it's OK to run for Congress outside your district? It is, as long as the district is in your state. "The U.S. Constitution does not require candidates for the U.S. House of Representatives to live in the district they wish to represent," said Chris Barnett, spokesman for Secretary of State A. Ralph Mollis. It sets three requirements. "You must be at least 25 years old, must have been a U.S. citizen for at least the past seven years, and must live in the state you want to represent." Article I Section 2 of the founding document says nothing about being an "inhabitant" (to use the original wording) of the specific district where you are running. In addition, you don't even have to move into the state until the day before election day. And because states cannot pass laws that supersede the U.S. Constitution, no further restrictions would be permitted without a constitutional amendment. (The last time this issue came up in Rhode Island was in 1995 when then-Lt. Gov. Robert Weygand decided to run for Congress in the 2nd District while he was living in East Providence, in the 1st District. While there was no legal requirement that he move to the 2nd District, he ultimately did so, closing a deal on a home in North Kingstown on the same day he officially declared his candidacy.) State and local elections are different. Because the U.S. Constitution is silent on such matters, the states are free to require that people running for office actually live among the people they are seeking to represent. So running for either of Rhode Island's two House seats can be done by any Rhode Island resident. Where you live in the state doesn't make a difference, as Newberry said. We rate his statement True.

pomt-04407	Says Mitt Romney refused to say whether he'd sign the Lilly Ledbetter bill.	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/oct/16/barack-obama/obama-mitt-romney-refused-say-whether-he-supports-/	Updated Thursday, October 25th, 2012 at 2:08 p.m. Asked about fair pay for women during the second presidential debate, President Barack Obama was quick to bring up the first piece of legislation he signed into law -- the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act. Audience member Katherine Fenton asked Obama, "In what new ways to you intend to rectify the inequalities in the workplace, specifically regarding females making only 72 percent of what their male counterparts earn?" Obama talked about being raised by a single mom who put herself through school and of his grandmother, who worked her way up from a bank secretary to a vice president but "hit the glass ceiling." "She trained people who would end up becoming her bosses during the course of her career. She didn't complain. That's not what you did in that generation," he said at the debate at Hofstra University on Oct. 16, 2012. "And this is one of the reasons why one of the first -- the first bill I signed was something called the Lilly Ledbetter bill." Romney responded by saying at one point he had more women in senior leadership positions than any other governor and that he wanted to help more women find jobs. Obama jumped in, saying, "Katherine, I just want to point out that when Gov. Romney's campaign was asked about the Lilly Ledbetter bill, whether he supported it, he said, ‘I'll get back to you.’ And that's not the kind of advocacy that women need in any economy." Did Romney and his campaign really refuse to say whether he supported the law? Sort of. The law, which Obama signed on Jan. 29, 2009, made it easier for workers to pursue wage discrimination claims but received little Republican support in Congress. It updated 1960s civil rights and age discrimination laws to reset the statute of limitations on such claims with each new paycheck. In 2007, the Supreme Court had ruled in Ledbetter vs. Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co. that the 180-day statute of limitations started from the day an employer made the decision to discriminate — making it harder for employees who claimed such discrimination later to get relief, such as back pay. What did Romney have to say about it? For a previous fact-check in May, the Obama campaign directed us to a couple media reports. In an April 2012 conference call covered by a Washington Post blogger, a Huffington Post reporter asked an unnamed Romney adviser whether Romney supported the Lilly Ledbetter Act. The adviser responded, "Sam (Stein), we’ll get back to you on that." Later, Romney spokeswoman Andrea Saul clarified in an email, "He supports pay equity and is not looking to change current law." The second piece the Obama campaign showed us was a Romney interview by Diane Sawyer of ABC News. Sawyer asked Romney, " If you were president — you had been president — would you have signed the Lilly Ledbetter Law?" Romney’s response: Romney: "It's certainly a piece of legislation I have no intention of changing. I wasn't there three years ago —" Sawyer: "But would you have signed it?" Romney: "... I'm not going to go back and look at all the prior laws and say had I been there which ones would I have supported and signed, but I certainly support equal pay for women and — and have no intention of changing that law, don't think there's a reason to." Here, Romney did refuse to say whether he would have signed the bill into law. But he also said he has "no intention of changing that law." Our ruling Obama said that when asked whether he would have signed the Lilly Ledbetter Act into law, Romney's campaign said, "I'll get back to you." His point was that the campaign was dodging the question. Indeed, a Romney adviser did say earlier this year that he would "get back" to a reporter about whether he supported the Lilly Ledbetter Act. A spokeswoman then said he would not change it, and Romney later said he "certainly support(s) equal pay for women," and has "no intention of changing that law." So Obama is correct about the initial statement, but Romney later clarified by saying he wouldn't change the law. We rate Obama's claim Mostly True. CORRECTION: A previous version of this item said the Supreme Court's Ledbetter decision made it "impossible for employees who learned of such discrimination later to get relief, such as back pay." In fact, the court declined to address the question of whether employees who learned of discrimination after the statute of limitations expired would be protected under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.

pomt-09432	Says the Texas State Board of Education is considering eliminating references to Christmas and the Constitution in textbooks.	pants on fire!	/texas/statements/2010/mar/12/gretchen-carlson/gretchen-carlson-says-state-board-education-consid/	After spending most of Wednesday gathering public comment, the Texas State Board of Education began hashing out how history, government and economics are taught in Texas public schools. The board's efforts to revise social studies curriculum standards had drawn national attention, from the Fox News Channel in particular. On Wednesday morning's broadcast of "Fox & Friends," co-anchor Gretchen Carlson sounded scandalized by what the network dubbed the "Texas Textbook Wars." "Stage set for a bitter debate — the Texas Board of Education begins hearings today on proposed changes to textbooks that could change what students across the country learn," she said. "About history!" Addressing Jason Moore, a Texas parent who planned to speak at Wednesday's hearing, Carlson said: "So, one of the proposed changes, Jason, is actually to start history class in the year 1877, which would be a big problem for a lot of people, would it not? And eliminate references to certain holidays, Founding Fathers, the Constitution! I mean, no surprise that Christmas, they want to get rid of that because they've been doing that for the last couple of years, but c'mon, the Constitution?" Come again — we the people will not study the Constitution in school? Christmas nearly kaput? Moore corrected Carlson on one count — he said the board had made clear that it's not considering eliminating references to the Christian holiday. Carlson didn't acknowledge her goof. The Texas Education Agency, which oversees primary and secondary education, blasted Fox News for distorting the facts. "The Fox Network in recent days has repeatedly broadcast highly inaccurate information about the State Board of Education’s efforts to adopt the new social studies curriculum standards," the agency said in a press release. On Thursday, "Fox & Friends" co-anchor Steve Doocy backpedaled on his colleague's earlier statement. According to a Fox News transcript, Doocy said on the show: "I just want to clarify some stuff, a couple of points. First of all, they were upset that what we said that what they are doing down in Texas is they are developing standards for new textbooks. Technically, what they are doing is they are developing curriculum standards that will set what is taught in classes, and then those standards will become part of a framework that textbooks are based on. We were just trying to make it simpler… "Also," Doocy said, "we talked about a suggestion that was made that history is, American history starts in the year 1877. That was a suggestion, made first of all, in North Carolina, and we thought we were pretty clear that these were just suggestions, and there have been a lot of suggestions, regarding the founding fathers, and some different dates that may or may not be included in the text . . . . We want to make sure you understand, they were just suggestions, and that is our clarification." So Fox admits it erred on what the Texas board is debating: curriculum standards, not textbook content. Now, what about those Christmas and Constitution deletions Carlson bemoaned? Let's start with the Christmas brouhaha, which broke out last summer. In standards under revision for sixth-grade world culture courses, the board's Texas Essential Knowledge and Skills review committee recommended replacing Christmas and Rosh Hashanah with the Buddhist and Hindu holiday Diwali as examples of significant religious holidays. Here's the wording of the committee's proposed July revision with deletions in parentheses: "Culture. The student understands the relationships among religion, philosophy, and culture. The student is expected to a) explain the relationship among religious ideas, philosophical ideas, and cultures; and b) explain the significance of religious holidays and observances such as (Christmas and) Easter, Ramadan, (and) Yom Kippur (and Rosh Hashanah) Diwali in (selected) various contemporary societies." Critics immediately called the proposed changes "the war on Christmas." When the board met in September, it made clear that those holidays would be put back in — and they were restored in the committee's October revision. Upshot: The board isn't considering removing Christmas from the list of holiday examples. What about starting the teaching of American history in 1877, leaving out the drafting of the Constitution in 1787 and decades of events after that? Doocy said on "Fox & Friends" that Carlson was referring to suggestions in North Carolina. He didn't elaborate on why his colleague referred to the Tar Heel State while talking about Texas. We confirmed that while updating its curriculum standards, North Carolina's education board came under fire for a proposed change to spread its teaching of history over several grades so that high school juniors would only study U.S. history post-Reconstruction, after 1877. Currently in that state, U.S history after 1789 is taught in high school. Texas has long spread its teaching of history over several grades. The Texas Education Agency said: "Texas has and always will teach U.S. History from the beginning until present day. U.S. History through Reconstruction is taught in eighth grade... U.S. history since 1877 is taught in 11th grade." We found eight references to the Constitution in the proposed revisions to the high school standard, and more than 20 in both the draft middle school and elementary school standards. Nothing is final yet — the board is expected to give final approval to the standards in May. So let's review. First, the board is hammering out changes to state curriculum standards, not textbooks. Second, the board is not considering removing Christmas from a list of various religious holidays. And third, the board has never considered removing the Constitution from history textbooks or the state's curriculum. The "Fox & Friends" anchor made things simple and irresponsibly far-fetched and wrong. We rate Carlson's ridiculous statement as Pants on Fire.

pomt-05417	The fastest-rising expense in the U.S. Defense Department is health care.	true	/georgia/statements/2012/may/02/saxby-chambliss/senators-claim-military-health-care-costs-going-hi/	U.S. Sen. Saxby Chambliss has been going around the Atlanta region in recent weeks talking about the dangerous consequences of the federal government’s inability to rein in spending. One area of spending that has the Georgia Republican concerned is the U.S. Defense Department’s health care budget. We thought one claim by the senator was a case for the Truth-O-Meter. In an April 11 speech to the Marietta Rotary Club, The Marietta Daily Journal paraphrased Chambliss as saying health care costs are the fastest-rising expense in the Defense Department. "If we’re not careful, it’s going to consume our ability to buy weapons systems and to pay our men and women at the rate we need to pay them," Chambliss told the crowd in Marietta. Chambliss, who serves on the Senate’s Armed Services Committee, made a similar point in an April 23 speech at the Atlanta Press Club. "If I went around this room to every company represented here and I asked you what is the fastest-rising expense in your business over the last decade, I dare say 100 percent of you would say it’s health care costs," Chambliss said. "And it’s exactly that way in the federal government, including TRICARE in the Department of Defense, which is taking away our ability to spend money on other quality-of-life issues and identify weapons systems to equip our men and women." TRICARE is the program that provides health care to active-duty service members. Since defense is such an important part of the duties of the federal government, PolitiFact Georgia decided to examine whether the senator was correct. Bronwyn Lance Chester, a spokeswoman for Chambliss, sent us several newspaper articles and other documents to back up the senator’s claim. She did not specify the time period to which Chambliss was referring. That left us to our own interpretation. The Military Health System budget, which pays for care for nearly 10 million military members, their families, retirees, dependent survivors and some others, nearly tripled over the past decade, Defense Department officials say in their budget overview, released in February. According to the overview, spending rose from $19 billion in fiscal year 2001 to the 2012 fiscal year total of about $53 billion. That $53 billion total does not include health care costs for military operations in Iraq and Afghanistan. The federal budget year begins Oct. 1 and ends Sept. 30. We’re currently in fiscal year 2012. Multiple news accounts quote former Defense Secretary Robert Gates and other military officials as saying health care is the fastest-growing cost of the department budget. We saw nothing in that report that shows a larger increase in any department. PolitiFact Georgia also looked at the latest Defense Department budget, which was completed in March. Lance Chester referred us to Table 5-5 of the budget, known as the Green Book, which has a breakdown of spending in several categories dating back to 1970 and projected through fiscal year 2017, which would begin Oct. 1, 2016. We began by looking at the last five years. Here, the numbers were higher than what we saw in the February report. The current fiscal year spending under the health category was $100 billion. In fiscal year 2008, it was $82.74 billion. By our calculations, that was nearly a 21 percent increase over that five-year time span. That was the largest increase we saw. The second-highest increase was in fuel, which rose by 19.6 percent. In fiscal year 2017, the health portion of the Defense Department budget is projected to be $114.24 billion. Other medical costs rose by a similar percentage. Maya MacGuineas, president of the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, an organization of former federal budget officials, members of Congress and experts, is frustrated with politicians of all stripes in Washington for their failure to manage taxpayer money. We asked her if Chambliss is correct about this claim. "It’s true," said MacGuineas, who describes herself as a political independent. Defense officials are proposing to cut health care costs by increasing health care fees, copays and deductibles for retirees. Any way you slice the numbers, it appears the senator’s claim is based on some solid numbers. Health care spending was the fastest-rising cost over the most recent five years, Defense Department figures show. It is also projected to be the fastest-rising cost over the next five years. We rate this Chambliss claim as True.	None	Saxby Chambliss	None	None	None	2012-05-02T06:00:00	2012-04-11	['None']

Donald Payne and Frank Pallone have been serving in Congress for more than two decades as Democrats, but several blog posts have offered another word to describe both officials. Socialists? An Aug. 12 post on the website for a group called Sovereign Citizens United names Payne (D-10th Dist.) and Pallone (D-6th Dist.) as members of the Congressional Progressive Caucus, which it says was created by the Democratic Socialists of America. "I’m sure if you asked random people on the street if we had open socialists in the US Congress, they would say – well only Bernie Sanders (Senate). But the right answer is much, much worse," according to the post. Another post on a website called "The Obama File" mentions Payne and Pallone and claims "members of the Progressive Caucus also belong to the Democratic Socialists of America (DSA)." Here’s a blog post on Aug. 17 by Texas radio host Dan Cofall, whose show airs out of Fort Worth: "The magic number ‘70’ is the number of members of the 111th Congress who are members of the Democratic Socialists of America (DSA). These are not just politicians who vote left of center; these are card-carrying members of ‘The Democratic Socialists of America’." That blog post names Payne, but not Pallone. Cofall did not respond to an email seeking comment. While most of the names politicians are called are opinions, calling a congressman a Socialist sounds both emphatic and exact. But real card-carrying Socialists say those members, including Payne and Pallone, aren’t Socialists. The list that Cofall and dozens more rely upon "is completely fraudulent," said Frank Llewellyn, who served as national director of the Democratic Socialists of America for 10 years until stepping down July 5. There is not one member of Congress who is a formal member of the DSA, Llewellyn said. In order to join, a person must fill out a form and pay dues. Even Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, a self-described democratic socialist, is not a formal member of the DSA, Llewellyn said. The last member of Congress who was an actual card-carrying member, he said, was California Democratic Rep. Ron Dellums, who served 28 years in the House until leaving in 1998. Llewellyn and DSA’s new national director, Maria Svart are chagrined for two reasons. First, they have to spend time knocking down reports that never seem to go away. Second, Llewellyn said, "if we had formal political relationships with 70-odd members, we would be making a lot more money’’ from dues. So, Payne and Pallone have been identified as socialists for being members of the Congressional Progressive Caucus. But what is that caucus anyway? According to its website, the Progressive Caucus is one of the largest in Congress and works for such causes as economic justice, civil rights and civil liberties as well as global peace and security. Llewellyn said that DSA supports some of the policy positions of the caucus. But agreeing with some positions doesn’t make a member of Congress a card-carrying Socialist. And for the record, both Payne and Pallone reject being labeled a socialist. With so much space available on the Internet, Payne told PolitiFact New Jersey he wasn’t surprised to learn of the blog posts, but said their reasoning defies logic. Payne argued that progressive principles make the country unique and strong, allowing individuals to move between income levels. Of the "socialist" label, Payne said: "I’ve been called worse things than that." Pallone said in a written statement: "The progressive label dates back to Teddy Roosevelt and Woodrow Wilson who fought to break up the corporate monopolies and trusts that were crippling the American economy. Those ideas are just as important in our efforts to create jobs and grow the economy." The ruling Misinformation and smear campaigns are part of political life. But these persistent claims about socialists are riddled with errors and outright lies. Any one of the problems would be sufficient to discredit the report, but taken together, the effort is flagrantly false. For that reason, we rate this claim: Pants on Fire.

pomt-03908	"Property taxes had increased 70 percent in the previous 10 years."	mostly true	/new-jersey/statements/2013/feb/28/chris-christie/chris-christie-repeats-claim-about-70-percent-hike/	The years before Gov. Chris Christie became governor were just awful, with previous administrations raising property taxes by startling amounts, he suggested during Tuesday’s budget address to the Legislature. In describing the way things used to be done in New Jersey, Christie asked lawmakers and the public to recall the state’s dire financial straits as recently as four years ago. "Property taxes had increased 70 percent in the previous 10 years," Christie said, according to the text of his speech. Christie has made this claim before, first in October at a town hall meeting in West Milford. Given that New Jersey has the highest property taxes in the nation, the 70 percent jump in a decade might not seem so shocking. But we learned a couple of things: first, the increase was actually slightly higher than 70 percent, but it falls once property tax rebates are factored into the mix. Christie spokesman Michael Drewniak told PolitiFact New Jersey at the time that the 70 percent jump in taxes in the decade before the governor took office resulted from "unrestrained spending and overgenerous benefits and the expansion of government at the local and state level." Let’s look at the numbers. The average property tax bill in New Jersey was roughly $4,240 in 1999, according to data from the state Department of Community Affairs. By 2009 -- the year before Christie took office -- the average property tax bill had climbed to about $7,280. That increase amounts to more than 71 percent. Now let’s look at the issue of rebates. In previous fact-checks, experts have explained that reductions in property tax rebate programs could be viewed as tax hikes, since they’re intended to reduce property tax costs for homeowners. In 1999, when the NJ Saver program was started under former Gov. Christie Whitman, the average rebate check mailed to homeowners was $111. By 2009, the average rebate was $1,037. When those rebates are deducted from the average property tax bill, the increase over the decade before Christie took office comes in under 70 percent. In 1999, homeowners paid an average of about $4,130 in property taxes, with the rebate. In 2009, that figure jumped to roughly $6,240, an increase of more than 51 percent. Christie stopped delivering checks for property tax relief during his first year in office and changed the program so the rebate was deducted from property tax bills. In 2011, the average property tax bill was $7,759. With the credit, the average bill was $7,519. Our ruling Christie said during his budget address that "property taxes had increased 70 percent in the previous 10 years" to him becoming governor. Looking at the numbers, the average property tax bill in the 10 years before Christie took office climbed more than 70 percent, from about $4,240 to about $7,280. But the increase drops to more like 50 percent when property tax rebates are factored into the equation. Still, the overall point here is that property taxes jumped significantly in the decade before he became governor. To comment on this story, go to NJ.com.

pomt-08729	"Florida is enjoying its lowest crime rate in 39 years."	mostly true	/florida/statements/2010/sep/01/charlie-crist/crist-says-floridas-crime-rate-lower-1971/	On his campaign website for his independent bid for U.S. Senate, Gov. Charlie Crist touts public safety laws enacted during his tenure as governor including the "Anti-Murder Act" that sends violent felony offenders who violate probation back to jail, a law requiring criminals to serve at least 85 percent of their sentences, and the Jessica Lunsford Act to protect children from sex offenders. "Due to these important policies and laws, Florida is enjoying its lowest crime rate in 39 years." For this Truth-O-Meter we wanted to explore whether the state's crime rate is the lowest it has been in 39 years. We turned to the Florida Department of Law Enforcement, which issued a press release on April 7, 2010, stating in the headline "Governor Crist announces lowest crime rate in 39 years." The purpose of the press release was to announce the state's Annual Uniform Crime Report for 2009. The press release stated that "the report indicates the state’s overall index crime rate has reached a 39-year low, declining by 6.4 percent in 2009, compared to 2008. The number of violent crimes (murder, forcible sex offenses, robbery and aggravated assault) committed in Florida dropped 10 percent last year; the number of non-violent crimes (burglary, larceny and motor vehicle theft) decreased 6.2 percent." The report includes offenses reported during 2009 and data submitted by 409 of the 415 local, county and state law enforcement agencies that serve approximately 99.9 percent of the state’s population, according to the press release. The FDLE's website includes a chart of crime stats starting in 1971. For 1971 it states that Florida's population was about 7.04 million and the total number of crimes was 399,055. Those numbers translated to a rate of 5,667.5 crimes per 100,000 people. By 2009, the state's population had risen to about 18.75 million and the total number of crimes was 824,559. That translated to a crime rate of 4,397.5 crimes per 100,000 -- or the lowest since the state started counting in 1971. So clearly the crime rate in 2009 was the lowest it had been since 1971. But it's worth noting that the drop in the crime rate below the 1971 figure -- 5,667.5 -- occurred years before Crist became governor in January 2007. The rate fell to 5,604.3 in 2000 and then stayed below that 1971 figure every year since. The rate was 4,632 in 2006, rose to 4,694.7 in 2007, rose to 4,699.8 in 2008 and then fell to 4,397.5. In other words, for two of Crist's years in office as governor the crime rate increased while in one year it decreased. We asked Crist campaign spokesman Danny Kanner if Crist should get credit for the crime rate dropping to the lowest rate in 39 years if it had already dropped below that 1971 rate before he took office Kanner wrote back: "If the statement is 'Florida is enjoying its lowest crime rate in 39 years,' that means it's lower with Crist as governor than the years prior to the time he took office dating back 39 years, which is true." We wondered did FDLE collect the data the same way in 1971 as it did for 2009? We spoke to Kristen Chernosky, a spokeswoman at FDLE. She said that FDLE collected the data in 1971 the same as today -- by asking law enforcement agencies across the state to voluntarily submit it. We asked: Did the vast majority comply during the first year? Chernosky said there were 334 agencies that reported in 1971 but Chernosky was uncertain how many agencies existed at that time so she didn't have a percentage of reporting compliance. Of course, crime statistics are only as good as the agencies that report them. In at least a few high-profile instances, South Florida police agencies were accused of doctoring crime reports: * In Boca Raton in 1998, investigators concluded that a captain altered nearly 400 crime reports the previous year to make them look less serious than they were. The original list sent to the FDLE reported 3,250 crimes while the correct list reported 3,635 crimes, the Miami Herald reported in 1998. * In Broward County, the state attorney's office launched an investigation in 2003 into allegations that Broward Sheriff's Office deputies manipulated crime statistics by using "exceptional clearances" -- when a crime is declared solved despite making no arrests, according to a Jan. 6, 2008, Miami Herald article. Deputies were accused of doctoring stats by making up false confessions and pinning crimes on the wrong individuals. * After complaints by a police union in Miami, in 2007 the Florida Department of Law Enforcement investigated allegations that Miami police doctored crime statistics to make the city appear safer than it was. An Oct. 6, 2007, article in the Miami Herald stated that the reporter found "dozens of reports that were classified as less-serious offenses than the facts in the reports would indicate." The FBI and the Florida Department of Law Enforcement found no evidence of a systematic effort to suppress crime numbers. But fudging crime stats is nothing new, said Dennis Jay Kenney, a professor at the John Jay College of Criminal Justice in New York. "There is no reason to believe the cheating is any worse now than it was 20 years ago -- that is a longstanding problem,'' he said. Kenney said it's possible to argue that the auditing procedures today are better than in the past but still "yes they can cheat." So how does Crist's claim stack up? He's right on the math that the state's crime rate in 2009 was lower than it was in 1971. But Crist omits that it had dropped below the 1971 rate before he became governor and that the rate went up his first two years in office. So for that omission, we rate this claim Mostly True.

pomt-03484	"47 - New provisions ObamaCare charges the IRS with implementing, according to the Government Accountability Office."	true	/ohio/statements/2013/jun/12/dave-joyce/rep-dave-joyce-says-irs-must-carry-out-47-provisio/	A number of Republican lawmakers recently have sought to link two longtime targets of conservatives: President Barack Obama’s health care law and the Internal Revenue Service, which is under fire for its role in scrutinizing some Tea Party groups and others. PolitiFact, like our colleagues at FactCheck.org and the Washington Post Fact Checker, has examined several related claims from lawmakers including Rep. Michele Bachmann of Minnesota and Senate GOP leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky. We rated as False the claim that the IRS is "going to be in charge of our health care." We found the claim that the IRS will be in charge of "a huge national database" on health care that will include Americans’ "personal, intimate, most close-to-the-vest-secrets" so ridiculous that we gave it our Pants on Fire! rating. Rep. David Joyce of Russell Township made a claim that looked to have a more solid foundation in a Tweet posted June 5: "47 - New provisions ObamaCare charges the IRS with implementing, according to the Government Accountability Office." We quickly found the source, the GAO's report to Congress of June 2012, and we did not have to look far into it. The report begins: "The Internal Revenue Service's implementation of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act is a massive undertaking that involves 47 statutory provisions and extensive coordination across not only IRS, but multiple agencies and external partners." That backs up Joyce's statement. But we thought knowing more about the 47 provisions would be useful. The IRS has posted a list of its roles in implementing the health care law, which include everything from levying additional payroll taxes on certain high-income Americans to taxation of medical devices and brand-name drugs. Among the key roles are approving subsidies for Americans seeking insurance on newly created health exchanges, and confirming that taxpayers have health insurance -- and assessing a financial penalty if they do not. (The penalties start at $95 per adult in 2013 and rise to $695 per adult in 2016.) The revenue provisions are vital to the health care law, the Treasury Department Inspector General said in a report this year. "Revenue provisions contained in the legislation are designed to generate $438 billion to help pay for the overall cost of health care reform," the report said. "More than 40 of these provisions added to or amended the Internal Revenue Code and represent the largest set of tax law changes the IRS has had to implement in more than 20 years." "Indeed," the Post's Fact Checker noted, "the Supreme Court upheld the law precisely because the individual mandate fell within Congress’s taxation power (even though the Obama administration had tried hard to claim this was not a tax)." Other federal agencies, such as the Department of Health and Human Services, are also involved in implementation of the law. Far more responsibility falls on the Department of Health and Human Services, which has taken the lead in organizing its implementation, providing information to the public about the law and providing oversight. Joyce’s statement is accurate. On the Truth-O-Meter, it rates as True.	None	Dave Joyce	None	None	None	2013-06-12T06:00:00	2013-06-05	['None']
pomt-05246	Figures cited by Gov. Scott Walker "are not commonly used" to measure job creation.	half-true	/wisconsin/statements/2012/jun/01/tom-barrett/democrat-tom-barrett-says-republican-gov-scott-wal/	Talk about jobs has dominated the Wisconsin recall election, and in the run-up to the June 5, 2012 vote much of the discussion has turned into a numbers game. As in: My numbers are better (and more official) than your numbers. Much of the confusion stems from the unusual decision by the Walker administration to release a batch of 2011 jobs data almost six weeks before it is to be released by the federal Bureau of Labor Statistics. The figures come from a census of about 95 percent of state employers, and are viewed as the most accurate measure of employment in Wisconsin. The numbers, which show an increase of more than 23,000 jobs in 2011, will eventually be used to update the less-accurate monthly BLS numbers Barrett has used to claim a jobs decline. During the May 31, 2012 debate at Marquette University, Barrett said of Walker: "I'm saying that he came up with a new set of numbers that are based on a new set of numbers that are used but are not commonly used." So just how common are these numbers? This isn’t the first time we’ve visited this issue. The last time this flared up, we rated False Walker’s claim that the jobs numbers were "final" because the feds had not yet verified them. We rated Walker’s claim the state added 33,200 jobs on his watch Mostly False, in part because he combined the unverified annual census data for 2011 with less reliable monthly survey data for 20122 And we rated False Barrett’s claim Walker "cooked the books" by releasing numbers "he just dreamed up." Since then, things have changed a bit. On May 30, 2012, the Walker administration claimed the state’s census numbers had been verified by the feds and that the number was now even higher -- 23,608. (In a new separate item, we rated Half True that Walker claim from the debate.) The feds have only said they are done reviewing the state’s figures but, following past practice, will not release any information until June 28, 2012, when numbers for all 50 states are released. There’s no question Walker rush-released the census numbers. Barrett is right that preliminary census figures are are not typically cited. And there tends to be more focus by the public and media on the monthly numbers. But the census numbers certainly are regularly used. Indeed, the feds use them to firm up the basis for the monthly numbers. We rate Barrett’s claim Half True. (You can comment on this item on the Journal Sentinel's website).

pomt-12537	"I have not called for impeachment" of President Donald Trump.	pants on fire!	/truth-o-meter/statements/2017/apr/19/maxine-waters/maxine-waters-wrong-say-she-has-not-called-trumps-/	More than perhaps any member of Congress, Rep. Maxine Waters, D-Calif., has discussed the possibility of impeaching President Donald Trump. So it was a bit of a surprise to hear her say she has "not called for impeachment" of Trump during a recent interview on MSNBC. Here’s the backstory. On the morning of April 18, 2017, Rep. Maxine Waters, D-Calif., tweeted, "The President is a liar, his actions are contemptible, & I'm going to fight everyday until he's impeached." See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com Later that day, when Waters sat for an interview with MSNBC’s Craig Melvin, the anchor read her tweet on air and asked her about it. Here’s a portion of their exchange: Melvin: "You just started that by saying the question becomes, should we wait to call for impeachment until we have the answers to have that question..." Waters: "Well, I have not..." Melvin: "-- or some of the questions." Waters: "-- I have not called for impeachment." Melvin: "You said, ‘I'm going to fight every day until he's impeached.’ That's what you tweeted." Waters: "Yes, but here's what I've said. Here's what I've said. I've said that we need the information. We need to connect the dots. We need the facts in order to do the impeachment. And I'm going to work every day to try and help get those facts and to reveal them to the republic, to our public until, of course, impeachment is taking place." A reader asked us to look into Waters’ statement that "I have not called for impeachment." We found that’s not accurate. During the interview on MSNBC, Waters seemed to draw a distinction between calling for impeachment and calling for investigations into matters that could lead to impeachment. And she has taken a more procedural approach at times, saying, for instance, during an April 2 CNN interview that "we want to know about the hacking … and the interference with our elections. And I really want to know, because I know, if we can prove collusion, then he is impeachable. A lot of people don’t want to talk about that, but I do." (Waters’ office did not respond to an inquiry for this article.) However, even if you grant that this distinction by Waters is valid, ample evidence exists showing Waters actually calling for impeachment. For instance, on Feb. 3, Waters gave an interview on the streaming video channel Cheddar in which she said her "greatest desire is to lead (Trump) right into impeachment." Then, just three days before her appearance on MSNBC, Waters spoke at a rally on the Capitol grounds to demand that Trump release his tax filings. "I don’t respect this president," she told the crowd. "I don’t trust this president. He’s not working in the best interests of the American people. … I will fight every day until he is impeached." She then proceeded to start the crowd on a chant of "Impeach 45," referring to Trump, the 45th president. The crowd responded to her invitation, and Waters led them by chanting "Impeach 45" three times. She then closed her speech saying, "Go ahead: Impeach 45" before exiting the stage. You can see Waters and the crowd chanting in this video. Waters didn’t seem to be hiding the fact that she had chanted "Impeach 45." The same day she appeared on MSNBC, Waters retweeted a CNN video clip of her speaking and leading the chants. Our ruling Waters said on MSNBC that "I have not called for impeachment." She has at times called for investigations that could lead to Trump’s impeachment, rather than calling for impeachment directly. But on at least two occasions -- the Cheddar interview and the tax rally -- she did call for Trump’s impeachment directly, in one case literally cheerleading for impeaching Trump at a rally at the U.S. Capitol. We rate her claim Pants on Fire. See Figure 2 on PolitiFact.com	None	Maxine Waters	None	None	None	2017-04-19T16:49:39	2017-04-18	['None']

These are not high-paying jobs, as the U.S. Department of Labor estimates this is an industry sector with the lowest average wages and the lowest proportion of its workforce earning minimum or subminimum wage jobs."	mostly true	/new-jersey/statements/2012/dec/16/lou-greenwald/lou-greenwald-says-low-paying-jobs-seeing-most-gro/	Job growth in some fields appears to be a bumper crop in the Garden State, but it’s not the kind that appeals to Assembly Majority Leader Lou Greenwald (D-Camden). Greenwald said during a Dec. 4 press conference in Trenton that the state needs higher-paying jobs to grow the economy. "Right now one of our highest job growth sectors is Leisure and Hospitality," Greenwald said during the press conference to announce a Democrat bills package focusing on job creation and economic development. "We've added jobs that mostly fall within the restaurant and bar sector industry. These are not high-paying jobs, as the U.S. Department of Labor estimates this is an industry sector with the lowest average wages and the lowest proportion of its workforce earning minimum or subminimum wage jobs." Greenwald is correct that Leisure and Hospitality is one of New Jersey’s highest job growth sectors, and that the jobs are considered low-paying. The rest of his statement was erroneous, however. Let’s look at each part of Greenwald’s remarks. The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics tracks data in 11 major employment sectors, including Leisure and Hospitality. Jobs in that sector typically include bartenders, servers, food-service workers and other service-oriented jobs. "Jobs in this sector are often part-time, seasonal, and paid at low hourly rates," said Joseph Seneca, an economics professor at the Edward J. Bloustein School of Planning and Public Policy at Rutgers University in New Brunswick. Total employment in that sector in New Jersey increased by 5,700 jobs (1.7 percent) from October 2011 to October 2012, according to BLS data. The only sector with higher job growth for the same period was Education and Health Services, at 16,600 jobs (2.7 percent). Next, let’s review salary for both sectors. Leisure and Hospitality jobs in New Jersey had the lowest average salary in 2011, at about $22,329, according to BLS data and Seneca. The average salary in the state that year was $57,546. The numbers are also low when looking at average weekly wages, said Martin Kohli, a chief regional economist for the BLS. For first-quarter 2012, the average weekly wage in New Jersey for workers in Leisure and Hospitality fields was $450, according to a database Koli prepared for us. That’s the lowest salary of the 11 sectors that BLS tracks, Koli said. How did Education and Health Services compare? In New Jersey, the average annual wage in 2011 was $47,338. The weekly salary for first-quarter 2012 was $893. "The Majority Leader acknowledged that we have created some jobs in New Jersey," Brian McGinnis, Greenwald's communications director, said in an e-mail. "No one is disputing that. He used the example of the Leisure and Hospitality sector to make a larger point. As the data … show, while this sector has added jobs, they are not for the most part the kind of good-paying middle-class jobs that will help drive a strong economic recovery in New Jersey." Now let’s look at the rest of Greenwald’s claim. Greenwald said Leisure and Hospitality has "the lowest proportion of its workforce earning minimum or subminimum wage jobs." That would mean a small number of those workers are earning minimum wage or below, and that’s not accurate. McGinnis acknowledged that Greenwald misspoke. "The data show the Leisure and Hospitality sector is the industry with the highest proportion of its workers earning minimum wage or below," McGinnis said. " The data further show that about one half of all workers who are paid at or below minimum wage are working in this industry -- primarily in restaurant/food service." Our ruling Greenwald said, "Right now one of our highest job growth sectors is Leisure and Hospitality. We've added jobs that mostly fall within the restaurant and bar sector industry. These are not high-paying jobs, as the U.S. Department of Labor estimates this is an industry sector with the lowest average wages and the lowest proportion of its workforce earning minimum or subminimum wage jobs." Leisure and Hospitality saw the second-highest rate of job growth in New Jersey in 2011, but a BLS economist confirmed that the average weekly salary of workers for that sector is the lowest among all sectors tracked. Greenwald, however, misstated that those jobs have the lowest proportion of workers earning minimum wage or below. We rate Greenwald’s statement Mostly True. To comment on this story, go to NJ.com.

pomt-11060	Says Republican gubernatorial candidate Adam Laxalt "tried to cut a deal with big pharma" in a lawsuit.	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2018/jun/25/afscme/ad-falsely-accuses-nevadas-gop-governor-candidate-/	For about two weeks in June, the Nevada chapter of the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees, or AFSCME, had a television ad up in the Las Vegas and Reno markets. At a cost of over half a million dollars, the ad from the union of government workers skewered Republican gubernatorial candidate Adam Laxalt for cozying up to drug companies. In 2017, Nevada passed a law to help put a lid on rising diabetes drug prices. Two major pharmaceutical trade groups sued to block it. Attorney General Laxalt’s office has been defending the measure and the AFSCME ad said he slacked off. "Laxalt tried to cut a deal with big pharma instead of standing up for us, and drug prices continue to rise," the ad said. "Adam Laxalt delivered for drug companies, not for us." Legally, it is premature to say Laxalt delivered for anybody, because both sides are waiting for a judge to rule. In the same vein, the law won’t fully kick in until Jan. 15, 2019, so it is too early to fault it for not controlling drug prices. That leaves whether Laxalt "tried to cut a deal with big pharma" as the key claim to check. AFSCME sent us their supporting evidence. It was a September court filing that said the two sides had failed to settle before bringing the matter before a judge. (The defendant in the case is Nevada Gov. Brian Sandoval. The plaintiffs are the drug trade associations Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America and Biotechnology Innovation Organization. ) "The parties’ counsel discussed a potential resolution to avoid this motion," the filing said. "But on Sept. 12, 2017, defendants’ counsel advised that defendant Sandoval would prefer that plaintiffs proceed with the filing of a motion." To AFSCME, the discussion of a "resolution" amounted to trying to cut a deal. But that interpretation goes way beyond what the words mean, University of Nevada law professor Thomas Main told us. "That sort of phrasing is common in these filings," Main said. "I wouldn't read much, or anything, into that alone." Main noted that state and federal court rules require both sides to try to settle out of court. Basically, if the parties can avoid tying up court time, they should do so. The rules say the parties must talk to each other and if they fail to come to terms, they must certify that they "were unable to resolve or narrow the dispute without court intervention." And that’s what the words in the court filing do. Interestingly, Laxalt’s campaign staff pointed to the same words in the same document to show that he didn’t cut a deal with the drug company representatives. If he had, the case would have settled, and it hasn’t. A union health fund attempted to join the suit on the side of the state on the grounds that Laxalt hadn’t filed a vigorous response to the drug makers’ suit. The judge in the case turned the group down. No Laxalt The AFSCME ad puts Laxalt at the center of the discussions with the drug trade groups. Actually, he left that to others in his office. Laxalt spokesman Parker Briden told us that he hadn’t participated, and a Deputy Attorney General confirmed that. He was not on the phone calls with the drug company lawyers. That further undercuts the assertion that he tried to cut a deal. The union noted that Laxalt received campaign contributions from drug maker Eli Lilly. Eli Lilly gave $3,100. The company sells drugs for treating diabetes covered by the state’s pricing transparency law. Our ruling An ad from the AFSCME union said Laxalt tried to cut a deal with drug makers. The only evidence that Laxalt’s office attempted to settle a suit brought by drug trade groups is a court filing that certifies that the parties failed to come to terms. That interpretation ignores that court rules require the parties to see if they can settle out of court, and to certify that they tried and and failed. The ad puts far too much weight on legal boilerplate, a Nevada law professor said. On top of that, Laxalt did not personally participate in those early discussions between his office and the drug makers’ lawyers. We rate this claim False.

pomt-08410	Says Bruce Starr broke the law by letting lobbyists wine and dine him in Maui.	false	/oregon/statements/2010/oct/21/chuck-riley/chuck-riley-says-bruce-starr-broke-law-taking-free/	PolitiFact Oregon remembers 2006 all too well. Leggings made a fashion comeback. Democrats took back the Oregon House. And that fall, The Oregonian reported on a bunch of state legislators for accepting lavish trips to Maui courtesy of the Oregon Beer and Wine Distributors Association. One of those legislators was state Sen. Bruce Starr, R-Hillsboro, who faces Rep. Chuck Riley, D-Hillsboro, in the Nov. 2 general election. To no one’s surprise, Riley is bringing up Starr’s stay at the palatial Grand Wailea Hotel in May 2002 to attend the distributors’ conference. Riley’s ad, "On Our Side," starts with a photo of Starr and a pretty Hawaiian view in the background. A female announcer, backed by a breezy ukulele, says: "What’s not pretty? The ethics commission ruled he broke the law by letting lobbyists foot the bill." (There also appears to be a pork chop dressed up to resemble a pineapple on the table.) But it’s not true. The state ethics commission did fine Starr in 2007 -- but not for going to Hawaii on the dime of a lobbying group. Rather, Starr was fined for failing to disclose the 2002 conference on annual disclosure forms filed with the state. At the time, it was perfectly legal for lobbyists to treat legislators to such trips and for legislators to accept them. The distributors, led by lobbyist Paul Romain, paid about $18,000 in 2002 and in 2004 to fly, feed, shelter and entertain a total of seven state legislators at two conferences. Starr attended the four-day conference with his wife. The ethics commission fined him $300 for not disclosing that trip and another education trip to Israel paid by another organization. Starr said at the time that he didn’t report the trip because the lobbyist, Romain, told him he didn’t have to. He amended his reports, showing that the beer and wine distributors paid $961 for airfare, $1,007 for his hotel room, $300 for food and beverages and $250 for golf. Molly Woon, a spokeswoman for Senate Democrats, defends the statement. Perhaps PolitiFact Oregon is overthinking the issue? "He broke the law for taking a lobbyist-paid trip; you can say more, but that's the basic fact," she said. We have to disagree. Starr broke no laws or ethics rules by taking the trip at a lobbyist’s expense, which is what the Democrats’ ad claims. What Starr did wrong was fail to report the trip. The statement is False.

pomt-10183	"Barack Obama has the longest track record of any candidate in this election in support of the 'Bridge To Nowhere.' "	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/sep/23/john-mccain/turning-the-tables-on-obama/	They say the best defense is good offense. Which probably explains the latest tack by John McCain's campaign on the Bridge to Nowhere backlash. For weeks, the media has castigated Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin for her repeated claim "I told the Congress ‘thanks, but no thanks,’ on that Bridge to Nowhere." In our analysis , we noted that while Palin formally put an end to the project, it was nearly dead anyway, and Alaska still kept the money for other transportation projects. We also noted that Palin flip-flopped , having supported the bridge project during her run to become governor. Recently, the McCain campaign has tried to turn the tables. According to several recent campaign press releases: "Barack Obama has the longest track record of any candidate in this election in support of the 'Bridge To Nowhere.' " We’re betting if you’re on this Web site, you’re enough of a political junkie to know what the Bridge to Nowhere is. But just in case, it was a plan to build a nearly $400-million Alaska bridge to connect the tiny city of Ketchikan to Gravina, an island with just a few dozen residents and an airport. The project was derisively nicknamed the Bridge to Nowhere by a government watchdog group and became a national symbol of federal pork-barrel spending. As Exhibit A to show Obama’s longtime support, the McCain campaign notes that Obama voted in 2005 for the conference report on the Highway Reauthorization Bill, which included $225-milion for the Gravina Island bridge. The conference report passed 91-4. And yes, McCain was among the four who voted against it. In a floor statement explaining his opposition, McCain specifically referenced the Gravina Island bridge among his many concerns with the bill. But does Obama’s vote for the bill equal support for the Bidge to Nowhere? Let’s put this in some perspective. The bill included $286.5-billion though 2009 for highway, mass transit, safety and research programs. The Alaska bridge was less than a tenth of 1 percent of the spending in the bill. "So they’re saying that because Obama was among the 91 senators who voted for the highway funding bill, that makes him a supporter of the bridge? That’s laughable," Obama campaign spokesman Tommy Vietor told PolitiFact. We agree. The bill included more than $1.3-billion for transportation projects in Illinois, which also could explain Obama's vote. "This gets so goofy," said Keith Ashdown, a spokesman for Taxpayers for Common Sense. Ashdown is the guy who saddled the Gravina Island project with the dubious moniker, "Bridge to Nowhere," a catchy name that helped the project become a national poster child for wasteful government spending. "He (Obama) voted for the bill that would have made the Bridge to Nowhere a reality," Ashdown said. "But I don’t know if that means he supported it. I don’t think that’s true." But there’s some more to consider. With the Bridge to Nowhere a national laughingstock, U.S. Sen. Tom Coburn, R-Okla., in October 2005 proposed an amendment that would have redirected $125-million in funding for the Alaska bridge toward reconstruction of a New Orleans bridge damaged by Hurricane Katrina. Obama voted against the amendment, which failed. McCain was not present and didn’t vote. On Nov. 15, the Chicago Tribune printed a commentary from Obama which, in part, explained his decision. "Others intent on cutting spending have pointed to Alaska’s ‘Bridge to Nowhere’ as a wasteful project," Obama wrote. "I agree and believe that it represents the first type of project we should cut. But it’s wrong to single out one state’s pork project. If we’re serious about shared responsibility, let’s eliminate all pork projects in all states." Due to uproar over the so-called Bridge to Nowhere project, a congressional committee directed the $225-million earmarked for the Gravina Island bridge to the Alaska Department of Transportation. So Alaska would keep the money, but it would no longer be tied to the Bridge to Nowhere. Alaska could decide how to spend the money as it saw fit. They could even decide to spend it on the bridge. By way of timeline, it was a year later — in the fall of 2006 — that Palin, then a candidate for governor of Alaska, assured the Ketchikan Chamber of Commerce she was all for the bridge, and told the Anchorage Daily News "the window is now — while our congressional delegation is in a strong position to assist." It was a view she changed when she became governor. Early in 2007, she did not include funding for the bridge in her budget. And faced with a project whose pricetag had ballooned to $400-million, the fact that much of the federal money for the project had been spent on other transportation projects, and little prospect that the federal government would throw any more money at the unpopular project, she formally pulled the plug. Palin’s role has been well-reported in the media. But back to Obama. Yes, he voted in favor of the massive transportation bill that included funds for the Bridge to Nowhere. But we don’t think that translates to support for the project. Some might argue that the Coburn amendment gave Obama a clear opportunity to kill the Bridge to Nowhere — where it was not lumped in with other projects — but Obama chose not to. But again, does that equate to support for the project? In his commentary, Obama made clear he did not support the project, but didn't think it was right to single out one specific earmark from one state. The original bill inlcuded literally thousands of projects, with a little something for every state. And it passed with a resounding 91 senators in favor. We think it’s a stretch to claim that Obama supported the Bridge to Nowhere. Certainly not the way Palin once did when she was running for governor of Alaska. Voting for a $236-billion spending bill that included the Alaska bridge is hardly support for it. But because Obama could have voted to kill the project with the Coburn Amendment, we’ll give it a Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.	None	John McCain	None	None	None	2008-09-23T00:00:00	2008-09-15	['Barack_Obama']

pomt-05960	Sherrod Brown "has voted with Barack Obama 95 percent of the time."	true	/ohio/statements/2012/jan/25/ohio-republican-party/ohio-republicans-say-sherrod-brown-has-voted-obama/	Republicans in Washington, D.C., and Ohio have vast ideological differences with U.S. Sen. Sherrod Brown, an Ohio Democrat. Brown says the government plays a positive role in people’s lives when it provides a safety net (new health insurance programs, financial regulation, help for cash-strapped cities and schools) while supporting the private sector. Republicans say the government needs to step back to propel the economic engine that is the private sector. While lofty, that makes for a poor sound bite. But the GOP knows this, and is prepared to frame its November election effort against Brown like this: "When you look at his voting record, what's going to stick with voters is that he has voted with Barack Obama 95 percent of the time. He can talk about differences some of the time, but you've got to look at the record." That quote comes from Christopher Maloney, communications director for the Ohio Republican Party. Maloney made the claim to The Plain Dealer during a telephone interview in December 2011, and again with a slight variation on Jan. 22, 2012, that we’ll discuss in a moment. It is that variation that we're checking here. The interview was for a story, published Jan. 23, on how Republicans plan to campaign against Brown in the coming political season. While the newspaper checked out the figure and had reason to believe it was accurate, it also believed -- for purposes of PolitiFact Ohio -- that the figure deserved further examination, and a ruling on the Truth-O-Meter. After all, voters are likely to hear the claim a lot this year. Maloney said his figure came from Congressional Quarterly, a nonpartisan journalism organization that reports on Capitol Hill lawmaking dispassionately. CQ, as it is known, serves as a bit of a bible for journalists, congressional offices and even lobbyists, because it goes into the weeds of legislating like few other publications do. Its reporting winds up in CQ Today, CQ Weekly, CQ online products, and an annual hard-bound political almanac, "Politics in America." Besides covering hearings and more, CQ examines voting patterns for every member of Congress and sorts them in ways that allow comparisons. One of those ways is through an annual examination of presidential support, or the number and percentage of votes by each lawmaker on bills in which the sitting president has staked a position. So, for example, CQ counted a vote for the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, better known as the economic stimulus bill, as a vote in support of the president. The same principle applied to the health care reform vote of 2010, to votes on taxes, the debt ceiling, and so on. Presidents weigh in on fewer than half of all Senate votes (Obama had a position on 39 percent of the Senate’s 235 votes last year), and some bills have broad bipartisan support no matter who is in the White House. No lawmaker winds up with a presidential support score of zero -- not even such small-government fans as Republicans Jim DeMint of South Carolina or Rand Paul of Kentucky. But the closer to zero, or to 100, a score is, the higher the lawmaker’s opposition or support for the president’s agenda. Back to the figure Maloney cited: He stated from the start that his source was CQ. He originally said the figure for Brown was 97 percent -- that is, that Brown has voted with President Obama 97 percent of the time. That was based on an average of CQ ratings, for 2009 (Obama’s first year, when Brown scored 96 percent) and 2010 (98 percent). Maloney was accurate when he made the statement because CQ Weekly had not yet published its ratings for 2011. That changed, just before The Plain Dealer was about to publish its story. A new issue of CQ Weekly came out, with new numbers covering 2011. And the positions of Brown and Obama, it turns out, diverged slightly more often in 2011 than in the previous two years. Brown’s presidential support rating dropped to 92 percent in 2011 -- matching, it turns out, the 92 percent support rate that other Democratic senators had on average for the president last year. In contrast, Brown’s Ohio colleague, Republican freshman Rob Portman, voted with the president 59.5 percent of the time in 2011 -- which while not as high as the 71.90 percent rate of Maine Republican Susan Collins, still put Portman in the top tier, at 13th, of Republicans voting most often for Obama’s positions. DeMint and Paul, by contrast, each had presidential support ratings of 41 percent in 2011. When averaged for the three years of Obama’s presidency so far, then, Brown’s support fell from 97 percent to 95 percent. (Do the math: 96 plus 98 plus 92, divided by 3, equals 95.3.) Maloney, when told by The Plain Dealer that CQ had had just put out brand new figures, updated his statement to reflect that 95 percent rate. We report this without judgment on whether it is good or bad to support the Obama agenda. Brown has disagreed with Obama on foreign trade and on some greenhouse gas-regulation issues. But Maloney says that "you’ve got to look at the record." And the record -- compiled not by an opposition party but by a publication regarded as eminently impartial -- provides an average of 95 percent. The figure is current. On the Truth-O-Meter, Maloney’s claim merits a rating of True.	None	Ohio Republican Party	None	None	None	2012-01-25T06:00:00	2012-01-22	['None']

pomt-04082	"Thanks to Washington, nearly everyone will pay more in taxes in 2013. Somehow people think it's just the wealthy. It's not."	half-true	/wisconsin/statements/2013/jan/20/scott-walker/gov-scott-walker-says-nearly-everyone-will-pay-mor/	Republican Gov. Scott Walker, a potential 2016 presidential candidate, frequently tweets on national political issues from @ScottKWalker. As the fiscal cliff deal approached, Walker pleaded with Washington not to "screw up" the economy by letting taxes go up. He then criticized the eventual deal in a series of tweets, culminating with this bipartisan slam on Jan. 4, 2013: "Thanks to Washington, nearly everyone will pay more in taxes in 2013. Somehow people think it’s just the wealthy. It’s not." Walker poked at "Washington" again in his Jan. 15, 2013 "state of the state" speech, saying federal officials were putting more money in the hands of the government, not the people. Much of the fiscal-cliff debate, which ended in a New Year’s Day deal, focused on whether to extend the across-the-board reduction in federal income-tax rates approved in 2001 and 2003 under President George W. Bush. Those lower rates were due to expire at the end of 2012, but the cliff deal extended them. For almost everyone, that is. The deal locked in the reduced Bush-era rates for taxable income up to $400,000 (single filers) or $450,000 (joint). For the portion of a filer’s taxable income above those amounts, the tax rate will rise to 39.6 percent, the Clinton-era rate. Fewer than 1 percent of US households are expected to report taxable income above those thresholds in 2013, a Tax Policy Center study found. The deal kicks in a few other tax increases for wealthier folks, adding to some that were approved as part of federal health care reforms. But income-tax rates for most people will not change. So what does Walker mean when he says, "nearly everyone will pay more in taxes in 2013"? When we asked for backup, Walker campaign spokeswoman Nicole Tieman sent us a Wall Street Journal blog item on the deal’s failure to extend a different tax break -- the Social Security payroll tax holiday of 2011 and 2012. The holiday came from President Barack Obama as a continuation of Democratic-backed measures passed in the 2009 stimulus package. It reduced the worker share of Social Security taxes taken off paychecks from 6.2 percent to 4.2 percent. For example, that gave workers making $75,000 to $100,000 an average break of $1,194 on federal taxes in 2012, another Tax Policy Center study found. The average across all income levels was $721. In 2012, Obama initially sought to extend the payroll break again, but Republicans were split on it, and some Democrats weren’t thrilled with it either. So Obama and Congress let it die a quiet death. Three experts told us a large share of Americans will see their taxes rise in 2013 compared to 2012 because of the disappearance of the Social Security payroll tax holiday. Some 77 percent of all U.S. households will be paying more in taxes overall in 2013 than in 2012, almost completely because the payroll tax is returning to its old level, said Roberton Williams, a fellow at the Tax Policy Center, a project of the Urban Institute and Brookings Institution. William McBride, the chief economist at the business-backed Tax Foundation, told us that "anyone with a job that pays wages is affected, so, a high percentage of the population." He said that 83 percent of tax returns report some wages. Chuck Marr, director of federal tax policy at the left-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, confirmed it would hit "every paycheck." So, Walker is on to something regarding the payroll tax, though Williams said "nearly everyone" was a bit of a reach. There are a couple other important points to cover about Walker’s claim about the deal, formally known as The American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012. Marr and Williams noted that Walker’s description is just one of the ways to look at the tax situation. "Is it actually a tax increase, or are we just not giving you a break anymore?" asked Williams. Unlike the Bush-era tax cuts, which Republican sponsors tried repeatedly to make permanent, the payroll tax was designed as short-term boost to the economy, Williams said. Marr called the Social Security tax holiday a political orphan, with neither party much interested in fighting over keeping it. If Washington had not acted on the payroll and income tax rates,90 percent of Americans would have seen a tax increase, Williams said. In blaming Washington for the tax increase, Walker takes into account the decision to end one break -- the Social Security payroll cut -- but does not factor in the new life that Congress and the president gave to another break, the income tax cuts that were extended for most. Our rating Walker tweeted, "Thanks to Washington, nearly everyone will pay more in taxes in 2013. Somehow people think it's just the wealthy. It's not." From the perspective of the real net effect on people’s tax rates compared to last year in the wake of the deal, Walker’s claim about the fiscal-cliff legislation rings pretty true, depending on your definition of what constitutes "nearly everyone." The expiration of the Social Security payroll tax holiday means that tax will revert to higher, pre-2011 rates for everyone who earns a paycheck, though a minority of tax filers have no wage earnings. But he makes a glass-half-empty claim about a broad deal by viewing the result in a narrow context of one tax decision, while leaving out important information about the tax effect of another major decision that was part of the deal. It would also have the ring of truth to say that "thanks to Washington" a massive tax increase was averted in the same deal. But then, he only had 140 characters to work with. We rate Walker’s claim Half True.	None	Scott Walker	None	None	None	2013-01-20T09:00:00	2013-01-04	['None']
pomt-08349	Dan Seals has been running for office "since before there were, like, iPods."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/oct/27/robert-dold/robert-dold-targets-dan-seals-illinois-race-using-/	It's not every day that a campaign ad lands in our inbox and makes us laugh out loud -- especially in the midst of a campaign cycle with commercials featuring Viagra-fueled sex offenders, puppy mass-murderers and roving psychopaths. But the ad aired by Republican Robert Dold targeting Democrat Dan Seals had us at "broheim." It features a charming if foul-mouthed sea lion hired to film an "endorsement" for Dan Seals. Seals (not the sea lion) is running for the Chicago-area seat being vacated by Rep. Mark Kirk, the Republican nominee for Senate. With a slight Democratic edge and a moderate, suburban vibe, the 10th District is one of the rare GOP-held seats that's actually in play for the Democrats this year. In fact, political handicapper Charlie Cook rates it Lean Democratic, meaning that Dold, even though he's a Republican running in a Republican year, is airing the ad as a slight underdog. Perhaps that's why the Dold campaign went for an ad with potential for buzz. In any case, the script is so priceless that we'll reprint it in its entirety here: Narrator: "And now, a very special political endorsement." Sea lion: "Dan Seals is a proud resident of the 10th District." Director (voice off-screen): "Actually, he's not." Sea lion: "What, he's not?" Director: "Cut!" Sea lion: "Dan Seals is a tax fighter." Director: "No, he's all about raising your taxes and increasing government spending." Sea lion: "Aaargh! For real, broheim?" Sea lion: "Dan Seals is a fresh new candidate." Director: "Nah, he's run like two times already and lost. I think he was running since before there were, like, iPods." Sea lion: "What the -- ?" (Bleep) Sea lion: "Look, if you want common-sense leadership in Congress, lower taxes and more jobs, just vote for Robert Dold." Sea lion (to director): "All righty, arf-arf. Where's my fish treat?" Closing jingle: "It's Dold with a 'd,' not an 'e.'" We like the ad so much that we feel a bit guilty subjecting it to the Truth-O-Meter. But subject it we must. We could have looked at the question of whether Seals lives in the district or not. (A local media outlet in the district reported that Seals lives "a block and a half outside the district boundary." Meanwhile, the same article notes questions about Dold's own history of residing in the district. The Constitution only requires that a candidate live in the state where the election is being held.) But we didn't. Instead, we're looking at the burning question of whether the spokesmammal was correct when he said that Dan Seals was running for office "before there were, like, iPods." We first looked at Seals' biography. He has indeed run (and lost) for Congress twice before -- in 2006 and 2008. Prior to that, he worked in a variety of corporate and policy jobs, including a position in the U.S. Commerce Department and as an economics fellow in the U.S. Senate. Seals was clearly a policy-wonk in training, but none of these positions involved electoral politics, so we won't count them as positions in which he was "running." Even assuming that Seals started campaigning actively a year or more before the 2006 election, that would only peg the beginning of his career as a candidate to 2005. What about the iPod? Well, we located a Newsweek cover featuring Apple co-founder Steve Jobs holding the music player that's dated July 26, 2004. (Doesn't it look bulky?) So the iPod clearly existed well before Seals began to run for office. We found the original news release for Apple's initial unveiling of the iPod on Oct. 23, 2001. And units were on sale beginning on Nov. 10, 2001, according to the Consumer Electronics Association. So, versions of the iPod were on sale for three to four years before Seals began running for office. When we ran our findings by the Dold campaign, spokesman John McGovern replied, "This ad is intended to be light-hearted and a tongue-in-cheek response to the relentlessly negative tone of the Seals campaign. All cultural references are intended to be humorous and casual." Having waded through so much muck while reviewing this year's campaign commercials, we're all for light-hearted and tongue-in-cheek. And as you have probably picked up, we love this ad. But sometimes the Truth-O-Meter has to exercise tough love. So, as much as we love the pinniped, the ad got it wrong about the iPod, so we rate it, like, False.	None	Robert Dold	None	None	None	2010-10-27T15:02:03	2010-10-26	['Dan_Seals_(Illinois_politician)']

pomt-02437	Seventy-five percent of the young adults in this country are not mentally or physically fit to serve.	true	/rhode-island/statements/2014/mar/02/bing-west/author-bing-west-says-seventy-five-percent-young-a/	Bing West, Marine veteran of Vietnam and an expert on counterinsurgency warfare, was discussing military preparedness with host Gene Valicenti last week on WPRO-AM. They were talking about Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel’s proposed defense budget, which includes, among other spending cuts, trimming the Army from its current level of 520,000 troops to as low as 440,000 active duty soldiers, the lowest level since before World War II. West opposes the troop reductions, saying such cuts would make it difficult for the United States to respond quickly to future military threats. If those kinds of cuts must be made, he said, it is common sense to have a backup mobilization plan in place to rapidly increase the size of the military. In other words, he said, a draft. Besides the obvious political challenges in reinstituting the draft, which ended in 1973, West said there’s a logistical problem as well: Seventy-five percent of the young adults in this country are not mentally or physically fit to serve, he said. Watch out, Valicenti warned, Politifact might hear you. Well, we did. West’s number sounded high, so we went out to muster the facts. When we called West, he said he got the figure from reports he’d read in newspapers around the country, most recently the Washington Post. We looked for the original research that might have driven those reports, and we found it. The 75 percent unfit figure has been reported for a few years now. It came from a 2009 report called "Ready, Willing and Unable to Serve, 75 Percent of Young Adults Cannot Join the Military." The report was prepared by Mission Readiness, an organization that includes 89 retired military officials, including a former navy secretary, and officers from generals to chief petty officers and sergeant majors. The group advocates for improvements in the United States’ education system and the health of the nation’s youth. The report said increasing obesity rates among Americans ages 17 to 24, declining high school graduation rates and criminal backgrounds were severely narrowing the pool of applicants who could meet the armed forces’ academic and physical health standards for recruits. The report noted that one in four young Americans lacks a high school diploma and 30 percent of those who have one and try to enlist fail the military’s math and reading tests. It also estimated that 27 percent of those between 17 and 24 could not hit the armed forces’ weight limits and 32 percent had other health problems, such as asthma, poor eyesight or hearing or attention deficit disorders, that ruled them out for military service. The report also said about 10 percent of the potential military service population was ineligible because of at least one prior felony or serious misdemeanor. Mission:Readiness isn’t the only one sounding that alarm. On March 3, 2009, Curtis Gilroy, then the director of the accession policy office of the undersecretary for defense for personnel and readiness, told the U. S. Congress’ House Armed Services Committee pretty much the same thing. He cited the primary drivers as obesity and low high school graduation rates when he said "we find that only 25 percent of our young people today, aged 17 to 24, are qualified for military service. Not a good situation." Our ruling Bing West said 75 percent of young adults in the United States were physically or mentally unfit to serve in the military. The Defense Department and a non-governmental organization have both done research that support his claim. We find the statement True. (Comment on this ruling on providencejournal.com.

pomt-07734	Says that in a hearing, Rep. Gabrielle Giffords suggested to Gen. David Petraeus that the Army "put more emphasis on less environmentally damaging methods, like stabbing or clubbing enemy forces in order to minimize the carbon output."	pants on fire!	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/mar/01/chain-email/chain-e-mail-gabrielle-giffords-treats-satire-trut/	A reader recently forwarded us a chain e-mail with a rather striking claim about Rep. Gabrielle Giffords, D-Ariz., who is recovering from a brain injury after an assassination attempt in Tucson, Ariz., on Jan. 8, 2011. A version of it has been posted on a variety of blog sites, including this one. Here are excerpts: "I had no idea that this Congresswoman was such a nut case. "It was a tragedy that 19 people were shot and six died. As a result Giffords will be held out as a saint, when in fact, she is an idiot , a left wing ‘enviro-nut’ who should not be in Congress. The media only cares about her because she is a Democrat. Had she been a Republican, like the federal judge who was killed, she would have been off the front page the next day, as he has been. "I had forgotten she was the Congresswoman that was involved in the following exchange with General Petraeus: "Poster-child for what is wrong in Washington, DC Our Arizona 8th District US Congressional representative, the Hon. Gabrielle Giffords, in a meeting of the House Armed Services Committee, asked General David Petraeus the following question: ‘General Petraeus, what are you doing to reduce carbon emissions in the war on terror?’ Wow. I had to read, and re-read this several times to believe it. ... "What Google says about Rep. Giffords: Representative Gabrielle Giffords (D-Az) took Afghan Commander, General David Petraeus, to task for what she characterized as ‘willful disregard of the environmental impact of our war effort.’ ‘There is no policy, no plan to minimize carbon emissions in our military activities,’ Giffords charged. ‘Bombs are dropped and bullets are fired without considering the environmental impact.’ Giffords insisted that she was ‘not demanding an immediate halt to current military operations in the Middle East. I'm just saying that battle plans should include an environmental impact assessment as a regular part of the process before attacks are launched.’ "She also suggested that the Army ‘put more emphasis on less environmentally damaging methods, like stabbing or clubbing enemy forces in order to minimize the carbon output.’" We found it hard to believe that a member of Congress would actually say that the Army should "put more emphasis on less environmentally damaging methods, like stabbing or clubbing enemy forces in order to minimize the carbon output." So we set out to find the source. Our friends at Snopes.com provided the first clue, noting in a post from July 28, 2010 -- six months before the Tucson shooting -- that a false e-mail had been circulating about Giffords’ alleged questioning of Petraeus. Snopes.com explained that on June 16, 2010, Petraeus had testified before the House Armed Services Committee and that one of the lawmakers who questioned him was Giffords. She did indeed ask a question that combined elements of environmental and military policy, but the line of inquiry was rather different than what the e-mail suggested. "There's been a lot of attention back here in the United States on what's happening with the BP oil spill," Giffords said at the hearing. "And as we all know, the largest user of energy on the planet is actually the United States Air Force, and the (Department of Defense) is the largest user of energy in the United States. And I really want to commend the work done on behalf of DOD, and also what's happening in the field with our energy, but it's an area that I just really want to focus on. "And I know a lot of questions have been asked, but during the last three years, supply lines have increasingly threatened -- have been threatened, either by enemy action or through international places. And in places like Kandahar, where we have a large presence, we have been plugged in to a very unsustainable and really an incapable grid system. "We know that a major part of the upcoming Kandahar offensive will include some serious repairs and upgrades to the energy system which include small-scale solar and hydropower systems, and also some solar-powered streetlights. I'm just curious whether or not there's plans to utilize any of those same technologies at our bases around Afghanistan, and wouldn't that greatly reduce our need for fuel?" In other words, Giffords did not ask, "General Petraeus, what are you doing to reduce carbon emissions in the war on terror?" -- as the e-mail indicated -- but rather asked him whether the use of alternative energy sources could provide a more reliable and more secure power source for troops located in a faraway, unstable theater of operations, potentially relieving soldiers from having to defend vulnerable supply chains required to move conventional forms of energy. And that’s where the e-mail checked by Snopes.com ended. The version we received added new claims, including the parts about battlefield environmental impact statements and about Giffords urging American forces to club, rather than shoot, enemy forces. These comments were also absent from the transcript of the June 16, 2010, hearing. But we were able to track down the source: a July 17, 2010, post at the Arizona Conservative blog that was clearly labeled "Semi-News — A Satirical Look at Recent News." Here’s the entire satirical post: "Army’s ‘Carbon Footprint’ Taints War Effort "Representative Gabrielle Giffords (D-Az) took Afghan Commander, General David Petraeus, to task for what she characterized as ‘willful disregard of the environmental impact of our war effort.’ "‘There is no policy, no plan to minimize carbon emissions in our military activities,’ Giffords charged. ‘Bombs are dropped and bullets are fired without considering the environmental impact.’ "Giffords insisted that she was ‘not demanding an immediate halt to current military operations in the Middle East. I’m just saying that battle plans should include an environmental impact assessment as a regular part of the process before attacks are launched.’ "She also suggested that the Army ‘put more emphasis on less environmentally damaging methods, like stabbing or clubbing enemy forces in order to minimize the carbon output.’" In other words, the chain e-mailer cut and pasted the satirical post -- but, whether intentionally or accidentally, left out the crucial label "satirical." We reached out to two people who have posted or forwarded the item but did not hear back. So where does this leave us? In the hearing, Giffords did indeed raise an issue involving alternative energy with Petraeus, but it was not to express a concern that the military should "reduce carbon emissions in the war on terror" -- rather, it was to improve energy reliability and security for American forces on the ground. And the claims that Giffords urged American forces to club, rather than shoot, the enemy in order to reduce carbon emissions were pure satire but not labeled as such by the chain e-mailer. All told, the claims in the chain e-mail are ridiculous. So we rate this chain e-mail Pants on Fire! UPDATE: Shortly after we posted the story, the man who wrote the satirical post in July 2010 returned our e-mail. "I have been writing about 300 satirical pieces a year since 2005," said John Semmens. "Only once did I directly see one passed around as real news." Semmens said he has been contacted by journalists about a half dozen times over six years, so seeing one of his pieces circulate in this way strikes him as "a relatively unusual event."

pomt-11597	"After years of wage stagnation, we are finally seeing rising wages."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2018/jan/30/donald-trump/us-finally-seeing-rising-wages-donald-trump-said/	President Donald Trump touted economic achievements on his watch during his State of the Union address. One of the statistics he cited was wage growth. "After years of wage stagnation, we are finally seeing rising wages," Trump said. However, that’s problematic in two ways. We asked Jed Kolko, the chief economist at the jobs site Indeed.com, for the best measure to use, and he said it was median usual weekly real earnings for full-time wage and salary workers, 16 years and over. This is a measure that tends to reflect the typical wages of people with stable employment and it is adjusted for inflation. This figure has been calculated quarterly since 1979. Here’s the full run of the data: See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com This data shows that after Trump entered office, wages initially went up, then fell. For the fourth quarter of 2017, the figure was $345. That’s slightly below the $349 mark in the fourth quarter of 2016, before Trump entered office. Even if you allow for some quarterly blips, however, Trump’s statement is also misleading in another way. The "years of wage stagnation" he refers to didn’t end with Trump’s presidency -- wage growth began under President Barack Obama. Wages hit their post-Great Recession low in the second quarter of 2014, at $330. They climbed, with just a few blips, for the rest of his presidency. When we asked the White House for data, they said, incorrectly, that the most recent data was from the third quarter of 2017. The White House also offered another statistic: average real weekly earnings of all private-sector employees. For this statistic, wages have indeed risen since Trump has been in office — by less than 1 percent from December 2016 to December 2017. But here, too, wages rose over the equivalent periods of time in 2013, 2014, 2015 and 2016, in one case by as much as 2 percent over the course of a year. So it’s incorrect to say the United States is "finally" seeing wage increases. Our ruling Trump said, "After years of wage stagnation, we are finally seeing rising wages." By the most common measure, wages did go up for the first three quarters of Trump’s presidency, but they fell in the fourth, wiping out all the gains on his watch and then some. And even if you ignore this fourth quarter figure as a blip, his assertion ignores that wages — by two different measurements — began their climb during the final years of Obama’s presidency.

pomt-12447	"If you’re getting your insurance through (your employer), nothing changes" under Trumpcare.	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2017/may/11/rod-blum/iowa-gops-blum-gets-it-wrong-acha-effect-employer-/	Rep. Rod Blum, R-Iowa, faced a feisty crowd at a high school gymnasium in Dubuque when voters in his district pressed him on his vote for the House Republican health care bill, the American Health Care Act. Blum aimed to put the bill’s changes into perspective. "This bill, Trumpcare — whatever you want to call it — is about the individual market only," he said May 8. "That’s 12,000 people in my district. So if you’re in the group health insurance program through your employers, if you’re getting your insurance through the group health insurance, nothing changes." In this fact-check, we look at whether the House GOP measure changes nothing in employer-based plans. In reality, the bill does change the rules in a couple of ways that could affect employer plans. But the impact is far from certain. Core benefits One of the changes has to do with a key amendment authored by Rep. Tom MacArthur, R-N.J. It gives states the option to pick their own list of "essential health benefits," the services that every plan must provide. Under the Affordable Care Act, that list includes 10 services, from hospitalization to prescription drugs to pediatric care and more. Under the American Health Care Act, states could apply for waivers to drop some items from that list. Some common examples are maternity care or mental health, services that weren’t always part of insurance plans before the Affordable Care Act took effect. Blum’s spokesman Paul Smith told us it is wrong to focus on the MacArthur waivers. Blum "was speaking about the large-group market, not the small-group market where the MacArthur waivers could potentially apply," Smith said. Smith is correct that the amendment only addresses the individual and small-group markets. But that doesn’t settle the question. First, Blum spoke about employer-based insurance generally. The distinction between small- and large-group plans might have been lost on his audience. Yet even if he was thinking about large employer plans, which cover about 110 million people nationwide, health law analysts say the Republican bill could touch those plans and those people, too. The link between the list of benefits and financial protection The Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare, has two financial cushions for people. It bans annual and lifetime limits on coverage and requires insurance companies to put a cap on how much a person needs to pay out-of-pocket. In theory, no matter how big the medical bills get, they won’t drive someone into bankruptcy. The important thing is, both protections apply only to services on the essential benefits list. There’s another wrinkle. Companies that offer insurance through a large-group or a self-insurance plan are not required to provide every service on the essential benefits list, but for any item on that list that they do offer, those financial protections kick in. With that, we get to the significance of the MacArthur amendment. No one knows how many states will want to trim the essential benefits list, but the possibility could create some new options for the larger plans. "Employers could choose to base the plans they offer on a definition of essential health benefits that is considerably weaker than the current one," Matt Fiedler, a health studies fellow at the Brookings Institution, said. Fiedler said any service not on a state’s list is not subject to the financial protections of no yearly or lifetime limits. Health law professor Allison Hoffman at UCLA gave the hypothetical case of maternity and newborn care. "If the American Health Care Act becomes law, a state might define essential health benefits not to include maternity and newborn care," Hoffman said. "Then, an employer could once again cap them." Neither Fiedler nor Hoffman said that this would definitely happen; only that it could happen. Thomas Miller, a health law fellow at the market-oriented American Enterprise Institute, doesn’t argue the point. But Miller does downplay the significance. "It's not unusual for the first round of voting on bills with recently revised amendments to fail to connect and integrate fully with pre-existing law," Miller said. He described this intersection between the MacArthur amendment and current regulations, an "indirect bankshot" that has nothing to do with the amendment’s purpose or intent. Miller and Fiedler said the problem could be avoided through new regulations. End of the employer mandate Under the American Health Care Act, no one must buy insurance, nor do employers have to offer it. Fiedler called this change "clear and unambiguous." "The Congressional Budget Office projected that there would be a change in behavior," Fiedler said. The CBO didn’t look at the individual and employer mandates separately, but in its initial assessment of the House Republican bill, it said eliminating both would "substantially reduce the number of people with health insurance coverage." Miller noted that since large employers regularly offer insurance in order to compete for workers, keeping or ending the mandate would make little difference. Our ruling Blum said for people who get their insurance through their employer, the American Health Care Act changes nothing. The experts we reached said that there actually is a way that the GOP bill could affect employer plans. States could decide to trim the list of essential health services. Employers could still offer a fuller range of services, but the extra ones wouldn’t be subject to the rules that protect households against massive medical bills. No expert said this was certain to happen. Right now, it is a legal possibility. The end of the employer mandate also changes the rules for large employers, ending penalties for those that don’t offer insurance. But for different reasons, the impact is uncertain. Blum's statement is partially accurate but leaves out important information. We rate it Half True. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com Correction: A previous version of this story misspelled Dubuque.

pomt-02540	Says President Barack Obama has issued upwards of 1,000 executive orders, more than any modern president.	pants on fire!	/truth-o-meter/statements/2014/feb/06/chain-email/chain-email-claims-barack-obama-has-signed-1000-ex/	In his State of the Union address last month, President Barack Obama said he doesn’t intend to wait if Congress doesn’t move forward on his priorities in 2014. "I'm eager to work with all of you," Obama said Jan. 28. "But America does not stand still, and neither will I. So wherever and whenever I can take steps without legislation to expand opportunity for more American families, that's what I'm going to do." That means using his executive office — "I've got a pen and I've got a phone," he has taken to saying lately — to accomplish his agenda, if necessary. Republicans have lashed out in response, insisting Obama is overstepping his authority. Reps. Michele Bachmann, R-Minn., and Steve King, R-Iowa, even threatened to sue the president. We also saw an old chain email resurface claiming that Obama has already issued more executive orders than any of his predecessors. It first gained attention in the fall of 2012. "This president is determined to take control away from the House and Senate," the email says, while providing a tally of presidential executive orders from Teddy Roosevelt to Obama. The email claims Obama issued 923 executive orders in his first 3.5 years and "More than 1000+ and counting executive orders in six years." It goes on to list a handful of examples of Obama’s alleged work. (Read the chain email in its entirety.) As we dug into its claims, we found that pretty much everything about this email is wrong. And most of it was already debunked more than a year ago by our good friends at FactCheck.org. But several readers sent it to us again, and since the issue of executive authority has become newsworthy of late, we thought this deserved an update. By the numbers The tradition of executive orders dates back to our first president, George Washington, though it was used sparingly through the first 100 years of the union. Executive orders are official actions taken by the president directing the federal government and bureaucracies. They carry the power of law, but can be revoked or amended by future administrations and are limited in scope. For example, Obama cannot use executive orders to raise the minimum wage for the entire country, but he can (and plans to) raise the minimum wage for workers hired under new federal contracts to $10.10 an hour. The process picked up under Ulysses S. Grant, who issued 217 executive orders, nearly 140 more than his predecessor Andrew Johnson, who himself almost doubled Abraham Lincoln, the previous record holder. After Grant, it became commonplace for presidents to issue more than 100 executive orders. In fact, four presidents have eclipsed 1,000 executive orders: Teddy Roosevelt, Woodrow Wilson, Calvin Coolidge and Franklin Delano Roosevelt. (Notice Obama is absent from that list.) Franklin Roosevelt holds the record with 3,522 executive orders during his 12-plus years in office. But according to the chain email, FDR used his pen infrequently and issued a paltry 11 executive orders -- another inaccuracy. Here’s the incorrect tallies of presidential executive orders in the chain email versus the actual numbers, provided by the University of California Santa Barbara The American Presidency Project. President Executive orders according to chain email (false) Actual number of executive orders Franklin Roosevelt 11 3,522 Harry Truman 7 907 Dwight Eisenhower 2 484 John F. Kennedy 4 214 Lyndon Johnson 4 325 Richard Nixon 1 346 Gerald Ford 3 169 Jimmy Carter 3 320 Ronald Reagan 5 381 George H.W. Bush 3 166 Bill Clinton 15 364 George W. Bush 62 291 Barack Obama 1000+ 168* *As of Jan. 20, 2014 It’s obvious the chain email is way off. Not only is Obama far from the most prolific user of executive orders, at this point he’s not even on pace to surpass President George W. Bush’s total. In fact, unless he picks up speed, Obama will likely sign fewer executive orders than any two-term president since the start of the 20th century. Judging the acts That’s not the only part where the chain email invokes an alternate reality. It also lists 14 executive orders Obama signed that allegedly usurp traditional executive powers, including things like seizing control of the media, railroads, waterways and correctional institutions. The email invited us to "Feel free to verify the ‘executive orders’ at will." When we looked up the specific executive order numbers that the chain email mentioned, we found that they were all signed by other presidents. Also, those order numbers matched up with executive orders on either entirely different topics or orders that were much more limited in scope. Here's the rundown: Executive order number What the chain email claims it does What it actually does Who actually signed it No. 10990 Allows the government to take over all modes of transportation and control of highways and seaports. Created the Federal Safety Council in the Department of Labor to improve workplace safety for federal workers and civilian contractors Kennedy No. 10995 Allows the government to seize and control the communication media.

It also provides that when a state of emergency is declared by the President, Congress cannot review the action for six months. Adjusted emergency preparedness assignments to organizational and functional changes in Federal departments and agencies Ford As you can see by the table, none of these executive orders were signed by Obama. The first executive order Obama ever signed was No. 13489, far later than even the most recent executive order listed in the email (they count up). Many of the executive orders listed above deal with the Defense Protection Act passed by Congress in 1950 and reauthorized repeatedly since then. According to the Congressional Research Service, the act says "authorities can be used across the federal government to shape the domestic industrial base so that, when called upon, it is capable of providing essential materials and goods needed for the national defense." Obama has signed subsequent executive orders similar to the ones issued by Kennedy, Johnson and Ford that deal with emergency preparation, but they don’t create a state of martial law, like the email implies. The Congressional Research Service even said in 2000 that the Defense Protection Act "has nothing whatever to deal with martial law." Our ruling The chain email said Obama has issued more than 1,000 executive orders. That’s not even close. As of Jan. 20, 2014, he was at 168. The email also infers that Obama has far surpassed his predecessors in using his executive powers. That, too, is way off. FDR signed off on more than 3,500 executive orders, and, in fact, Obama is on pace to issue fewer executive orders than any two-term president since 1900. As for the 14 executive orders highlighted in the email? Obama didn’t issue any of them. They came from Kennedy, Johnson and Ford. Almost all of them have been revoked. Overall, the statements in this email seem to be completely made up. So we rate its claims Pants on Fire!	None	Chain email	None	None	None	2014-02-06T15:00:35	2014-02-02	['None']
pomt-07765	When it comes to protesters in Madison, "almost all" are now from outside of Wisconsin.	false	/wisconsin/statements/2011/feb/23/scott-walker/wisconsin-gov-scott-walker-says-out-staters-accoun/	Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker got right to the point when he was chatting Feb. 22, 2011, with a prank caller pretending to be a major Republican power-broker: The protests in Madison are dying down. And changing to mostly out-of-state residents. In the secretly-recorded call, Walker assured a New York blogger posing as industrialist David Koch -- a contributor to Walker’s campaign and many GOP causes -- that things were under control at the Capitol. "Well, we’re actually hanging pretty tough," Walker said in the call, which was taped and made public Feb. 23, 2011. "I mean, you know, amazingly there’s a much smaller group of protesters almost all of whom are in from other states today." We know Wisconsin is awful popular these days. And the battle over the budget-repair bill is national news. But are "almost all" of the protesters in from other states? We asked Walker spokesman Cullen Werwie about the not-intended-for-the-world-to-hear statement from his boss. He sent us two links to news stories from over the weekend -- one from the Weekly Standard, a conservative magazine, and another from the Decatur, Ill., newspaper. Here’s what the Feb. 21, 2011, blog post in the Weekly Standard said: "Labor groups and Democratic Party organizations from outside the state have been sending people to Madison for the demonstrations." It went on to note an e-mail from the Chicago Teachers Union, which said it was sending a bus Feb. 21, 2011, to Madison. The union’s twitter feed posted a message the evening of Feb. 19, 2011, saying: "CTU Supports Wisconsin Workers. Get on the bus Monday." Meanwhile, the Decatur paper reported Feb. 22, 2011 -- the day Walker made his comment during the non-Koch call -- that Illinois union leaders were sending protesters to Wisconsin. "A number of Illinoisans have headed to Madison in recent days to join the battle over Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker's effort to end collective bargaining for public employee unions," the paper reported. "The Illinois Education Association, the state's largest teacher union, reports it has sent 14 staff members to Wisconsin to help organize members in their fight," the story said. It went on to say another union -- Council 31 of the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees -- "has a number of staff members on the ground" and was sending a two bus loads on Feb. 22, 2011 and one on Feb. 23, 2011. OK, fair enough. That’s a few bus loads accounted for -- albeit not all on the day of Walker’s phone conversation. And, of course, there surely were other out-of-state protesters that day. But "almost all"? The crowds in Madison did drop on the day of the call. After several days of school district closings around the state due to teachers calling in sick to attend protests, the vast majority of teachers were back in the classroom. Milwaukee and Madison school districts reopened. We did a little more investigating to learn: Who are these protesters? Of course there’s no one checking ID cards, and no way to come up with a definitive percentage, but there are ways to gauge the makeup of such crowds. The Journal Sentinel has had reporters and photographers on the scene day and night since the protest began. We looked at dozens of pictures from protests Monday night and Tuesday, taken by Journal Sentinel photographers (You can see some of these pictures here.) We saw many signs and clothing that suggest Wisconsin protesters -- Badgers and Packers attire, a sign mentioning Janesville, signs mentioning the Madison teachers union and so forth. One man wore a T-shirt from the Shoe Box, a Madison-area store. However, that man, Thomas Brown, is from New Mexico. He came back to visit family near Madison. We won’t count him as an out-of-state agitator. We did see signs such as "Michigan Supports WI workers," and one that read "Coast to Coast Solidarity" that mentioned California and New York. On Feb. 23, 2011, when Teamsters President Jim Hoffa spoke, signs for Chicago Sheet Metal Workers were evident and there were Teamsters from other states present, according to news reports and Madison police. We sent a Patrick Tricker, a reporter for the UW-Madison The Daily Cardinal, through the crowd the afternoon of Feb. 23, 2011. It was day two of the state Assembly’s marathon vote on Walker’s measure, which involved hundreds of Democratic amendments. In an informal survey, Tricker spoke directly to 26 protesters in the Capitol rotunda. About a fourth of the 26 were from out of state, half from Madison and the remainder were from other parts of Wisconsin. He found one from California and one from Alaska. That’s nowhere near "almost all." Finally, we asked law enforcement for their take. "The vast majority of people protesting are from here -- Wisconsin and even more from Dane County," said Joel DeSpain, public information officer for the Madison Police Department. How would DeSpain know? "I grew up here," said DeSpain, who attended the University of Wisconsin-Madison and worked 25 years as a television journalist in that city before taking the job with the cops. "I know Madison, this is my town," DeSpain said he has seen friends, family members, people he has known for more than 30 years attending protests. The crowds on Feb. 22, 2011 -- the day of the Walker phone call -- included hundreds of state corrections officers and Madison police officers, he said. Said DeSpain: "Unless somebody’s giving them all sorts of t-shirts from Wisconsin" these are local protesters. Let’s bring this item home. In his not-so-private phone call, Walker claimed protests were getting smaller and almost all of the protesters at the state Capitol were there from out of state. Certainly there are folks there from far and wide. But there’s no evidence the out-of-towners have taken over. All evidence points to this being -- and remaining -- a home grown effort. We rate Walker’s statement False. Patrick Tricker of The Daily Cardinal contributed to this report.	None	Scott Walker	None	None	None	2011-02-23T19:03:07	2011-02-22	['Wisconsin', 'Madison,_Wisconsin']

pomt-09762	In the 1950s, "A lot of people got rich — and they had to pay a top tax rate of 90 percent."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/oct/02/michael-moore/michael-moores-film-capitalism-claims-richest-paid/	In his new film, Capitalism: A Love Story , Michael Moore makes a case that the richest Americans used to shoulder a much bigger portion of the tax burden back in the years of his childhood. In the 1950s, "A lot of people got rich — and they had to pay a top tax rate of 90 percent," Moore says in the film. Considering that the top marginal tax rate for the wealthiest Americans today is 35 percent, that figure seems astounding. But it's true that in the 1950s, the top marginal tax rates were over 90 percent. So does that mean that someone in 1955 making a half million dollars had to fork over $450,000 of it to Uncle Sam? No. We are talking here about "marginal" tax rates. Moore doesn't go out of his way to explain this, so we will. The marginal tax rate is the top rate of income tax charged to individuals on their last dollar of earnings. So in 1955, for example, when the top marginal tax rate was 91 percent, that was the tax rate owed on a person's income over $300,000. That person would, however, pay 20 percent on the first $2,000 of income; 21 percent on the next $2,000 in income; 24 percent on the next $2,000 and graduated on up to the highest rate. On average, a person making, say, $500,000 would pay substantially less than 90 percent of their income in federal taxes. The top marginal tax rates peaked in 1952 and 1953 at 92 percent for income over $300,000. Bob Williams of the Tax Policy Center did some math for us to give this some perspective. In 1952 and 1953, Williams said, when the top income tax rate was 92 percent for income over $300,000, a person would have to make waaaay more than $300,000 to actually end up paying an average of 90 percent of their income. According to Williams, someone would have to make $2,328,400, and therefore pay $2,095,560, to get to that 90 percent threshold. But people with income of less than $2.3 million — remember we're talking about 1952 and 1953 — would have paid, on average, something less than 90 percent, and perhaps much less. Still, Moore's point is valid. The top marginal tax rates paid by the richest Americans were far higher in the 1950s than they are now. In 2009, the top marginal rate was 35 percent on income above $372,958. And although Moore didn't use the term "marginal tax rate," he did say "top tax rate." People without CPAs might mistake that for a person's average tax rate (it's not), but it's valid wording. And so we rule this one Mostly True.

pomt-13831	"90% of rural women and 55% of all women are illiterate" in Morocco.	false	/global-news/statements/2016/jul/14/snapchat/snapchat-highlights-decades-old-data-part-michelle/	Factual claims are apparently now like Pokémon. They can be anywhere. We stumbled across an interesting factoid recently while flipping through a Snapchat story documenting First Lady Michelle Obama’s visit to West Africa and Morocco from June 27 to July 1. Obama just joined Snapchat, if you’re interested. Snapchats disappear, but we were able to grab a screengrab with a sobering claim about illiteracy rates among women in Morocco. The snap had the headline "Moroccan illiteracy" and said that "90% of rural women and 55% of all women are illiterate." Is that true? Or should this claim disappear right along with your Snapchat? We wanted to find out. Tracking the claim to its source The journey of this claim is particularly interesting, and shows the perils of how incorrect or outdated statistics can be repeated over and over. The snap cites as its source a blog post by Vital Voices, a non-profit that advances women’s causes around the globe. That actually is a reposting of an article from the IntLawGrrls website, a blog dedicated to discussion of international law and policy. The original IntLawGrrls post is from September 2011 and was written by Christie Edwards, the current director of international humanitarian law at the American Red Cross. Edwards claimed in her piece that "recent surveys in Morocco estimated the country’s illiteracy rate to be approximately 55 percent of all women. Fully 90 percent of rural women in Morocco are illiterate." Edwards’ blog cites a UNICEF table of statistics. But that table doesn’t correspond to her figures. The UNICEF table only lists an overall literacy rate of 74 percent for women 15-24 in Morocco (or an illiteracy rate of 26 percent). It makes no mention of illiteracy rates for a wider age range of women or for rural women specifically. So we asked Edwards where she got her data from. A spokeswoman told us the statistic actually comes from a 2004 USAID report on education in the Muslim world. That report includes, without citation, the following passage: "Literacy levels remain very low: 63 percent for men and 38 percent for women. Illiteracy is a particular problem for women in rural areas, where nine out of 10 women are illiterate." The claim that nine out of 10 rural Moroccan women are illiterate goes back even further, to a 1996 USAID resource request report that claims, "Women remain especially disadvantaged by low literacy (13% of rural women are literate)." So to recap, a 2016 Snapchat relies on a crosspost of a 2011 blog that erroneously cites UNICEF data when in fact it’s coming from a 2004 USAID report that is using a 1996 USAID resource request as is its foundation. If that sounds fishy, it is. Illiteracy in Morocco To find out the current illiteracy rate among Moroccan women, we examined public records maintained by UNESCO’s Institute for Statistics. The website’s profile on Morocco lists a literacy rate of around 62.05 percent for women aged 15 years and older in 2015, which translates to an illiteracy rate of 37.95 percent. (Correction: An earlier version of this fact-check listed a different percentage.) The database doesn’t give specific information about illiteracy for rural versus urban women. Leonardo Menchini, the head of the social inclusion section at UNICEF Morocco, shared the most recent data on illiteracy rates for urban and rural populations with PolitiFact. UNICEF’s data come from the 2014 Moroccan census. The takeaway: illiteracy remains an issue for females in Morocco, but not near the levels seen in the Snapchat. Our ruling A Snapchat story featuring First Lady Michelle Obama claimed that, in Morocco, "90% of rural women and 55% of all women are illiterate." That data is, in some cases, at least 20 years old -- way older than Snapchat. The claim cites old data from a report in 2004, that tracks back to a 1996 USAID request report. The most recent information from UNESCO and UNICEF indicate that Morocco’s illiteracy among women is still relatively high (60 percent in rural areas and 42 percent overall), but much lower than what the snap says.

pomt-11303	"The United States has a massive trade deficit with Japan. It's anywhere from $69 billion to a $100 billion a year."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2018/apr/19/donald-trump/donald-trump-correct-about-size-us-trade-deficit-j/	When President Donald Trump held a joint press conference with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe at his Mar-A-Lago resort, a Japanese journalist asked the leaders about trade between the two countries. Trump started his answer by saying, "The United States has a massive trade deficit with Japan. It's anywhere from $69 billion to a $100 billion a year. That's massive by any standpoint." When we took a closer look, we found that the lower end of Trump’s scale has some credibility, but not the upper end. First, let’s look at the data for trade in goods alone. (This is not the most complete look at trade — more on that later.) But the figure for goods alone is the one that trade skeptics are more apt to cite, because it is more likely to paint the United States as getting the short end of the stick in bilateral trade. U.S. Census Bureau data shows that the U.S. deficit with Japan in goods has been consistent in recent years, from $67 billion to $69 billion. In 2017, it was $68.8 billion. That figure is in line with the lower end of Trump’s range, but it’s well below the upper end of his range. In fact, the higher figure Trump offered is about 50 percent larger than the actual size of the deficit. There’s a more comprehensive figure that combines the deficit in goods and services. It makes Trump’s point more inaccurate. The United States tends to have a more favorable balance of trade in services, which includes sectors such as financial and insurance services, legal services, business consulting, and entertainment. Any goods-and-services deficit is usually smaller than the deficit in goods alone. According to Census Bureau data, the U.S. deficit with Japan in goods and services in 2017 was $56.1 billion. See Figure 2 on PolitiFact.com So Trump offered an upper estimate that’s almost twice as large as the actual goods-and-services deficit. Monica de Bolle, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, confirmed our conclusion that Trump’s upper-end estimate was off-base. "President Trump tends to get creative when speaking about bilateral trade deficits," she said. Trump called the trade deficit "massive." Let’s put it into context. The size of Japan’s goods-and-services deficit is far below that of China’s, and it’s also smaller than those of Mexico and Germany. But the deficit with Japan still ranks high on the list of deficits among top trading partners. See Figure 3 on PolitiFact.com The deficit with Japan is modest as a percentage of all trade between the two nations. The 2017 goods-and-services deficit with Japan amounted to 19.6 percent of total trade between the two countries. That was larger than the percentage for Mexico (11.1 percent), but it was smaller than for either Germany (28.5 percent) or China (47.4 percent). When we contacted the White House, they came up with identical data as we did — about $69 billion as a deficit in goods, but not as high as $100 billion. Our ruling Trump said, "The United States has a massive trade deficit with Japan. It's anywhere from $69 billion to a $100 billion a year." The U.S. trade deficit with Japan is roughly $69 billion if you only look at the trade in goods. A more comprehensive figure that includes the balance of trade in services is even smaller, $56.1 billion. Either way, the $100 billion that Trump threw out is unsupported by the data. We rate the statement Half True. CORRECTION: This version has corrected the size of the goods and services deficit with Japan. It is $56.1 billion, not $57.1 billion.

pomt-10010	"Warren (Buffett) still does support me."	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/mar/23/barack-obama/Warren-Buffett-still-backs-Obama/	The Oracle of Omaha is still for Obama. So the president claimed on 60 Minutes , interrupting interviewer Steve Kroft to tout the continued support of Warren Buffett, the Omaha-based stock-picker extraordinaire. "Your plan really for solving the banking crisis was met with very, very, very tepid response," Kroft said to Obama. "A lot of people said they didn't understand it. A lot of people said it didn't have any, enough details to solve the problem. I know you're coming out with something next week on this. But these criticisms were coming from people like Warren Buffett, people who had supported you, and you had counted as being your..." "And Warren still does support me," Obama interjected. "But I think that, understand, Warren's also a big player in the financial markets who's a major owner of Wells Fargo. And so he's got a perspective from the perspective of somebody who is part owner of a bank." Indeed Buffett, who endorsed Obama during the campaign, did explicitly say during a three-hour interview March 9 with CNBC that he still supports Obama. "I voted for Obama and I strongly support him, and I think he's the right guy," Buffett said early in the interview. Buffett did criticize Obama's handling of the banking crisis, saying that "a bank that's going to go broke should be allowed to go broke," as long as the depositors are protected. (Obama's approach has leaned toward giving the banks more bailout money in some form rather than letting them fail and having the government take them over.) But Buffett's primary concern was that Obama wasn't communicating clearly with the public about struggling banks. "The right answer for me (to the banking crisis) is the president to clarify things as only he can, because you have heard so many different things," he said. "He is the commander in chief on this, and it has to be clarified ... because if people aren't clear, they're going to be confused. And if they're going to be confused, they are going to be scared stiff. And that has to end." It's not surprising Buffett would want Obama to focus on the financial crisis — it has cost Buffett $25 billion. That's how much of his $62 billion fortune he lost in the past year, as shares of his holding company Berkshire Hathaway fell nearly 50 percent, Forbes reports. That knocked Buffett off his perch as the world's richest man, to No. 2 behind Bill Gates. Toward the end of the three-hour interview, Buffett reiterated his support for Obama. "He is the right president," Buffett said. "He's very, very smart. He's got, I think, exactly the right goals. He's articulate and I — you know, he will be the right person to be the commander in chief in this economic crisis." So clearly Obama was on solid ground touting Buffett's continued support.

pomt-10526	John McCain has "a consistent pattern of ducking important environmental votes."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/mar/04/sierra-club/he-was-campaigning-not-ducking/	In his bid for the Republican presidential nomination, Arizona Sen. John McCain hasn't shied away from citing his differences with Republican orthodoxy on the environment. On the campaign trail, for example, he's touted a Senate bill he is sponsoring to reduce carbon dioxide emissions to combat global warming. It's a bill that has won McCain lots of friends in the environmental movement. So it was something of a surprise earlier this month when Sierra Club executive director Carl Pope sent out a tough missive condemning McCain as an ally of corporate polluters. Urging Sierra Club supporters to write to their local newspapers to spread the word about McCain's poor environmental record in the Senate, Pope said McCain had "a history of siding with the polluters and special interests, and a consistent pattern of ducking important environmental votes." For this item, we'll focus on the allegation of ducked votes. As evidence, Pope cited a new study by the League of Conservation Voters examining crucial environmental votes taken in the Senate last year. Of the 15 votes the League studied, McCain was not present for any of them. Under the League's strict methodology – dating to the vote study's origins in the early 1970s – a missed vote counts as one against the environment. As a result, McCain's environmental support score for 2007 was zero percent, a point Pope stressed in his letter. "According to the scorecard, McCain was the only member of Congress to skip all 15 crucial environmental votes," he wrote. Pope didn't mention that the strict methodology also turned Illinois Sen. Barack Obama, the Democratic front-runner in the presidential race, from an environmental champion into one of the least environmentally friendly Democrats in the Senate. His score dropped from a 96 in 2005-2006 to 67 last year. The drop was almost entirely attributable to missed votes. New York Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton also suffered for missing votes. Her score dropped from 89 in 2005-2006 to 73 in 2007. The methodology is inherently unfair, says David Jenkins, a lobbyist for Republicans for Environmental Protection, a group that has endorsed McCain. He notes that McCain had a good excuse for missing votes: He was running for president against Republican challengers who had no similar commitments to keep them from the campaign trail, nor could McCain easily coordinate his absences with the Senate Majority leader, Harry Reid of Nevada, who schedules votes and was more accommodating to his Democratic colleagues, Clinton and Obama, according to Jenkins. For his part, McCain has never scored very high on the League's vote study. Still, his average grade of 44.3 from 2001-2006, before his current presidential campaign and after his previous one, is actually the third-highest score among Senate Republicans. And the League itself apparently doesn't think so poorly of McCain. In endorsing him for re-election in 2004, the group called him "a leader on global warming" and a "strong voice of reason" against a controversial plan to drill for oil in Alaska's Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. McCain, the League said, had also been a strong opponent of the Bush administration's energy policies, which have been widely condemned by environmentalists. Even Rob Smith, director of the Sierra Club's Arizona affiliate, says McCain — while he hasn't supported the group in all of its local campaigns — has been "a champion" when it comes to preserving forest land in Arizona and reducing noise pollution around the Grand Canyon. The case against the charge that McCain has "a consistent pattern of ducking important environmental votes," is clear cut. Indeed, McCain did miss 15 important environmental votes in 2007, while running for president. He also missed five environmental votes scored by the League in 1999, during his prior bid for the White House.

pomt-01210	Says "99 percent of the time police officers aren't charged when they kill young people of color."	half-true	/punditfact/statements/2014/nov/25/benjamin-crump/lawyer-ferguson-case-99-time-police-not-charged-de/	Even before the grand jury in Ferguson, Mo., announced its decision in the police shooting death of teenager Michael Brown, the lead lawyer for the Brown family challenged the grand jury process. Attorney Benjamin Crump said the ground rules were skewed in favor of police officer Darren Wilson. All one needed for proof, Crump said, was to look at the statistics. "The process is completely unfair," Crump said on ABC’s This Week on Nov. 23, 2014. "Ninety-nine percent of the time police officers aren't charged when they kill young people of color." We called Crump’s office to learn what statistics he relied on to back up his claim about 99 percent of police killings of minority youth. We did not hear back. We contacted a number of criminologists and other experts in fatalities at the hands of law enforcement officials. All of them told PunditFact that the data don’t exist to prove Crump right or wrong. At the same time, they said his number probably has a measure of accuracy, even if it doesn’t show what he thinks it does in terms of racial bias. Criminologist Candace McCoy at City University of New York said a simple fact dominates any assessment of Crump’s statement. "It is very rare for an officer to get indicted at all, no matter what the race of a victim," McCoy said. How rare is hard to pin down Ideally, we would know the number of police officers indicted for homicide of a person of color and the total number of people killed by police. We lack accurate figures for both. The closest we can get to the number of officers charged with homicide comes from Philip Stinson, a criminal justice researcher at Bowling Green State University in Ohio. Stinson looked at records from 2005 to 2011 and found that in those years, there were a total of 81 cases where at least one officer was charged with murder, nonnegligent manslaughter or negligent manslaughter. It’s important to note that this is a count of cases, not officers. You could imagine that a single death might involve more than one person from a law enforcement agency. While we could take 81 as a minimum figure, Stinson also told PunditFact he has no information on the race of the person who died. "I understand his (Crump’s) sentiment, and perhaps that is true historically," Stinson said. "But I don’t think there is any empirical research that would support his summary statistic of 99 percent." But let’s just say we took the 81 figure and compared it to the total number of deaths at the hands of law enforcement. That would give us some idea of how often an officer is charged when they kill someone. Unfortunately, we hit another data problem. There are two sources, the FBI and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and both undercount the number of people killed by police. There are many reasons. Top among them: Some reporting is voluntary, and often the person recording the death doesn’t even know whether an officer was involved. The consensus among experts is that the numbers are too low, but it’s unclear by how much. With that in mind, we find that the FBI’s Supplemental Homicide Reports show 2,695 justifiable homicides by law enforcement from 2005 to 2011. By definition, those are deaths in which officers followed the rules in using lethal force. If we add to that the 81 deaths to approximate the deaths that were not justified, we get 2,776. That would mean that officers are charged in about 3 percent of the cases when someone is killed. We went through a similar process with the CDC’s National Vital Statistics data and wound up with pretty much the same result. So when Crump said 99 percent of the time police are not charged in the killing of a person of color, he might have been in the ballpark. To flip his approach, he would be saying police are charged 1 percent of the time, while the flawed numbers we have say 3 percent -- regardless of race -- might be closer to the truth. But criminologist David Klinger at the University of Missouri-St. Louis said Crump’s claim about race is misleading. "Because it doesn’t include the all-important question, ‘Compared to what?’ " Klinger said. "If cops were routinely indicted in the wake of shooting old white guys, and they were only rarely getting indicted for shooting young people of color, he would be making a valuable point. That, however, is not that case." Criminologist Lorie Fridell at the University of South Florida echoes the thoughts of her peers. "Since officers are rarely charged in deadly force situations, that statistic, although not documented, is probably not too far off and would probably hold true for non-minority victims of police deadly force as well," Fridell said. The question of how often law enforcement officers are charged in the death of a young person of color is distinct from the debate over whether police are more likely to kill minorities than whites. There is a body of evidence that says blacks are more likely to be victims of lethal force than whites, but other analyses find a more complicated set of connections involving race, income, serious crime and policing strategies that make violent encounters between blacks and police more likely. Our ruling Crump said 99 percent of the time police officers aren’t charged when they kill a young person of color. With the caveat that police officers are rarely charged at all, the limited data and the opinions of criminologists back up Crump’s claim. But there is no hard data for either the number of police officers indicted for homicide of a person of color or for the total number of people killed by police, so we cannot say with certainty whether this happens 99 percent of the time. We rate the claim Half True.	None	Benjamin Crump	None	None	None	2014-11-25T11:46:52	2014-11-23	['None']

pomt-13625	Overdosing is now the number one accidental killer in our Commonwealth.	true	/pennsylvania/statements/2016/aug/11/josh-shapiro/surprising-stats-car-crashes-and-overdoses-pennsyl/	Pennsylvania’s heroin and prescription drug abuse crisis is one of the most acute problems facing the state, and the number of overdose deaths has skyrocketed in recent years. Sitting politicians and candidates for office are racing to propose solutions. Among them is Democrat Josh Shapiro, a Montgomery County commissioner and a candidate for attorney general who dedicated a page on his campaign website to fighting the opioid epidemic. But it was the stat he used at the beginning of his platform that caught our eye. "Overdosing," his campaign wrote, "is now the number one accidental killer in our Commonwealth." At first glance, it’s a stunning statistic. But this one checks out to be true, as drug overdose deaths have increased over the years while car crash deaths have been on the decline for decades. We took a look at the numbers to compare the leading causes of death in Pennsylvania and compare those to the number of deaths related to drugs. Drug overdose deaths have sharply risen in recent years. The most recent data shows that upwards of 3,500 people died of a drug overdose in Pennsylvania last year, representing a significant increase from 2014, according to a recent report released by the Pennsylvania State Coroners Association. Nearly 2,500 people died in Pennsylvania of a drug overdose in 2014, and Pennsylvania leads the nation in the number of drug overdose deaths among young men. A report released last summer by the Trust for America’s Health and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation put these figures into context: The number of deaths by drug overdose first surpassed car accidents in 2011, and the difference has only become more stark since then. Drug overdose deaths now surpass car accident deaths in 36 states. According to PennDOT, 1,195 were killed as a result of a motor vehicle crash in Pennsylvania in 2014, and the 2014 total of reportable traffic crashes is the fourth lowest total since 1950. (PennDOT defines a crash as one in which an injury or a fatality occurs or at least one of the vehicles involved requires towing from the scene.) That means that in 2014, drug overdoses represented double the number of deaths compared to motor vehicle crashes in Pennsylvania and is by far the leading accidental cause of death in the state. Though drug overdose data is available for 2015 and 2014, the most comprehensive data with regard to the reason for all deaths in the state is from 2013. The Pennsylvania Department of Health reported that in 2013, 4,891 people died of an "accident" -- a category that includes drug overdoses. Of those, the Center for Disease Control reports 2,426 were drug overdoses. In 2013, 1,965 people died from an accident that wasn’t a drug overdose or in a vehicle while 1,313 people were killed as a result of a car accident. But it’s important to note: Drug overdoses are the No. 1 form of accidental death in Pennsylvania, not the No. 1 overall reason for death. That’s heart disease, followed by cancer and chronic lower respiratory disease. In addition to illnesses and accidents, there were 630 homicides in Pennsylvania in 2013. Here’s a look at the top five causes of death in the commonwealth in 2013: Heart disease - 31,537 Cancer - 28,418 Chronic lower respiratory disease - 6,702 Cardiovascular disease - 6,575 Total accident deaths (including drug overdoses) - 4,891 The opioid addiction and drug overdose problem is increasing the most in 1. Rural areas of Pennsylvania ravaged by addiction to prescription drugs and 2. In Philadelphia, which had the highest drug-related death rate per 100,000 people in 2014. That year, 655 people died of a drug overdose in Philadelphia and heroin was present in 349 of those deaths. According to a report by the Drug Enforcement Agency, the increasing abuse of heroin and cocaine as well as opioids like fentanyl and oxycodone caused the spike in drug overdoses in the city over the last decade. There was a 33 percent increase in drug-related deaths in Philadelphia between 2013 and 2014 alone. Susquehanna, Cambria, Fayette and Wayne counties round out the top five counties in the state where drug overdose deaths have increased most rapidly. Our ruling Attorney General candidate Josh Shapiro wrote in his campaign platform for fighting the opioid epidemic in Pennsylvania that "Overdosing is now the number one accidental killer in our Commonwealth." Data from The Department of Health, the Center for Disease Control and the several other independent reports shows that overdosing has surpassed car crashes and other accidental causes as the leading accidental cause of death in Pennsylvania.

pomt-03768	"75 percent of the (air traffic control) towers the Obama Administration is closing are located in Republican Congressional Districts."	false	/wisconsin/statements/2013/apr/03/jim-sensenbrenner/rep-f-james-sensenbrenner-says-75-percent-closed-a/	Dozens of small airports around the country were touched by federal budget cuts under a decision announced March 22, 2013, by the Federal Aviation Administration. A total of 149 air traffic control towers operated by private contractors will be shut down, the agency decided. The decision was one of the most high profile and broad based actions to come under the politically charged sequestration cuts. Eight Wisconsin airports are on the list, including Crites Field in Waukesha, which lies in the district of U.S. Rep. F. James Sensenbrenner (R-Menomonee Falls). Sensenbrenner issued a news release March 22, 2013, criticizing the FAA decision, saying the "contract towers" save money and have fewer safety problems. He also noted that the FAA’s budget was being cut 5 percent, but the spending for the contract towers was dropping 75 percent. Sensenbrenner added: "Not coincidentally, 75 percent of the towers the Obama Administration is closing are located in Republican Congressional Districts." Critics have said the administration is playing politics with the budget cuts. But Sensenbrenner’s claim was one of the first we’ve seen that quantified this complaint. Are 75 percent in GOP districts? We asked the congressman’s office for evidence to support his claim. That’s when we started to feel some turbulence. "That information came from a member of the aviation subcommittee," responded Sensenbrenner spokesman Ben Miller in an email. We asked him to be more precise about the source of the claim and the actual number. Three days after our initial inquiry, Miller responded: "We have reissued the press release noting the correction. I appreciate you pointing it out." Wait a minute. We didn’t offer a correction. We only asked a question. The reissued news release carried the notation "updated," and this information: "(A statistic in the previous release was unverifiable)." Miller elaborated in an email: "We received (the statistic) from the office of a member on the Aviation subcommittee and are unwilling to throw anyone under the bus. We couldn’t verify the statistic we received and therefore issued a retraction. Unfortunately, Rep. Sensenbrenner is unavailable for an interview today." Still curious on the number, we started searching, emailing and mapping. Sensenbrenner’s claim was repeated in several news accounts of his reaction to the budget cuts, including on Fox News and in the Janesville Gazette. (Milwaukee Journal Sentinel coverage did not include the claim.) We did come across a similar claim from another House member, U.S. Rep. Joe Pitts (R-Penn.). "Two out of every three towers slated for closure are in Republican Congressional districts," Pitts said in a March 7, 2013 news release. "Unfortunately, this political game has real implications for public safety." The statement by Pitts, who is not a member of the aviation subcommittee, came before the FAA announced its final tower closing list. At the time, there was a preliminary list of 189 airports. Pitts, whose district includes one of the airports, did some analysis of that preliminary list, said spokesman Andrew Wimer. "We had some of our interns here look up some of the ZIP codes," of the affected towers and then cross referenced that information with congressional districts, Wimer said. The result: Just under 66 percent were in Republican districts, Wimer said. Wimer declined to release the data, and he would not say what the survey results say about the final closing list. So we’re on our own to test Sensenbrenner’s claim. We plotted the 149 towers set for closure on a map. And then we cross referenced by party with congressional districts. Of the 149 airports slated for closure, four fall inside two separate congressional districts. Of those four, two sit in two Republican districts while the other two straddle a Republican and a Democratic district. Eighty-four (58 percent) of the remaining airports fall squarely inside Republican districts while 61 (42 percent) are in Democratic districts. The overall breakdown of the House is 234 Republicans to 201 Democrats, which means Republicans have about 54 percent of the seats. There is another factor at play: Many of the affected airports are in less-populated rural areas that tend to lean Republican. Let’s land this item. Arguing politics were involved in the FAA’s tower closing decision, Sensenbrenner said 75 percent of the towers set to close were in Republican districts. Three days after we asked about it, Sensenbrenner removed the claim and, in at least in one version of the statement, included a note saying a previous version relied on "unverifiable" information. It would have been more accurate to say that the statement was unverified. We verified the numbers. And we rate the statement False.

pomt-07515	In Florida, it’s not illegal for an immediate family member of state officials to prosper from legislation supported by a spouse.	true	/florida/statements/2011/apr/08/broward-county-medical-association/group-claims-it-not-illegal-florida-spouse-benefit/	From appointing state health agency heads to proposing how much funding state-run health care programs should receive, Gov. Rick Scott has some major influence over the state's medical industry. It's that influence coupled with Scott's former business dealings in health care that has at least one group of Florida physicians concerned that Scott could potentially peddle legislation that would benefit a fast-growing urgent-care clinic company he co-founded. On March 31, 2011, the board of directors of the Broward County Medical Association convened for its monthly meeting, where one of the items up for discussion was how Scott's position might benefit Solantic Corp. -- a chain of 32 walk-in clinics Scott helped found in 2001. Before taking office in January 2011, Scott transferred his $62 million worth of shares in the company into a trust under his wife's name. Scott said that by doing so, he was free of any future conflicts of interest. "As I've told you, I'm not involved in that company," Scott was quoted as saying in the St. Petersburg Times in an April 2, 2011, article about why he didn't sell his shares instead. Still, for the 20-member board of the Broward Medical Association, Scott handing over his shares to his wife did not address concerns that his actions as governor could potentially benefit Solantic. So the board unanimously agreed to issue a resolution. "It is a conflict of interest for the governor (or any government official) to have his immediate family own urgent-care centers or clinics and for them to benefit financially from government health care reform," read the resolution, according to an e-mail provided by the group's president, Dr. Aaron Elkin. The association represents 1,500 allopathic and osteopathic physicians of all specialties, according to its website. The association then sent out notice of the resolution with the following statement: "Gov. Scott transferred his ownership interest in Solantic to a trust owned and managed by his wife. Solantic has contracts with Medicaid HMOs. Their volume of patients will likely increase if/when Medicaid Reform is expanded statewide. Gov. Scott's wife sits on the Solantic board. Florida is one of the few states where that arrangement (an immediate family member may prosper from legislation supported by their spouse) is not illegal." We wondered if the last part of the statement was true. Does Florida have no laws banning a state officer from supporting legislation that would benefit an immediate family member? What Florida law says First, we turned to Florida statutes and the Florida Commission on Ethics to see what the law spells out in cases where an immediate family member’s finances could potentially cause a conflict of interest. Kerrie Stillman, spokeswoman for the Florida Commission on Ethics, said she couldn't comment on Scott's potential conflict of interest but directed us to the provisions of the law that might be relevant. The issue of "misuse of public position" is addressed in Florida Statute 112.313. The law reads: "No public officer...shall corruptly use or attempt to use his or her official position or any property or resource which may be within his or her trust, or perform his or her official duties, to secure a special privilege, benefit, or exemption for himself, herself, or others." When it comes to business dealings, the same statute says that a public officer shall not "either directly or indirectly purchase, rent, or lease any realty, goods, or services for his or her own agency from any business entity" in which the officer, his or her spouse or child is an officer, partner, director or proprietor or has a "material interest." As long as Solantic is not doing business directly with the governor's office, then Scott is technically not violating those provisions, said Mark Herron, a Tallahassee attorney specializing in ethics and government affairs. Herron also previously served on the Florida Commission on Ethics. "His agency is the Executive Office of the Governor, it’s not the Agency for Health Care Administration, the Department of Health, the Department of Elder Affairs, etc.," Herron said. "From a strict reading of those provisions, he doesn’t have any conflicting interests as long as Solantic is not doing business with the Executive Office of the Governor." While Scott does not have a vote in legislative matters -- only the ability to propose or veto legislation -- it's worth noting that even other state lawmakers can still vote on an issue, even if there is a potential conflict of interest. Florida Statute 112.3143 provides that "no state public officer is prohibited from voting in an official capacity on any matter." The statute goes on to clarify that should there be a potential conflict of interest, such as a "special private gain or loss of a relative or business associate," the elected official has 15 days after the vote occurs to "disclose the nature of his or her interest as a public record in a memorandum file filed with the person responsible for recording the minutes of the meeting." In contrast, on the municipal and county level, the same statute gives a different set of instructions. Should a conflict of interest arise, officials have to abstain from voting on the measure, and publicly announce at the meeting why they aren't voting. They also have 15 days to file a memorandum with the clerk or whoever is recording meeting minutes. Herron said that when the state’s initial ethics laws were passed in 1975, both local and state governments were held to the same standard. But the provisions for municipal and county officials were changed in 1984 because lawmakers felt local elected officials have more day-to-day dealings with approving and entering into contracts. A measure working its way through the Legislature this year seeks to hold all state officers to the same standard as local and county officials when it comes to voting on items where there may be conflicts of interest. Blind trusts The issue of where to place a governor's financial holdings to avoid a potential conflict of interest has been around long before Scott -- whose reported net worth is $218 million -- took office. During two terms as governor, Jeb Bush, whose net worth coming into office was close to $2 million, held his assets in a blind trust, according to the St. Petersburg Times. A blind trust is one in which the owner hands over power of attorney to someone else, and has no right to intervene in the holdings of the trust. Gov. Charlie Crist likewise placed his assets in a revocable trust, according to the Times. That's similar to a blind trust in that you’re handing over the daily decisions about assets to someone else, but there is still an opportunity to chime in on the management of the assets. For the 2011 legislative session, Republican Sen. Mike Fasano has revived a bill he first sponsored in 2007 that would require the governor and other elected officials to place their financial assets in a blind trust. We called Scott's office to get his take on the concerns that, by transferring his Solantic shares to his wife’s trust, he had not eliminated the potential for a conflict of interest, but we did not hear back. Still, when Scott was pressed again on the subject of potential conflicts of interest with Solantic at an economic forum in West Palm Beach on April 4, 2011, he told the Palm Beach Post: "That company will not be doing business with the state, and I've told everybody all along, hold me accountable for that." However, even if Solantic does not do business with the state in an official capacity, the company can still accept payments through state workers compensation programs and Medicaid HMO plans. For example, people covered by state-run programs may visit a Solantic clinic as a personal decision. According to figures provided by Solantic CEO Karen Bowling to the Palm Beach Post and St. Petersburg Times, the company received $110,657 from the state in 2010, and $20,061 so far in 2011 -- mainly for providing employment-related physicals and workers' compensation cases. "Even when we cast the governor's actions in the best light possible and presume his compliance with the relevant Florida voting conflict and disclosure of financial interests statutes, his indirect but real financial interests in the current trust creates an appearance of impropriety from a reasonably objective public perspective," said Tony Alfieri, director of the Center for Ethics and Public Service at the University of Miami School of Law. Our ruling The medical association's resolution criticizes Scott for a conflict of interest, but its e-mail announcing the resolution concedes it is not illegal in Florida for an immediate family member of a state officer to prosper from legislation supported by their spouse. So back to our question: Is it legal? Provisions in Chapter 112 of the Florida Statutes allow state lawmakers to vote on issues that might benefit family members so long as they disclose the relationship after the vote. Scott may propose health-care legislation and budgets and appoint health-care officials, but he's not a lawmaker. Solantic clinics benefit from doing routine medical work paid for through state programs, such as Medicaid or workers' comp exams, but Scott has said repeatedly that Solantic will not officially do business with the state. "From the point of view of complying with the strict definition of the law, he appears not to have violated any of the provisions," Herron said. "But, as everyone has noted, there may be a higher standard than a legal standard to be held to." The legal standard is the one we're fact-checking. We rate this claim True.

pomt-02692	The federal health care law tells "the American people precisely what type of coverage they have to have."	half-true	/punditfact/statements/2014/jan/05/mitt-romney/mitt-romney-obamacare-tells-people-precisely-what-/	Mitt Romney may no longer be a presidential candidate, but he remains a vocal critic of President Barack Obama, particularly Obama’s health care law. During an appearance Jan. 5 on Fox News Sunday, the Republican and former Massachusetts governor weighed in on the Affordable Care Act as it enters an important year of the rollout. "It's not just that the president tells people that they have to buy health insurance; it's that he tells them what health insurance they have to buy," Romney said. "The idea that the government knows better than the American people what kind of insurance they have to have makes no sense, and it's something ... I think the American people are rejecting in large numbers." Romney put it more succinctly later in the program when he said that the federal health care law tells "the American people precisely what type of coverage they have to have." This issue came up quite a bit toward the end of 2013, when millions of Americans discovered their current health insurance policies did not meet minimum standards for coverage required by the law. But is it fair to say the federal government is telling Americans what insurance they have to buy and dictating the type of coverage they must own? For insurance sold on the individual market — i.e. plans purchased individually and not through an employer — there are requirements of what’s included in a policy. The administration calls them the 10 "essential health benefits." They are: Ambulatory patient services Emergency services Hospitalization Maternity and newborn care Mental health and substance use disorder services Prescription drugs Rehabilitative and habilitative services and devices Laboratory services Preventive and wellness services and chronic disease management Pediatric services Plans sold in the individual markets must meet those requirements. That means some people who aren’t thinking about having children — or can’t have children — will still need to purchase coverage for maternity care and pediatric services. Others who don’t regularly rely on prescription drugs will still pay for a plan that includes it. Critics, such as Romney, say this requires people to pay for coverage they don’t need or want. Proponents say the alternative (a.k.a. pre-Obamacare) was an individual market where people were often paying for plans that actually provided very little coverage and the new law sets minimum standards. And, like plans purchased through your employer, requiring everyone to pay for certain coverage, even if they don’t need it, will spread the risk around and keep the cost lower for everyone. In practice, it means fox example that men and women will pay the same rates for equivalent coverage, and women won't be charged more because they can have children. The 10 essential health benefits apply to any plan that has not been grandfathered into the law. In practice, that includes all of the plans purchased in the individual markets offered by the federal government or states. It also includes any businesses with 50 or more full-time employees who previously did not offer insurance to their workers (Obama delayed the employer mandate until 2015). To be clear, there’s still choice in the individual market. While there are minimum coverage requirements regardless of the policy, 95 percent of consumers who buy insurance on the federal marketplace will have a choice between options offered by two or more insurance providers. In the 36 states where the federal government is running or assisting the marketplace, the average consumer has a choice between 53 health insurance options. Those choices range from less costly catastrophic insurance for younger adults to the higher-tiered bronze, silver and gold plans. Consumers can choose to pay more for more coverage and benefits. So Romney is right that the health insurance law is mandating some type of coverage, but he’s exaggerating as to the extent. That’s even more true for Americans who already receive their health insurance through an employer. Their plans are not required to offer the 10 essential benefits if they were in place before March 2010, though they are required to make some more minor changes. One of them requires insurers to spend at least 80 percent of someone’s premium on patient care. Employers also cannot significantly decrease the benefits, or risk losing grandfathered status, but they can make changes. (For the record, individual plans also can avoid the 10 essential benefits if they are considered grandfathered under the law. That’s easier said than done, however, and prompted the cancellations letters that came out last year. Obama has asked that some old, expiring plans remain on the books one more year before transitioning out.) Our ruling Romney said the administration is telling "the American people precisely what type of coverage they have to have." We were unable to reach Romney. The health care law does mandate some types of coverage, and for some people, requires 10 essential health benefits. But it’s not nearly as sweeping as Romney makes it sound.

pomt-13649	Says Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton are "responsible for leading America into a deal that will arm Iran."	half-true	/north-carolina/statements/2016/aug/05/richard-burr/nc-sen-richard-burr-says-nuclear-deal-will-arm-ira/	The United States is the world’s largest arms dealer, but Iran is one country the government usually doesn’t like doing business with. Yet on the heels of a Wall Street Journal article on connections between the Iran nuclear deal, prisoner swaps and $400 million in cash being secretly flown to that country, Republican U.S. Sen. Richard Burr of North Carolina said President Obama and Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton paved the way for Iran to expand its military strength. "The administration, including President Obama and Secretary Clinton, is responsible for leading America into a deal that will arm Iran, the number one state sponsor of terrorism," Burr said in a press release Wednesday. Previous PolitiFact articles have found it’s False to say the Iran deal will allow Iran to arm itself with nuclear weapons, since it actually does the opposite. But Burr made a broader statement, saying the deal "will arm Iran" in general, with no specific mention of nukes. We wondered if that, too, was wrong. Burr, the chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, is seeking re-election to a third term in the Senate. He faces Democratic challenger Deborah Ross. A nuclear armed Iran? Iran was within two or three months of building eight to 10 nuclear weapons before the deal was signed in July 2015, according to the Obama administration. The deal forced destruction or removal of nuclear equipment and the loss of 97 percent of Iran’s enriched uranium. Iran also had to promise never to build or buy a nuke. For a good refresher on the deal, see PolitiFact’s "6 things to know about the Iran deal." It will be allowed to enrich uranium again starting in a decade, but only for research and power plants. International inspectors will be tasked with ensuring it’s not enriching uranium more than 3.67 percent. Approximately 90 percent enrichment is necessary to make a bomb. And even after some restrictions sunset (others never do), wrote Brookings Institution senior fellow Richard Nephew, Iran will still be subject to other nuclear treaties – and violations "permit the United States and its partners to respond with a range of options, up to and including the use of military force." Non-nuclear weapons Burr’s spokesperson, Taylor Holgate, told us Burr really meant that the Iran deal gives the pariah nation more money and access to buy other, non-nuclear weapons. "With more resources including access to global markets and this most recent injection of $400 million, Iran will continue and even grow its nefarious efforts via its military and proxies in the region," Holgate said. Like with nukes, the Iran deal does not literally arm Iran with conventional weapons either. No one sent weapons to Iran in exchange for giving up its nuclear work. But since Burr’s office clarified his remarks as being about about money, we’ll take a look at that, too. As part of the deal, countries that had frozen Iranian-owned bank accounts will release that money. Estimates range from $56 billion to $150 billion, plus the $400 million from the U.S. that inspired Burr’s original claim. That’s enough money to buy some serious military gear. Unfortunately for Iran, it can’t. The nuclear deal did not lift a worldwide embargo on selling such weapons as helicopters, tanks, artillery and missiles to Iran. That is set to remain in effect until October 2020, said Arms Control Association nonproliferation policy director Kelsey Davenport. She said the embargo could be lifted before then if inspectors think Iran is following the terms of the deal. But the U.S. and other world powers can put the embargo back in place. "It can be snapped back into place by the (United Nations) Security Council through 2025 if one of the states party to the deal believes that Iran is violating the agreement," she said. Clinton’s role in the nuclear deal Burr attacked Clinton for the Iran deal, although it was actually her successor as Secretary of State, John Kerry, who finalized the deal. Clinton had been out of office more than two years by the time the U.S., Iran, China, Russia, France, Germany and United Kingdom signed it. However, that doesn’t mean Burr is wrong for including Clinton. She has claimed responsibility for the deal, too. "I spent 18 months putting together the sanctions against Iran so that we could force them to the negotiating table," Clinton said previously. PolitiFact rated that Mostly True. Experts believe sanctions from her time in office did help bring Iran to the table, but so did sanctions passed both before and after her tenure. A separate settlement Burr’s statement attacking Clinton and Obama referenced a $400 million payment the U.S. reportedly made to Iran in January that the Wall Street Journal reported recently. However, that payment was made under Kerry, not Clinton. It was the first installment of a $1.7 billion settlement over a failed 1979 arms deal. The U.S. took $400 million for a delivery of fighter jets but never sent them or gave back the cash after Islamic revolutionaries overthrew the king, who had himself consolidated power in a 1953 CIA-sponsored coup. Burr and his spokesperson both referenced that January payment as something that could help Iran buy weapons. However, the Wall Street Journal also quoted CIA Director John Brennan saying the U.S. is monitoring the money. There was no mention of concerns over military spending. "The money, the revenue that’s flowing into Iran is being used to support its currency, to provide moneys to the departments and agencies, build up its infrastructure," Brennan reportedly said. Our ruling Sen. Richard Burr said that Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton are "responsible for leading America into a deal that will arm Iran." That’s not true in a strictly literal sense, except for the fact that Obama and Clinton (and John Kerry) are responsible for the Iran deal, along with Iran, Russia, China, France, Germany and the United Kingdom. Iran is not being given any weapons, and in fact it is giving up some very powerful weapons it was on the verge of developing. However, if Iran plays by the rules, it will have access in the future to weapons dealers and to billions of dollars in cash that it can’t legally access now. There’s no guarantee it will happen, but it will if everything goes according to plan. Essentially, the deal does not arm Iran but could allow Iran to better arm itself. We rate this claim Half True because it’s partially accurate but leaves out important details. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/a847c865-1a11-4e90-8090-fa9a6d8ebd8b	None	Richard Burr	None	None	None	2016-08-05T18:48:57	2016-08-03	['Iran', 'United_States', 'Hillary_Rodham_Clinton']
pomt-03742	"Congresswoman Frederica Wilson successfully postpones closure of the North Perry airport tower."	mostly false	/florida/statements/2013/apr/10/frederica-wilson/frederica-wilson-says-she-stopped-broward-airport-/	When the budget sequester started in March, the Federal Aviation Administration announced that it would soon shutter 149 airport towers nationwide. Enter U.S. Rep. Frederica Wilson, the South Florida Democrat best known for her sequined hat and matching ensembles. Wilson is also famous for her passion -- whether speaking out for inner city children, Haitian refugees, or, in this case, air traffic controllers facing layoffs. On April 4, Wilson held a press conference to protest the threatened closing of the North Perry airport in Pembroke Pines. Wilson gave a rousing speech -- sometimes over the noise of airplanes flying overhead -- against the FAA’s plan. Wilson said fighting the sequester was "the civil rights movement of 2013 ... It's going to hurt people, people will die, people will suffer, people will lose their homes, people will lose their tax break." The next day, the FAA announced that it would delay closures slated for Florida and other states until June 15. Lots of politicians expressed relief including U.S. Reps Lois Frankel, D-West Palm Beach, and C.W. Bill Young, R-Indian Shores. But Wilson’s press statement had a different tenor: she took credit for the FAA’s decision though only for the airport in Pembroke Pines: "Congresswoman Frederica Wilson successfully postpones closure of the North Perry airport tower," announced the headline. The press release continued: "Following the Congresswoman’s month-long campaign to save the tower, which included fact finding, speeches, official requests, and legislation, Congresswoman Wilson was notified, this morning, by FAA officials that the tower had been granted a temporary reprieve from closure...." There is no dispute that Wilson fought the closure and a day after her press conference, the FAA announced the closure delay. But should she get credit here for prompting the FAA to act? The lawsuits against the FAA Soon after the FAA made its announcement in March that it intended to close airports, the airports began filing lawsuits. About 20 were filed and plaintiffs argued that the closures would jeopardize safety. The clock was ticking: Closures were set to start April 7, prompting lawyers to start filing emergency motions. We interviewed Peter Kirsch, an attorney who represents multiple plaintiffs. He said plaintiff lawyers from three firms had conference calls with federal officials on April 5. The lawyers reached an agreement in the early afternoon and that led to the FAA’s announcement that it would delay closures until June 15, Kirsch said. "The FAA decision was part of an agreement among the lawyers that the FAA would delay the closure date if we would agree to withdraw our emergency motion for a stay, which is like a preliminary injunction or restraining order," Kirsch told PolitiFact Florida. On Friday afternoon, the FAA issued a press release stating that it was delaying tower closures nationwide. "This additional time will allow the agency to attempt to resolve multiple legal challenges to the closure decisions." Kirsch said several factors were pressing on FAA administrators. "I think they recognized that they would not accomplish the closure of these towers in an orderly fashion .... There is no question that this particular dispute, this battle is being played out administratively, being played out in courts, and being played out in Congress. No one of those is independent of the others." Airport officials told PolitiFact Florida that they were stunned at the speed that the FAA was attempting to move. When an airport has a modest construction project, the FAA requires a safety plan that can take six months to complete, said Lawrence Krauter, chief executive officer of an airport in Spokane, Wash., that filed one of the lawsuits. But due to the sequester, the FAA was attempting to pull off a major nationwide change even faster. That the FAA wasn’t ready to pull this off was evident in a conference call between the FAA and airport officials nationwide less than a week before the closures were slated to start. The FAA couldn’t answer basic questions about the timing of closures and procedures for local airports taking over, Krauter told PolitiFact. "I don’t think there was enough time that the FAA could respond to all of those things. I think they made good decision step back," Krauter said. "I think that call was pivotal in establishing there were some fundamental issues and there wasn’t time to coordinate." Wilson on tower closures and sequestration Shortly after she issued her press release on April 5, we spoke to Wilson by telephone to ask why she was taking credit. Wilson said she spoke with Roderick Hall, FAA Assistant Administrator for Government and Industry Affairs, about the cuts that morning after the FAA had threatened to lock the North Perry tower if Broward didn’t sign an agreement. "We gave them a threat," Wilson said. "The threat was if they came to shut the tower down I would personally be there to stop them. ... I told him I am a protester of the civil rights movement. He said, ‘Congresswoman I am aware of your advocacy."’ She said Hall called back later in the day and told her about the decision to delay the closures. "He said ‘Congresswoman go ahead, you can take the credit. It's from pressure, pressure pressure from Congresspeople like yourself," Wilson said. "He didn’t mention anything about lawsuits." Hall didn’t respond to messages we left on his cellphone, and the FAA pointed us to their press release that didn’t mention Wilson or congressional pressure. Four members of Wilson’s staff, including legislative director Justin Talbot Zorn, joined PolitiFact Florida on a conference call Monday to explain why they believe Wilson deserved the credit. Wilson’s staff said that from the moment she learned about the closures at North Perry and Opa-Locka she had fought them and sent two letters to the FAA protesting their plan. Then she held the press conference Thursday, April 4. On Friday, Wilson’s office was contacted by Kent George, Broward County’s aviation director. George’s staff had received an agreement from the FAA Thursday night. The FAA gave the county a deadline of 3 p.m. to sign the agreement, though George said it wasn’t clear why the FAA wanted to charge $5,280 a month. (The county had a separate agreement to pay the workers.) "They said if the agreement wasn’t signed they intended to change the locks on the tower at midnight on the 6th," George told PolitiFact. That’s when George’s office contacted local members of Congress. Wilson got on the phone with Hall to protest the closure and "he said he see what he could do by 3 p.m," Zorn said. Hall called back later that afternoon, said Zorn, who was in on the call with Wilson and recounted it for PolitiFact. "This second call, he said, ‘Thank you so much for your call this morning. We understand how important this is and how passionate you are about this. I have good news for you...’ " he said. Then Hall told Wilson about the delay. "So you can claim this as a win. You can take as much credit as you want to take for this." The scope of the phone call was only about North Perry -- Hall didn’t discuss the lawsuits or the FAA’s nationwide decision. So Wilson did take credit for North Perry and issue the press release. Pressure from Congress We can’t be certain exactly what was said between Hall and Wilson but even if we assume that he did give her the sense that she could take credit, does it seem reasonable that Wilson’s pressure caused the FAA’s decision? By that Friday, the FAA was facing lawsuits nationwide and protest letters from politicians across the country. Airport officials we interviewed say bipartisan congressional pressure could have played a role, but there is no dispute that the litigation was the driving force. "I think the litigation, I think the media coverage, as you know, was pretty intensive, and certainly calls and letters from Congress have an impact on any federal agency," said Spencer Dickerson, president of the American Association of Airport Executives, which sued the FAA said. Our ruling In a press release Wilson took credit for the FAA’s decision to postpone closing an airport tower in her district. "Congresswoman Frederica Wilson successfully postpones closure of the North Perry airport tower," stated the headline. The press release also stated "Following the Congresswoman’s month-long campaign to save the tower, which included fact finding, speeches, official requests, and legislation, Congresswoman Wilson was notified, this morning, by FAA officials that the tower had been granted a temporary reprieve from closure...." The press release can leave readers with the misleading impression of cause and effect: Wilson protested for a month, and the FAA caved and postponed this particular airport tower closure. But there was no separate FAA decision for the North Perry tower. In explaining its nationwide decision, the FAA wrote that the delay would buy it time "to attempt to resolve multiple legal challenges to the closure decisions." While congressional pressure nationwide could have played a role in the FAA’s decision, clearly the lawsuits seeking immediate action from the courts was the driving factor. Even if Wilson had ignored the tower battle, the FAA likely would have taken action at North Perry and the other sites. We’re not evaluating Wilson’s claim that an FAA official whose job includes fostering relationships with Congress gave her the impression that she deserved credit -- we are evaluating her claim that her actions led to the FAA’s decision. We rate this claim Mostly False.	None	Frederica Wilson	None	None	None	2013-04-10T11:35:15	2013-04-05	['None']
pomt-03502	"The violent crime rate in America is the same as it was in 1968, yet our prison system has grown by over 500 percent."	half-true	/georgia/statements/2013/jun/07/john-lewis/john-lewis-uses-crime-and-prison-stats-push-justic/	In recent years, elected officials, criminologists and others have examined ways to decrease the number of people sitting in U.S. prisons. For some officials, it’s a matter of money. In the post-Great Recession world, some lawmakers are looking for less costly ways to deal with nonviolent offenders. Other leaders, for different reasons, are concerned about how many people are in prison. U.S. Rep. John Lewis, the civil rights icon and veteran Atlanta congressman, recently co-wrote an op-ed about the "presumption of guilt" he believes the criminal justice system institutionally holds toward African-Americans. The op-ed included some complaints about the prison system. "The violent crime rate in America is the same as it was in 1968, yet our prison system has grown by over 500 percent," wrote Lewis, a Democrat, and Bryan Stevenson, who teaches law at New York University. PolitiFact Georgia wanted to find out whether this claim was accurate. Is the crime rate the same as it was 45 years ago and has the nation’s prison system grown by 500 percent? First, let’s look at the portion of the claim about the growth of the prison system. Lewis and Stevenson were referring to the number of Americans in prison. There were about 188,000 people in state and federal prisons in 1968, according to a report the U.S. Bureau of Justice Statistics sent us. In 2011, the BJS reported 1,598,780 people were locked up in state and federal prisons. A quick comparison of the numbers shows the U.S. prison population is eight times greater than it was in 1968. A BJS official issued a caveat concerning the numbers. "[P]rior to 1977, prisoners in physical custody of a state were counted. Starting in 1977, BJS began counting the number of prisoners under state jurisdiction, or legal authority, since some states began housing prisoners in local jails, private prisons, and paying other states to have physical custody of the inmates," BJS statistician E. Ann Carson said via email. We also checked whether the percentage of people in U.S. prisons had increased by 500 percent since the American population is greater now than it was in 1968. In 1968, 94 out of every 100,000 U.S. residents were in state and federal prisons. In 2011, 492 out of every 100,000 U.S. residents were sentenced to more than one year in prison. The 2011 average is more than five times greater than it was in 1968, so that part of the claim appeared on target. Now, for the crime rate. The FBI does an annual report on crime in the United States that is used by most criminologists. In 1968, the violent crime rate was 298.4 crimes per 100,000 residents. In 2010, the most recent year available, the violent crime rate was 403.6 crimes per 100,000 residents. Obviously, that’s an increase since 1968. If it’s any comfort, the nation’s violent crime has declined steadily since its 1991 zenith of 758.2 crimes per 100,000 Americans. How about in Atlanta? Violent crime data is not available for 1968. The FBI does have information on what are generally considered the most dangerous crimes and puts them in what it calls the Part I category. PolitiFact Georgia had that data from 1969 onward when we fact-checked Mayor Kasim Reed’s claim that felony crimes in Atlanta are as low as they’ve been since that year. In Atlanta, the Part I crime rate was 6,387 per 100,000 residents in 1969. In 2012, the Part I crime rate was 7,997 per 100,000 residents. The 2012 crime rate was indeed the lowest since 1969, so we rated Reed’s claim True. Studies show there’s been an increase in people reporting rape, particularly by individuals they know, in the past three decades. Federal research concluded nearly 70 percent of attempted and completed rapes between 1992 and 2000 were reported. In December 2011, the FBI announced it had changed the definition of rape to penetration, no matter how slight, without the person’s consent. Brenda Jones, a spokeswoman for Lewis, said the claim was based on studies of crime in America’s highest populated state, California, and the nation’s largest municipality, New York City. The studies were done by James Austin, a criminologist who has worked inside prisons and held leadership positions in organizations that study crime and the corrections system for more than four decades. "Many criminologists believe that crime rate data has to be examined within jurisdictions to understand what the impact of current policies have been since we don't have a national crime policy," Jones said. "It's by looking at particular jurisdictions that most data emerges that supports the claim that the violent crime rate today is where it was in the late 1960s in most places." The California study includes a chart that shows the violent crime rate in California in 1968 was the same as 2012. Austin wrote in a November 2012 op-ed that the violent crime rate in California was at its lowest since 1960. The New York City study that they cited went back to 1986. It shows that felony arrests had declined since 1986, but misdemeanor arrests increased. City leaders credit numbers showing a decline in crime to a substantial increase in the size of its police force and computerized mapping techniques to put more officers in high-crime areas. They also cite a "broken windows" approach to policing, which means being more aggressive in combating low-level crime and quality-of-life issues. This was not an easy ruling for us. Lewis and Stevenson wrote that the violent crime rate is the same as it was in 1968, yet the prison system has increased by 500 percent. The claim was part of their argument against the growth of the nation’s prison system. The data we saw show they are correct about the growth of the prison system, but the nation’s violent crime rate has increased nationally. They used California and New York City to make their case about the crime rate, but the national crime rate has increased since 1968 and so has the crime rate in cities like Atlanta. We believe more evidence is necessary for Lewis and Stevenson to prove the first part of the statement. The second part is on target. On balance, we rate this claim as Half True.

pomt-05075	Says "our 12 month job increase was the sixth highest in the nation."	half-true	/new-jersey/statements/2012/jul/04/chris-christie/chris-christie-claims-new-jerseys-job-gains-last-y/	Calling on state legislators Monday to approve a tax cut immediately, Gov. Chris Christie returned to a familiar rallying cry: job growth in New Jersey is among the highest in the nation. "We’ve added nearly 85,000 private-sector jobs since February of 2010, seeing the best year of private-sector job growth in 2011 in over a decade and with 2012 already on pace to be even stronger," Christie said in a speech during the special session of the state Legislature. "Our 12 month job increase was the sixth highest in the nation and we’re seeing housing sales, car sales and personal income increasing at higher rates than the nation." But in claiming "our 12 month job increase was the sixth highest in the nation," the Republican governor also was making a familiar mistake, PolitiFact New Jersey found. As we’ve noted in previous fact-checks, job growth can be measured in two ways -- the net increase in jobs and the percentage increase. Looking at percentage increases accounts for states’ different population sizes. Christie’s claim is right in terms of the net increase, but wrong in regard to the percentage increase, according to seasonally adjusted data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. Between May 2011 and May 2012, New Jersey gained 59,800 total nonfarm jobs -- including private- and public-sector employment -- for an increase of nearly 1.6 percent, according to the bureau. The May 2012 figures are preliminary. That net increase places the Garden State in sixth place among the 50 states, just as Christie said. But the percentage increase leaves the state in 13th place. The governor made the same mistake in February, when he said private-sector job growth in 2011 "places New Jersey in the top third among all of the states." He received a Half True, because his claim was right for the net increase, but wrong for the percentage increase. The governor's office did not respond to requests for comment. Our ruling In a speech Monday during the special session of the state Legislature, Christie claimed "our 12 month job increase was the sixth highest in the nation." That’s a very specific claim, but it’s only true when you look at New Jersey’s net increase of 59,800 total nonfarm jobs between May 2011 and May 2012. The percentage increase of nearly 1.6 percent leaves the state in 13th place. We rate the statement Half True. To comment on this ruling, go to NJ.com.

pomt-14940	Unlike Benghazi, there were no investigations of the 1983 Beirut barracks bombing, none about key aspects of the 9/11 attacks and the Iraq War, and none about embassy attacks under George W. Bush.	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/oct/27/viral-image/internet-graphic-asks-why-focus-benghazi-when-othe/	One of the arguments made by critics of the House Select Committee on Benghazi is that the investigation is being treated differently than previous attacks. The creator of a Web graphic recently sought to draw a sharp contrast, suggesting that there was no investigation of key aspects of other deadly incidents, including the 1983 Beirut barracks bombing, the 9/11 attacks, the Iraq War and embassy attacks under George W. Bush. The post was created by a Facebook community called Point Counter Point and reached a wider audience through a re-posting by Occupy Democrats, a progressive advocacy group with a sizable presence in social media. Here’s part of what the group said in a graphic that circulated on the Internet around the time former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton was testifying before the Benghazi select committee: • "241 Marines die in Beirut. … Zero investigations." • "3,000 Americans died on 9-11. … No investigation why (President George W.) Bush ignored all CIA warnings." • "4,500 American soldiers die in Iraq. … No investigation why the war lasted 10 years at a cost of $6 trillion." • "66 Americans die at U.S. embassies (during the Bush administration). … Zero investigations." A reader suggested we take a closer look, so we did. We found several problems with these claims, along with a nugget or two that checked out. Here's the graphic we're checking: The Beirut bombing On Oct. 23, 1983, a truck filled with explosives breached the perimeter of a Marine barracks compound at Beirut International Airport in Lebanon. An explosion destroyed the building and killed 241 U.S. military personnel. The idea that this was never investigated is wrong. A panel led by Adm. Robert L.J. Long, who had recently finished serving as commander of U.S. military operations in the Pacific, produced a report looking at how the attack happened. The panel’s seven-week probe concluded that the Marines did not have the necessary intelligence to counter the attack, and also found problems with the actions of commanders in Lebanon and senior officers above them in Europe. The 9/11 attacks The graphic doesn’t deny that there were investigations of the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, but it claims that none investigated why Bush "ignored all CIA warnings." However, the highest-profile investigation -- commonly known as the 9/11 commission -- did indeed address the nature of advance intelligence about possible attacks and the response within government. The commission found that as 2001 began, counterterrorism officials received "frequent but fragmentary reports about threats," but "because the amount of reporting (was) so voluminous, only a select fraction (could) be chosen for briefing the president and senior officials." The number of threat reports surged in June and July, the commission found, including a June 30 briefing to top officials headlined "Bin Ladin Planning High-Profile Attacks" and "Bin Ladin Determined To Strike in U.S." on Aug. 6, 2001. Efforts to disrupt various plots were undertaken in some 20 countries. The commission concluded that "no one working on these late leads in the summer of 2001 connected the case in his or her in-box to the threat reports agitating senior officials and being briefed to the president. Thus, these individual cases did not become national priorities." This conclusion may not have squared with that of some critics -- that Bush was given clear and specific warnings yet ignored them while vacationing at his ranch -- but it’s inaccurate to say that this topic wasn’t thoroughly investigated by the bipartisan commission. The Iraq War Several panels have looked at the Iraq War, including one chaired by former judge Laurence Silberman and former Sen. Chuck Robb; another chaired by former Secretary of State James A. Baker and former Rep. Lee Hamilton; and two directed by the Senate Intelligence Committee. In addition, multiple congressional hearings were held on the issue. The Silberman-Robb panel and the Senate panel were both highly critical of pre-war intelligence. Meanwhile, the Baker-Hamilton commission was not designed to be backward-looking; it was asked to analyze the state of post-war Iraq and suggest paths forward. "The situation in Iraq is grave and deteriorating," the Baker-Hamilton commission said in its report. "There is no path that can guarantee success, but the prospects can be improved." Taken narrowly, the graphic has a point that no commission was created specifically to address the question of why "the war lasted 10 years at a cost of $6 trillion." But this glosses over the fact that several major commissions and congressional hearings were undertaken to address the many controversial aspects of the Iraq War, before, during and after the war itself. Embassy deaths under President George W. Bush This is where the graphic makes its most salient point. As PolitiFact has noted, there were at least 20 instances in which terrorists succeeded in killing at least one person in attacks on U.S. embassies, consulates or traveling diplomatic personnel between 2001 and 2009, when Bush was president. (Not all victims were Americans.) But unlike the Beirut bombing, 9/11 and the Iraq War, these attacks did not lead to the creation of a commission, either cumulatively or individually. For the first six years under Bush, the Republicans controlled Congress, while for the final two years, the Democrats did. Ted Bromund, a foreign policy analyst at the Heritage Foundation, drew a contrast with how Congress and the executive branch responded to the 1998 U.S. embassy bombings in Kenya and Tanzania. Even though these occurred under a Democratic president, Bill Clinton, and a Republican Congress -- a lineup equivalent to the one that produced the Benghazi investigations -- the process back then was much less fraught, even though it played out in the middle of the highly polarizing Monica Lewinsky scandal. The bombings "were the subject of a substantial State Department investigation, a massive FBI one, and much congressional action around improving embassy security in the late 1990s and early to mid 2000s," Bromund said. "But they were not the subject of much partisan interest because, first, the American people and the American system had not yet fully put two and two together to see these attacks as part of a rising al-Qaida threat, not merely one-off attacks; second, because the Clinton Administration did not seek to deny the obvious, that the Kenyan and Tanzanian attacks were indeed carried out by an organized terrorist group; and third, Clinton struck Sudan and Afghanistan with cruise missiles in 1998, two weeks after the bombing, in retaliation. While there is significant debate about whether the attack struck a relevant target in Sudan, it did draw widespread GOP support." Michael O’Hanlon, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, also pointed to today’s fractious state of partisan politics as a key source of differences in how investigations were handled then as opposed to now. "The problem with the Benghazi hearings is their blatant partisanship and redundancy," O’Hanlon said. Our ruling The graphic says there were no investigations of the 1983 Beirut barracks bombing, none on key aspects of the 9/11 attacks and the Iraq War, and none about embassy attacks under George W. Bush. The graphic has a point that deadly embassy attacks by terrorists during the Bush presidency did not prompt an investigation like the ones we’ve seen on the Benghazi attack. However, it’s flat wrong about the Beirut attack, and its assertion that key aspects of 9/11 and the Iraq War have not been investigated are largely incorrect. We rate the claim Mostly False.

pomt-02473	"More than 40,000 troops are still stationed in Afghanistan with no clear objective. Even in the best case, by the end of the year at least 10,000 American soldiers will still be on the ground."	half-true	/texas/statements/2014/feb/21/david-alameel/david-alameel-airs-outdated-count-us-troops-afghan/	Calling for an end to the U.S. military presence in Afghanistan, Democratic U.S. Senate aspirant David Alameel cited troop counts that made us wonder. Alameel, a Dallas investor and Army veteran, said in a Feb. 7, 2014, email blast: "It’s long past time to end the war in Afghanistan and bring our troops home. It has been more than 12 years and more than 40,000 troops are still stationed in Afghanistan with no clear objective." "Even in the best case," his email also said, "by the end of the year at least 10,000 American soldiers will still be on the ground." We can’t judge any "clear objective," but current and expected U.S. troop counts are checkable. And to our inquiry, a Pentagon spokeswoman, Elissa Smith, shortly sent a chart by email showing U.S. troop levels in that country from November 2001, after 9/11, to February 2014, when there were 34,000 American troops there, down from 46,000 at the start of December 2013. According to the government, more than 2,100 U.S. troops have died in the conflict. A January 2014 report by the authoritative Congressional Research Service summarized the build-up of American troops in Afghanistan and the build-down. "The number of U.S. forces in Afghanistan, which peaked at about 100,000 in June 2011, was reduced to a ‘pre-surge’ level of about 66,000 by September 2012, and is expected to fall to 34,000 in February 2014," the report said. "The ‘residual force’ that will likely remain in Afghanistan after 2014 is expected to consist of about 6,000-10,000 U.S. trainers and counterterrorism forces, assisted by about 5,000 partner forces performing similar missions." The report continued: "The U.S. troops that remain after 2014 would do so under a U.S.-Afghanistan security agreement that has been negotiated but which President Hamid Karzai, despite significant Afghan public and elite backing for the agreement, refuses to sign until additional conditions he has set down are met." More up-to-date information was available when Alameel spoke. By email, Alameel campaign spokeswoman Suzie Dundas pointed out two news reports on troop levels by CBS News, which attributed figures to the U.S. military. A Jan. 9, 2014, CBS News news story said that roughly 38,000 "American service members remain in Afghanistan." We spotted one higher U.S. troop count, which Dundas ultimately said was the basis of Alameel’s statement. As of the end of 2013, according to a Jan. 10, 2014, report on Afghanistan by the Brookings Institution, roughly 43,000 U.S. troops were in Afghanistan. In contrast, the Pentagon’s chart indicates 38,500 U.S. troops were there at the start of January and about 34,000 U.S. troops there just before Alameel spoke. And what about troops expected to be there at the end of 2014? According to a Jan. 22, 2014, CBS News report noted by Dundas, the Pentagon had just proposed leaving 10,000 troops in Afghanistan after 2014 and drawing down the number of troops to zero by the end of 2016. But other news stories published at the same time said President Barack Obama had been presented with a recommendation including the possibility of having no troops in Afghanistan by year’s end. A Jan. 22, 2014, New York Times news article specified that the Pentagon had proposed that 10,000 troops remain in Afghanistan when the international combat mission ends there later in 2014--or no troops at all. The Times story also said 10,000 troops are "around the minimum number officials say is required to protect the remaining diplomatic, military and intelligence personnel and installations in the country," Caitlin M. Hayden, a spokeswoman for the National Security Council, was quoted as saying that Obama "has not yet made decisions about final troop numbers," which Smith, the Pentagon spokeswoman, reaffirmed to us. Similarly, other news articles--like the Times, quoting unidentified officials--said the recommendation to Obama was to reduce troop levels to 10,000 or to go to zero. Stars and Stripes, a newspaper serving members of the military based in the Department of Defense but operating independently from it, quoted officials as saying the recommendation came from Gen. Joseph Dunford, the top U.S. and NATO coalition commander in Afghanistan, who discussed it during a meeting of the White House National Security Council. The Wall Street Journal said in its story: "Military leaders told Mr. Obama that if he rejects the 10,000-troop option, then it would be best to withdraw nearly all military personnel at the end of this year because a smaller troop presence wouldn't offer adequate protection to U.S. personnel, said officials involved in the discussions." Our ruling Alameel, who advocates ending the U.S. military presence in Afghanistan, said more than 40,000 U.S. troops remain there now and under his "best-case" scenario, at least 10,000 will remain at the end of 2014. This claim may have been close in spirit, but it aired outdated information. There were about 34,000 U.S. troops in Afghanistan just before Alameel piped up though there had been more than 40,000 troops there as of December 2013. Also by the time the candidate spoke, a general had reportedly recommended reducing U.S. troop levels to 10,000--or zero--by the end of this year, though no decision had been announced. We rate this claim, which overstates both the troops there now and the possible number of troops by year’s end, as Half True.

pomt-13994	Says Judge Gonzalo Curiel "is a member of a club or society, very strongly pro-Mexican."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/jun/07/donald-trump/trump-wrongly-casts-california-lawyers-group-stron/	Presumptive Republican nominee Donald Trump says U.S. District Court Judge Gonzalo Curiel is "not treating me fairly." Curiel ruled that the public can see internal papers from the now defunct Trump University. Trump’s critics and reporters have pounced on the documents. They’ve pointed to examples of a calculated effort to target people who could ill-afford expensive training sessions and had little chance of profiting from them. But for Trump, the bad press stems from a bad legal decision that has more to do with his immigration policies than the merits of a lawsuit. He said it is "just common sense" that Curiel’s ties to Mexico explain his ruling. Curiel, born and raised in Indiana, had parents who were naturalized U.S. citizens from Mexico. CBS News host John Dickerson pressed Trump as to what his parents had to do with him not ruling in Trump’s favor. "He is a member of a club or society, very strongly pro-Mexican, which is all fine," Trump said on Face the Nation on June 5. "But I say, he's got bias. I want to build a wall." It’s a serious matter to accuse federal judges of bias solely because of their ethnic background, and top-ranking Republicans have rejected Trump’s line. Our interest though is strictly in this club that Trump referenced. Is it actually "strongly pro-Mexican" as he said? We reached out to the Trump campaign for details and did not hear back. The group in question is the California La Raza Lawyers Association. It dates back to 1977. The group’s immediate past president, Joel Murillo, told us that it was formed in response to stereotyping coming from judges and lawyers. "There were judges on the bench saying people with Spanish surnames were prone to be savages," Murillo said. "When we tried to integrate with the mainstream bar association, we were denied. We were marginalized. The only people who were willing to work with us were us." Murillo says the days of stereotyping are over, and the group now focuses on the professional development of Latino lawyers and encouraging students to pursue a career in law. He called Trump’s description of the association as very strongly pro-Mexican a "misnomer." Murillo said most of the group’s recent work targets improving the quality of education for all students in California. The group has not been involved in the immigration debate. "The closest was when there were beatings by police and others that offended the constitutional rights of people," Murillo said. "We made suggestions of ways to ameliorate attacks on people with Spanish surnames." Our search of the Nexis newspaper database found an episode in 2004 when the association wrote a letter calling for the cancellation of a popular Los Angeles reality television show in which illegal immigrants competed for the free services of an immigration lawyer to apply for a green card. The show "functions as a magnet to encourage people to enter this country without documentation," the letter said. The group’s bylaws state, "The purpose and goal of this association is to promote the interests of the Latino communities throughout the state and the professional interests of the membership." That membership is now about half Latino, Murillo said, and in terms of party affiliation, "the lawyers who belong pretty much reflect the population." California is about 43 percent Democratic, 28 percent Republican and about 24 percent undeclared. Murillo also noted that strictly speaking, the group is focused on the Latino community, a term that is much broader than people with family roots in Mexico. The association’s website, last updated in 2013, describes a judicial committee that "seeks to increase the number of Latinos appointed to judgeships." Kevin Johnson, dean of the University of California Davis School of Law, told us the association is "seen as a pretty moderate group" that’s mainly focused on civil rights. On the legal front, we found the group filed a 2012 friend of the court brief in support of Sergio Garcia, an undocumented immigrant from Mexico seeking admission to the State Bar of California. But the issue was broader than simple Hispanic solidarity. That brief was co-written by the Asian/Pacific Bar Association of Sacramento. In 2002, the San Francisco chapter joined with nine other organizations to support an appeal on the grounds that racism tainted the jury selection process. The defendant, Stanley Williams, did not have a Spanish surname, and the other organizations included the NAACP, the Southern Christian Leadership Conference of Los Angeles, the Asian Law Caucus and the American Civil Liberties Union of Northern California. We asked Johnson if including "La Raza" in the group’s name carried a special meaning. He said the term is "sort of a product of its times" that emerged from the Chicano civil rights movement of the 1960s. "The founders and presidents have not been remarkable, in a political sense," Johnson said. The group is often confused with the National Council of La Raza, an advocacy group often criticized by conservatives. Aside from a similarity in their names, the only tie we found was a link to the National Council of La Raza on the lawyers association website. But that list of links also includes the National Latino Police Officers Association and the Hispanic Chamber of Commerce. The conservative website Redstate posted an op-ed rebuking Trump’s use of the California lawyers group as proof of Judge Curiel’s political motives. The writer, Leon Wolf, called the effort to disparage the association "dishonest." "As far as I can tell, they appear to be a pretty garden variety special interest lawyers association," Wolf wrote. "Every state has these chapters for Hispanic lawyers, black lawyers, women lawyers, Mormon lawyers, Christian lawyers, Jewish lawyers -- you name it, there is a lawyer association for it in every state." Our ruling Trump said Curiel belonged to a group that is very strongly pro-Mexican. The California La Raza Lawyers Association does advance the interests of the Latino legal community and works on issues that matter in Latino communities more broadly. However, it has stayed on the sidelines in the immigration debate. The one exception is one letter from a dozen years ago which objected to a television show on the grounds that the program encouraged people to enter the country without documentation. The group’s rare court filings focus on civil rights in general. Trump’s statement is accurate only in the sense that the association’s mission aims to support Latinos, but even that is flawed because he said the group was pro-Mexican and the Latino designation reaches a wider set of people. The claim ignores critical facts that would give a very different impression.

pomt-00190	With the Republican-backed tax cut, "we’re seeing the result, and to date, federal tax revenues have gone up."	half-true	/texas/statements/2018/oct/19/ted-cruz/ted-cruz-said-gop-tax-cut-led-higher-revenues-did-/	Texas Sen. Ted Cruz touted his support for the Republican-backed tax bill in his second debate against Democratic U.S. Rep. Beto O’Rourke. After saying that previous tax cuts have led to increases in revenue, such as those under Presidents John F. Kennedy and Ronald Reagan, Cruz said, "This time with that tax cut we’re seeing the result, and to date, federal tax revenues have gone up. Federal tax revenues are higher this year than they are last year without the tax cut." (It can be seen here around the 51:00 mark.) Is that correct? Tax collection data If you look at the sheer number of dollars collected, irrespective of inflation and without regard to the size of the overall economy or other factors, taxes went up very slightly. Specifically, new federal data show that tax revenues rose between fiscal year 2017 and fiscal year 2018 by 0.4 percent. (Federal fiscal years run from Oct. 1 to Sept. 30.) The rise is smaller than almost every previous year since World War II, except for a handful of years in which tax revenues declined, largely due to recessions. And the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, a group that favors shrinking the federal deficit, found that the small increase in nominal dollars collected disappears once you add in other factors. If you adjust for inflation, the group found, tax revenues actually fell by 1.6 percent. (This calculation is for the first 11 months of fiscal 2018, compared to the first 11 months of 2017. The group had not calculated the data for the full year by our publication time, but the differences from adding the 12th month should be minor.) You can also look at tax revenues as a percentage of gross domestic product — essentially, factoring in economic growth which should, in turn, generate tax revenues. In this case, GDP growth didn’t boost tax revenues proportionately — this measure fell by 4.1 percent over the first 11 months of the fiscal year. Finally, we can look at actual tax collections relative to the expectations of the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office in June 2017, which was several months before the law passed. CBO’s projection of $3.531 trillion in tax collections was based on population growth, inflation, wage growth, and other factors. By this standard, tax revenue fell short of the projection by 5.7 percent. See Figure 3 on PolitiFact.com Each of these measurements undercut Cruz’s argument that tax revenues increased. "Tax revenues naturally grow with a growing economy," said Donald Marron, a fellow at the Urban Institute-Brookings Institution Tax Policy Center. "The economy has been doing well. Revenues, however, haven’t grown as much. So the tax cuts reduced revenues relative to what they would have been, just as every serious analyst predicted." Is the new tax law the reason for higher nominal revenue? In addition, Cruz portrayed a direct relationship: The tax law was passed, and revenue went up. But that’s questionable. We can probe this question by separating out the months in which the old tax law prevailed and looking only at the months in which the new tax law was the primary factor shaping tax payments. Three months in fiscal 2018 were governed by the old law — October, November and December. Another two months — March and April — were governed by the new law, but were dominated by tax payments for income generated in 2017, and thus was predominantly shaped by the old law. A final month, September, had not produced final data by the time of our article. That leaves six months in which it was the new law that shaped tax payments to the government — January, February, May, June, July and August. And if you compare the cumulative collections for those six months in 2017 and 2018, tax collections actually declined by 3.8 percent between 2017 (when the old law was in force) and 2018 (when the new law was in force). In this chart, the drop from 2017 to 2018 is clearly visible. See Figure 4 on PolitiFact.com Catherine Frazier, a spokesman for Cruz, emphasized that Cruz was correct about the calculation using nominal dollars, "In fact, individual tax revenues this year are $96 billion higher than last year, even after cutting individual taxes," she said. Our ruling Cruz said that with the Republican-backed tax cut, "we’re seeing the result, and to date, federal tax revenues have gone up." They have gone up by less than half of 1 percent in nominal dollars, one of the weakest increases since the end of World War II. They have actually fallen if you factor in inflation, growth in the economy, or prior projections for tax collections. Cruz’s suggestion that the new tax law caused the nominal increase is dubious, since in the months when that new law was the primary mover of tax payments, collections actually fell by 3.8 percent.

pomt-06293	The largest number of gamblers are "from the poorest segments of the population."	mostly false	/florida/statements/2011/nov/18/john-stemberger/largest-numbers-gamblers-come-poor/	In the ongoing war about gambling in Florida, some critics have turned to the Bible to state their case. The Florida Family Policy Council, an Orlando-based conservative Christian organization, has sided with gambling opponents. In a post on its blog, the council poses the question Is Gambling Morally Wrong? The blog post from Oct. 20, 2011, uses partial quotes from Wayne Grudem, a theology professor at Phoenix Seminary in Arizona and author of the book Politics According to the Bible: "My own judgment is that large commercial gambling outlets such as casinos and state-sponsored lotteries bring much more harm to a society than the benefits they generate (such as tax revenue)… First, it is socially harmful (and fiscally regressive) because the largest numbers of gamblers comes from the poorest segments of the population. Second, (it) leads to an addiction to gambling … and this addiction destroys marriages, families … and increases societal breakdown. Third, studies have shown that where gambling businesses are established, crime rates increase." (Here is the page in the book that contains these quotes.) There are a few interesting claims in that statement but for this Truth-O-Meter we will explore whether the largest number of gamblers come from the poorest segments of the population. The council's president, John Stemberger, said the blog was about gambling in general, not just casinos or lotteries in Florida. Gambling is a hot topic in Florida. Two South Florida Republican state legislators -- Sen. Ellyn Bogdanoff and Rep. Erik Fresen -- have proposed opening the door to full-scale gambling by allowing three mega-resort casinos to bid on licenses for Las Vegas-style games. One company, Genting, has proposed a massive casino for downtown Miami. We reviewed six studies that included information about gambling and income as well as several news articles or websites. We also interviewed about a dozen academics who have studied gambling. Some of the sources came from Stemberger and Grudem, while others came from professors, the gambling industry or gambling opponents. The research we examined fell into a few general categories. Research from the casino industry. Not surprisingly, those involved in the casino industry found that the bulk of their visitors are middle or upper-class. American Gaming Association's 2011 State of the States survey of casino entertainment states that compared to the general population, casino visitors are less likely to have a household income of less than $35,000 and more likely to have incomes between $35,000 and $100,000. "The demographic profile of casino visitors is similar to that of the general U.S. population. While men are more likely to have visited a casino than women, and the average casino visitor is slightly older, the breakdown by income and level of education mirrors that of the general population." (For more from the casino industry check out Harrah's 2006 survey.) Lottery studies. There is a lot of evidence -- some focused on particular cities or states -- that lotteries draw in poor people. "A number of studies have investigated the demographic predictors of lottery gambling and have tended to find that, on average, state lottery products are disproportionately consumed by the poor...," states this 2005 Brookings Institution paper. "Average annual lottery spending in dollar amounts is roughly equal across the lowest, middle and highest income groups. This implies that on average, low-income households spend a larger percentage of their wealth on lottery tickets than other households." One of the best examples we found was this 1998 investigation by the Washington Post, which found that the lotteries in Maryland, Virginia and the District of Columbia rely on "a hard core of heavy players, who, on average, have less education and lower incomes than the population as a whole, according to lottery documents and data." For example, among heavy players in Virginia, "one in six had household incomes of less than $15,000, according to the lottery data." In Washington, data showed that "the city's most anemic lottery market lies west of Rock Creek Park in an area with the highest education and income levels and the thinnest concentration of minorities." (To find more articles or studies about gambling in particular cities or states, check out this bibliography at the end of this article or from this anti-casino group.) Researchers at Duke University published a 1999 report, "State Lotteries at the Turn of the Century." It found that lottery participation increased as people made more income but only up to the $100,000-per-year level. Still, among those who do play, "players with incomes less than $50,000 spend more than others, and the lower income categories have the highest per capita spending," it said. One of the report's co-authors, Philip Cook, told PolitiFact in an e-mail that his research shows "poorer households spend a higher percentage of their income on state lotteries (which are the most common form of gambling). The percentage who participate in lottery play is not higher for low income households. But those who do play, play a lot." National gambling research. The most extensive research we reviewed stemmed from The National Gambling Impact Study Commission, a 1999 report done for the federal government. For that study, The National Opinion Research Center at the University of Chicago published a 768-page report compiling surveys of nearly 3,000 gamblers and non-gamblers. The report included detailed statistics on gambling, by income and by type of game. Income Monthly gaming Few times/year gaming One day a year gaming Lifetime Gaming No lifetime gaming Weekly lottery Monthly lottery Yearly lottery Lifetime lottery No lifetime lottery Less than 24k 10.6 11.7 9.8 32.5 35.4 11.4 11.3 19.5 23.8 34.0 24k-49,999 13.0 20.8 9.3 36.9 19.9 14.5 15.6 25.8 18.5 25.5 50k-99,999 11.8 24.3 13.3 33.7 16.8 13.2 15.8 32.1 14.8 24.2 100k or more 16.7 22.0 13.8 33.5 14.0 11.5 14.3 23.6 27.4 23.2 To summarize the report's key findings, we turned to Dean Gerstein, the report's principal investigator who now works as a vice provost and professor at Claremont Graduate University. "If you define gambling fairly broadly — placing a bet on a game of chance at least once in a lifetime, or once in the past year, or even once in the past month — then members of the poorest segment of the population are, in general, less likely to gamble than members of the middle segments. By any reasonable definition, the largest numbers of gamblers are clearly not poor," he wrote in an e-mail to PolitiFact. "The richest Americans, the 10 percent or so with incomes greater than $100,000/year, are actually the most likely to spend money gambling -- as they are to spend money on everything else, since they have far more money to spend. But since this group of well-off people is relatively small, only 10 percent of the population, the number of gamblers from the middle income segments ($25,000 - $100,000) is much larger." But when poor people gamble, a larger proportion have serious problems related to their gambling than wealthier people, Gerstein said. "In general, gambling very heavily doesn’t do nearly as much damage to rich people as it does to poor people — rich people can afford to throw away a lot more money on gambling without getting into hot water." What the experts and Stemberger said Many of our experts said the council's claim was too vague -- research about gambling and income typically specifies the type of gambling, the frequency, and sometimes the location. The regular purchaser of lottery tickets at a store in inner-city Baltimore probably isn't the same as the occasional high roller at the Bellagio in Las Vegas. "In my opinion this is a poorly worded and misleading statement," said David Just, an economics professor at Cornell, who has studied poverty and lotteries. "By no means does this group constitute the majority of those playing the lottery. Those in poverty are just 16 percent of the U.S. population. They do not outspend the other 84 percent of the country. There is some evidence that a larger proportion of them play, but this is weak evidence and heavily disputed. It is widely believed they spend a higher portion of their income than wealthier individuals. While I can sympathize with the motive behind the FFPC (Florida Family Policy Council) statement, it seems they should have been more careful in making their argument. Lottery tickets and casino visitors are really different crowds for the most part." John Welte, a senior research scientist at the Research Institute on Addictions at Buffalo State University of New York who wrote about geographic factors and gambling in this article, told us that the council's claim was wrong. "That statement is not correct," Welte said in an e-mail. "Gamblers are generally not more common in the poorest segments, although poorer gamblers tend to gamble more often. What is true, and perhaps more relevant, is that problem gamblers are more prevalent in the poorest segments of society." But research shows that lotteries can hurt the poor. "The bottom line is a lot of this gambling is directed toward the poorer segments of society who are spending proportionally more," said John Kindt, a business administration professor at the University of Illinois who studies gambling. Kindt said he was speaking primarily about lotteries but that lotteries are like a gateway drug to creating new addictive gamblers. "We are making poor people poorer." We sent our findings to Stemberger, and he asked us to consider two additional reports. One was a 1997 article from the Minneapolis Star Tribune about a study of state treatment programs for problem gamblers that found that poor problem gamblers had debts proportionally higher than more affluent gamblers. But the article stated, "state officials said they couldn't conclude that compulsive gamblers are disproportionately poor. That's because state-funded programs may attract the poor more than affluent people who have insurance or other options for treatment." Stemberger also pointed to studies about gambling in Wisconsin. This 1995 study of Native American casinos found gamers have an average household income of between $20,000 and $30,000 a year. Fewer than 15 percent enjoy household incomes in excess of $60,000, while almost 30 percent have household incomes less than $20,000. But the study didn't state that the gamblers were disproportionately poor compared to the population near the casinos. Our ruling The council's blog stated "the largest numbers of gamblers comes from the poorest segments of the population." The council's president said he was speaking in general about gambling -- not specific to lotteries or casinos or to any specific location. The data about the income demographics of gamblers must be explained in the context of the type, frequency and sometimes location of gambling. There is a lot of data to suggest that lottery sales outlets are concentrated in poor neighborhoods and that poor lottery ticket buyers end up spending a higher portion of their income. But that isn't what the council claimed. And the research about lotteries would not necessarily apply to the Las Vegas-style casinos that the Florida legislature is now considering.

pomt-12649	"Our minority graduation rate went from levels below Milwaukee and Madison, to above 80%" when I was Beloit school superintendent.	mostly true	/wisconsin/statements/2017/mar/24/lowell-holtz/lowell-holtz-says-graduation-rates-soared-minority/	In his bid to unseat Tony Evers as state school superintendent, self-described "kidservative" Lowell Holtz criticizes Wisconsin’s dubious distinction of graduating white high school students at much higher rates than minority students. On his campaign blog, Holtz says his attention to safety and discipline as Beloit school superintendent from 2006 to 2009 improved the completion rate among high school students of color. Specifically, he claimed: "Our minority graduation rate went from levels below Milwaukee and Madison, to above 80%." The statement caught our attention in part because Milwaukee and Madison have well-documented struggles with low graduation rates for black and Hispanic students. To back up his claim, the Holtz campaign pointed to data collected by the state Department of Public Instruction. It’s the best source of data in this case. We confined our review to graduation rates for African-American and Hispanic students because they make up most of the minority students in Beloit. Black students were 26 percent of the total enrollment there in 2006-’07, Holtz’s first year in the district. Hispanics made up 13 percent of the student body. Let’s look at the graduation rates from his time in Beloit, spanning three school years: For African Americans: 2006-’07: 64 percent 2007-’08: 76 percent 2008-09: 85 percent For Hispanics: 2006-’07: 74 percent 2007-’08: 75 percent 2008-’09: 84 percent The figures back up the part of Holtz’s claim about rates climbing over 80 percent on his watch. What about the contention that Beloit’s graduation rates started out below those of minority students in Milwaukee and Madison? At that time, 2006-’07, Beloit’s rate for black students was slightly lower than in Milwaukee, but slightly above Madison’s rate. So that’s a mixed bag. As for Hispanic students, the graduation rate in Beloit was higher than in either of those two districts in Holtz’s first year. But if you look back to the year before he arrived, Beloit’s graduation rate for Hispanic students was significantly lower than the rates in Milwaukee or Madison. Again, some support. For context, the graduation rate for white students in Beloit was considerably higher than for black students, but the gap between the groups narrowed dramatically by Holtz’s third year. That’s because while the rate for whites improved (topping Milwaukee and Madison), the rate for black students rose more. There is another aspect to Holtz’s claim -- to what degree did his policies influence the rate? Specific policy changes he helped enact fueled the progress, Holtz claims, pointing to improvements in safety and discipline. But experts, and Holtz, acknowledge that students, teachers, parents, elected officials and community members all have to play a role. That muddies the water on claiming credit. Our rating: Holtz says that when he ran the Beloit school district, "Our minority graduation rate went from levels below Milwaukee and Madison, to above 80%." Rates rose significantly and topped 80 percent both for black students and Hispanic students. But the picture upon his arrival was not quite as bleak as Holtz claimed. We rate his claim Mostly True.

pomt-02117	Says Rep. Justin Amash "votes more with the Democrats than with the Republicans."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2014/may/13/mike-rogers/does-justin-amash-vote-more-often-democrats-or-rep/	Establishment Republicans who have for years operated under the threat of "getting primaried" by conservative challengers are hoping to turn the tables in Michigan, where there’s an all-out brawl to oust tea party favorite Rep. Justin Amash. Amash has become a polarizing figure within the Republican caucus, according to Politico, and some of his colleagues aren’t pulling punches in taking on the Michigander and his hardline anti-tax, anti-spending, anti-federal government stances. Rep. Devin Nunes, R-Calif., called Amash, "al-Qaida’s best friend in the Congress." Harsh. A fellow Michigan Republican, Rep. Mike Rogers, said Amash is "completely out of line with" voters in his district. "He votes more with the Democrats than with the Republicans, and that’s not out of principle, that’s out of him branding himself as something different," said Rogers, who has contributed $5,000 to Amash’s primary opponent, Brian Ellis. Amash’s countered: "I vote less often with (House Minority Leader) Nancy Pelosi, the real San Francisco Democrat, than any member of Congress." How can you vote with Democrats more than Republicans and rarely vote on the same side as Pelosi, the House’s top Democrat? Something isn’t adding up here, so we decided to take a look. How Amash has voted A spokesman for Amash linked us to OpenCongress.org, a website from the nonpartisan Sunshine Foundation that aggregates voting records. The site also studies which colleague on each side of the aisle votes with members of Congress most and least since January 2013. Pelosi’s profile page says the Republican she least often votes with is, indeed, Amash. The two have been on the same side of just 22 percent of votes. That’s partly achieved by Amash staking out positions that put him against most of Congress on widely bipartisan measures. For example, Amash was one of only two House members to vote against a bill to reauthorize spending for the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children to assist local law enforcement agencies in training for and coordinating efforts to rescue missing children. On Facebook, Amash said the bill created federal bureaucracy and the tax dollars would be better spent locally. (Republicans can criticize Amash’s record, but he’s unique in his diligence about explaining nearly all of his votes on Facebook.) So if Amash seldom votes with Pelosi, is it possible he still votes with Democrats more, as Rogers said? In a word, no. As a whole, Amash has more often sided with the GOP caucus. Amash’s profile on OpenCongress.org says he has voted with his party 82 percent of the time since January 2013. There are certainly many Republicans who toe the party line more closely. Rogers, for example, was with the majority of his GOP colleagues for 96 percent of roll calls since 2013. But there are Republicans who vote with the GOP less often than Amash this Congress, too, though none in Michigan. On some issues, though, Amash has joined forces with Democrats. His high-profile fight to curb NSA funding for metadata collection — which put Amash on the map with civil libertarians — enlisted a coalition of Republicans and Democrats weary of the military-industrial complex. The vote on his measure narrowly failed, with 111 Democrats supporting it — despite strong objections from President Barack Obama — alongside 94 Republicans. So where does Rogers’ claim come from? Rogers spokeswoman had no response but forwarded our request to Amash’s challenger Ellis. They noted that in 2012, a Congressional Quarterly analysis found Amash’s votes put him on the same side of President Barack Obama 51 percent of the time. It’s an interesting tidbit, but it won’t help Rogers on the Truth-O-Meter. The analysis only looked at 61 votes that year where Obama had a stated position. It includes many consequential bills, but it’s just a fraction of the total votes taken in 2012. Further, in 2011 and 2013, Amash was opposite Obama 75 percent of the time. But it did help us find a few interesting examples of Amash voting with Obama’s favored positions. For example, Amash voted "no" on a GOP bill in 2012 that would have extended lower rates for student loans and pay for it with cuts to Obamacare. It passed the House despite a veto threat from Obama. On his Facebook page, Amash said he sided against it because he didn’t believe the cuts covered the cost of lowering student loan rates. Also in 2012, he voted against Republicans on a bill to replace across-the-board spending cuts (the so-called "sequester") with other more targeted cuts, while lifting spending caps on the military. Obama, instead, wanted to replace the sequester with tax increases and cut in other ways; Amash said he opposed the Republican proposal because it increased spending. More recently, Amash was one of just three Republicans (and 20 lawmakers in total) not to vote for more sanctions against Iran last July. At the time, the Obama administration was asking for some leeway from Congress to approach the newly elected Iranian regime with alternatives. Amash later said of his vote: "If our goal is peaceful reform within Iran, it would be wise to give the new president an opportunity to talk before turning to new threats." But again, these are a relatively small number of high-profile votes. Congressional Quarterly found Amash never voted with his party less than 85 percent of the time in a given year. Our ruling Rogers said Amash "votes more with the Democrats than with the Republicans." Rogers didn’t back up his claim, but we found two sources that showed that Amash has sided with Republicans upward of 80 percent of the time. That may be lower than many of his colleagues, and we found found a few high-profile examples of his voting against his own party. But by the numbers, he votes far more often with Republicans than Democrats. We rate Rogers’ statement False.

pomt-12171	Says Dallas Cowboys owner Jerry Jones told players: "Stand for the Anthem or you’re off team."	false	/texas/statements/2017/aug/02/greg-abbott/greg-abbott-celebrates-false-claim-jerry-jones-tol/	Texas Gov. Greg Abbott just celebrated what he described as an ultimatum from Dallas Cowboys owner Jerry Jones to the team’s players: If you don’t stand for the national anthem, you're gone. Abbott said in a tweet posted toward midnight Aug. 1, 2017: "Thank you Jerry Jones: Cowboys Jerry Jones to Players: Stand for the Anthem or you're off team." Abbott's tweet further pointed to a Uconservative.net web post from that day headlined: "Cowboys Jerry Jones to Players: ‘Stand For the Anthem or You’re Off the Team.’" Yet the site’s story, we noticed, doesn’t quote Jones making that statement to players other than to fold in a person’s unsourced July 27, 2017, tweet quoting Jones saying so. So, did Jones tell players to stand up or pack up? According to a September 2016 news blog post by the Dallas Morning News, Jones at the times expressed displeasure about Colin Kaepernick, a San Francisco 49ers quarterback, not standing for the playing of the anthem. Kaepernick said he wasn't standing to protest social inequality; he ultimately kneeled for the anthem through the team’s 16 regular-season games after sitting through the anthem during some pre-season games. ESPN reported in March 2017 that Kaepernick, no longer a 49er, intended to stand for the anthem in the 2017 season. The 2016 Morning News story noted that every Cowboys player had stood for the anthem at the team’s season opener that week. It didn't quote Jones telling players anything. From the story: "I got to give a big pat on the back to our entire team, our coaching staff, our entire organization," Jones said Tuesday morning on 105.3 The Fan's Shan and RJ show [KRLD-FM]. "We strongly, strongly support the flag. In every way, we support -- it's almost ridiculous to be saying it -- the people that for generations and generations have given it all up so we can get out here and show off in front of millions of people on television. We respect that so much. That's the real business. "The forum of the NFL and the forum on television is a very significant thing. I'm for it being used in every way we can to support the great, great contributors in our society and that's people that have supported America, the flag, and there's no reason not to go all out right there. For anybody to use parts of that visibility to do otherwise is really disappointing." After Abbott posted his August 2017 tweet, the Dallas newspaper both took note of the Uconservative web post and pointed out that its reporters previously found no basis to reports of Jones saying he’d fire any player who didn’t stand for the anthem. On Oct. 7, 2016, the paper reported that Jones "never made those or other alleged comments and the episode as described never happened." That post followed on Snopes.com, a venerable fact-checking website, debunking a Facebook post suggesting Jones had addressed players about standing for the anthem. Seeking factual elaboration, we made an inquiry to Abbott’s press office and also emailed a spokesman for the Dallas Cowboys. We’ll update this fact-check if we field replies. Our ruling Abbott said that Jones told Cowboys players: "Stand for the Anthem or you’re off team." In a 2016 radio interview, Jones aired disappointment in Kaepernick not standing for the anthem. We spotted no confirmation of Jones telling Cowboys players to stand or be gone. We rate this claim False. FALSE – The statement is not accurate.

pomt-05322	"New Jersey has the largest transit system in the entire country."	mostly true	/new-jersey/statements/2012/may/17/bill-pascrell/rep-bill-pascrell-says-new-jerseys-transit-system-/	New Jersey’s transit system could begin seeing more customers if Port Authority toll hikes slated for December take effect. That might be good for revenue, but the system is already overburdened, according to U.S. Rep. Bill Pascrell (D-8th Dist.), who spoke about the issue during a May 3 interview on WOR-AM’s "The John Gambling Show." "New Jersey has the largest transit system in the entire country," said Pascrell, who will face Rep. Steve Rothman in the June 5 Democratic primary for a newly redrawn congressional district. "One third of the budget of the transit system comes from the federal government, so what you’re doing is pushing ... folks that continue to drive our bridges and tunnels, (you) are not giving them relief to have an option to use mass transit, which is overburdened as it is right now." New Jersey has a major transit system but is it really the largest in the U.S.? Not quite, PolitiFact New Jersey found. "It depends on how you measure it," said Martin Robins, director emeritus of the Alan M. Voorhees Transportation Center at Rutgers University. Let’s start by noting that not all transit systems are the same. New Jersey has a statewide transit system, meaning its fleet of trains and buses, for example, cover much of the state. Most other transit systems in the country are regional, meaning coverage in part of a state or a portion of two states. "Congressman Pascrell was referring to NJ Transit, the largest statewide transit system in the country," Pascrell spokesman Paul Brubaker told us in an e-mail. So what’s the difference between the transit systems? Politics, Robins said. New York’s Metropolitan Transportation Authority, for example, is funded by fare-payers and the state, but few political jurisdictions in New York state benefit from the MTA. NJ Transit has a built-in constituency in the Legislature because it serves much of New Jersey, he said. Now, let’s check how New Jersey ranks. "(If you’re looking at) which system carries the most people, has the most equipment operating every day, New Jersey clearly does not have the largest transit system in the country. The Metropolitan Transportation Authority in New York is the largest," Robins said. But in terms of statewide systems, New Jersey’s is the largest, Robins said. The American Public Transportation System agreed. "They’re not the largest transit system," said Virginia Miller, a spokesman for the advocacy group, which seeks to improve public transportation by making it available and accessible across the country. "No one’s bigger in North America than (the MTA). They’re one of the biggest in the world. New Jersey is the highest statewide system." Based on 2010 figures in the APTA’s 2012 Public Transportation Fact Book, NJ Transit ranks second in the nation in terms of passenger miles, and seventh for unlinked passenger trips. The Federal Transit Administration does not rank transit systems, but collects certain data from those systems that receive federal funding. Based on that, the FTA confirmed the MTA tops NJ Transit in terms of ridership, size of bus fleet, size of budget and miles of commuter rail. Our ruling Pascrell claimed during an interview on "The John Gambling Show" that New Jersey’s transit system is the largest in the nation, but didn’t distinguish that there are statewide systems and regional systems. Still, transportation experts and agencies we spoke with don’t discount the congressman’s statement. New York’s MTA is the biggest overall and New Jersey is within the top 10. In terms of statewide systems, New Jersey’s is, indeed, the largest. We rate the statement Mostly True. To comment on this story, go to NJ.com.

pomt-04367	Virginia’s educational level among whites is higher than Georgia’s.	true	/georgia/statements/2012/oct/22/larry-sabato/georgia-virginias-education-levels-under-microscop/	With less than three weeks to go before the presidential election, the voting trends of Georgia’s residents took center stage last week in a story by The Atlanta Journal-Constitution. The article explored why Georgia’s white voters cast ballots for GOP candidates. The story is similar to a fact check completed earlier this election season by PolitiFact Georgia on which party has more supporters. Election results and the recent makeup of the state Legislature suggested that more Georgians consider themselves Republican. But why is that? Political analysts in the story cited several factors, including culture, organization and demographics, specifically educational achievement. In other states such as Virginia and North Carolina -- both of which went for President Barack Obama in the 2008 election -- large groups of highly educated non-Hispanic white voters tend to be more liberal and vote Democratic. But in Georgia the educational achievement level and voting persuasion of white voters is different. "I’m pretty sure, despite Atlanta, that Virginia’s educational level among whites is higher than Georgia," Larry Sabato, a national political expert at the University of Virginia, said in the AJC story. From a previous fact check, we knew that more voters in the state identified as Republicans. And an AJC poll released last week showed that Obama had the support of just 22 percent of Georgia’s likely white voters. But is Sabato correct? Does Virginia have a more highly educated white voting population than Georgia? Georgia’s secretary of state does not keep statistics on voters’ education or income levels. Through his political analyst and media relations coordinator, Sabato told us his statement was based on 2008 exit polls conducted by CNN. Reviewing the exit poll of 1,973 Georgia respondents, 31 percent of those polled were white college graduates, compared with the 40 percent of white college graduates among Virginia’s 2,466 respondents. Drilling down further into the numbers, of Georgia’s white college graduate respondents, 73 percent voted for then-Republican presidential nominee John McCain, compared with 25 percent for Obama. Among the same demographic in Virginia, the gap between those voting for McCain and Obama was much smaller than in Georgia. Fifty-five percent of Virginia’s white college graduates voted for McCain and 44 percent voted for Obama. At the postgraduate level, the numbers are even closer. Eleven percent of Georgia’s exit poll respondents identified as postgraduate. Half of those postgraduate voters cast ballots for McCain; 49 percent voted for Obama. Virginia had more postgraduate respondents: 23 percent. Of those, 52 percent voted for Obama, 47 percent for McCain. (That poll did not break down those statistics by race.) This pattern of voters in Georgia and the Deep South of voting for Republicans has been steady despite the education level, said Merle Black, a political science professor at Emory University. "In a state like Virginia where you have a lot of Northern migrants and people coming in from outside the state, things may be different," he said. Looking at the 2008 exit polls, the highest number of McCain votes came from voters with lower education levels, but the main point is that McCain won at every education level, Black said. Using just the exit poll data, Sabato’s statement has merit, but exit polls are one source. Voter data from the secretary of state and census data are probably more reliable, said Kerwin Swint, a political science professor at Kennesaw State University. And as far as education and voting, "the traditional finding from the research is that college graduates are more likely to vote Republican, possibly due to higher incomes, but those with advanced degrees (master’s level and higher) tend to go in the other direction and vote Democrat." Three-year estimates of census data from 2008 through 2010 published in April by the Southern Regional Education Board showed that Virginia (36.5 percent) had a higher percentage of whites over age 25 with bachelor’s degrees than Georgia (30.3 percent). Three-year averages of census data from 2007 through 2009, reported by the National Center for Education Statistics, of whites over age 25 with high school completion and a bachelor’s or higher degree also showed a larger percentage of Virginia residents in that category (37.1 percent) than Georgia residents (31.3 percent). In a news story about Georgia’s white voters and the tendency to cast ballots for GOP candidates, Sabato described the differences in Virginia and Georgia. "Despite Atlanta, Virginia’s educational level among whites is higher than Georgia," he said. Based on exit polls and census data, Sabato’s statement is correct. Examining the data further shows that Georgia’s white voters at any education level are more likely to vote Republican. We rate Sabato’s statement True.

Bob Gibbs wants to make sure you know coal is important in Ohio’s 18th Congressional District and that he doesn’t like efforts to shrink the district’s carbon footprint. Gibbs is the Republican candidate in the 18th, which includes all or parts of 15 counties in Ohio’s Appalachian region. On his campaign website he argues that efforts to restrict carbon emissions, commonly known as Cap and Trade, would increase energy costs and be bad for the district. "In the 18th Congressional District, 100% of electric generation comes from coal. That means that every single household in this district will see a huge increase in their energy bills if Cap-and-Trade would become law." It’s true that all electricity generated in the 18th is produced at coal-fired power plants, but that doesn’t mean when residents flick on their lights they are not also using electricity from other sources. Much of the district gets power from rural electric cooperatives. Other areas, though, are serviced by FirstEnergy Corp.’s Ohio Edison and AEP Ohio’s Columbus Southern Power Co. and Ohio Power Co. First Energy has ownership stakes in two nuclear power plants in Ohio and a third in Pennsylvania. AEP Ohio has two plants in Ohio that burn natural gas to generate power and a hydro-electric plant on the Ohio River. Still, all power generating plants actually located within the district are coal-fired. So while the statement is not completely illuminating, we rate it as True. Comment on this item.

pomt-15080	"The top 1/10th of 1 percent today in America owns almost as much wealth as the bottom 90 percent."	mostly true	/virginia/statements/2015/sep/21/bernie-sanders/bernie-sanders-says-top-01-us-have-almost-much-wea/	Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders told Liberty University students on Sept. 14 that he didn’t expect them to agree with his liberal views on abortion and gay marriage. But Sanders, a U.S. senator from Vermont, sought common ground with students at the conservative Christian university in Lynchburg by casting wealth inequality as a moral issue. "There is no justice, and I want you to hear this clearly, when the top 1/10th of 1 percent -- not 1 percent -- the top 1/10th of 1 percent today in America owns almost as much wealth as the bottom 90 percent," Sanders told the crowd, packed into the Vines Center arena for weekly convocation. "And in your hearts, you will have to determine the morality of that, and the justice of that." We decided to examine Sanders’ statement that the richest 0.1 percent has nearly as much as the bottom 90 percent. It’s a standard line in Sanders’ speeches. Warren Gunnels, policy director of Sanders’ presidential campaign, said the senator’s source for the statistic is a Nov. 13, 2014, article in The Guardian, a British newspaper. As our colleagues at PolitiFact Wisconsin have written, the article reported on the findings of a research paper, about wealth inequality during the past 100 years. The study was commissioned by the National Bureau of Economic Research, a nonpartisan organization in Cambridge, Mass., which is best known as the arbiter for determining when the U.S. economy falls into recession. The authors of the study were economists Emmanuel Saez of the University of California, Berkeley, and Gabriel Zucman of the London School of Economics. Using tax records, they made estimates for 2012 on wealth -- that is, the value of all assets, such as a home, and savings and retirement accounts, minus all debts, such as mortgages and credit card balances. The top 0.1 percent included 160,000 families with net assets of at least $20 million. Meanwhile, the bottom 90 percent encompassed 144 million families with average wealth of $84,000. That report says wealth concentration among the richest Americans followed a U-shaped pattern during the past century. It was high in the beginning of the 20th century and then fell from 1929 to 1978. But the study found that wealth concentration among the richest has been rising since, fueled in particular by gains held by the wealthiest 0.1 percent families. The families in that echelon saw their share rise from 7 percent of total household wealth in the late 1970s to 22 percent in 2012. The bottom 90 percent’s share of the nation’s wealth fell from 35 percent in the mid-1980s to 23 percent in 2012. Two other prominent economists -- Thomas Piketty of the Paris School of Economics and Edward Wolff of New York University -- have said the study makes solid estimates about wealth inequality. Wolff said he was not aware of another study that examined the wealth of the top 0.1 percent. But not all economists think the NBER study is the best way to measure wealth. Richard Burkhauser, a professor of policy analysis at Cornell University, told PolitiFact Wisconsin that while Saez and Zucman are "very well respected economists," he faults their study for excluding Social Security income. "To ignore it as they do grossly understates the wealth held by Americans in the bottom 99 percent of the population," Burkhauser said. Almost 60 million Americans - mostly retired and disabled workers - receive Social Security benefits averaging $1,223 a month, according to the Social Security Administration. Another criticism of the NBER study is that it doesn't take into account changes in tax laws, according to Alan Reynolds, a senior fellow with the libertarian Cato Institute. In a July 9, 2014, op-ed for The Wall Street Journal, Reynolds wrote that new tax laws in the 1980s and ’90s skew the increase in wealth inequality. Those laws, he said, required that more capital income of high-earning taxpayers be reported on individual returns, while excluding most capital income of middle-income savers and homeowners. The Tax Policy Center in Washington estimates that 42 percent of all capital gains and dividends reported to the IRS for 2014 came from the top 0.1 percent. Put another way: Of roughly $722 billion in total capital gains and dividends reported, about $305 billion were filed by the top echelon of earners. The center also estimates that the top 0.1 percent paid slightly more than half of all capital gains and dividend taxes collected for 2014. They paid about $70 billion of the $138 billion generated through the levies. Our ruling Sanders said the top 0.1 percent of Americans have nearly as much wealth as the bottom 90 percent. His claim accurately echoes findings in a study by two internationally known economists, and their work has been widely cited as authoritative. But it needs a clarification: Some economists say the study underestimates middle-class wealth by excluding Social Security benefits and not fully considering certain tax laws. With that qualification in mind, we rate Sanders’ statement Mostly True.	None	Bernie Sanders	None	None	None	2015-09-21T00:00:00	2015-09-14	['United_States']

Cruz, who since has dropped out of the race for the Republican nomination for president, defended his plan to monitor Muslim neighborhoods by citing the Brussels neighborhood of Molenbeek, which has been connected to the architects of the Brussels attack. Then, he turned to President Barack Obama’s approach to terrorism and the differences between their two philosophies: fighting "radical Islamic terrorism" as Cruz and other Republicans call it, or fighting extremist groups, as Obama has clarified. "In the wake of 9/11, there was a broad consensus in favor of a common-sense domestic counterterrorism strategy," Cruz wrote. "But over the last seven years, the focus on protecting the homeland has been lost. The Obama administration has even joined Islamist governments in sponsoring a U.N. resolution that would shred our First Amendment by threatening to make discussion of radical Islamism potentially illegal." It’s no secret Cruz and Obama disagree on what to call terrorists. But is it true the Obama administration "joined Islamist governments" to sponsor a United Nations resolution to "make discussion of radical Islamism" illegal in contravention of the First Amendment? U.N. resolution The Cruz campaign did not answer our queries about the basis of his U.N. claim, but Josh Greenman, opinion editor for the Daily News, replied by email that Cruz’s statement reflected the senator’s "interpretation of United Nations Human Rights Council Resolution 16/18." The U.N. Human Rights Council adopted that resolution in March 2011 with the purpose of "combating intolerance, negative stereotyping and stigmatization of, and discrimination, incitement to violence, and violence against persons based on religion or belief." The resolution promotes religious tolerance and calls on member states to ensure proper representation of religious minorities. The resolution was a compromise, reached in 2011 after more than a decade of negotiations. In 1999, Muslim states, through the Organization of Islamic Cooperation, began introducing resolutions intended to combat what they saw as the defamation of religion, often through the criminalization of blasphemy. Western states opposed the proposals, arguing they interfered with free speech. By 2011, the different parties agreed to modify the resolution to drop any references to blasphemy or defamation. The resolution passed unanimously after that compromise. Then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton called it a "landmark achievement." PunditFact checked a statement related to Resolution 16/18 on Jan. 14, 2015. PunditFact found Mostly False a claim that the Obama administration, through the resolution, supported Muslim allies trying to establish an international blasphemy standard. One clause in the resolution supported that claim: In a list of "actions to foster a domestic environment of religious tolerance, peace and respect," the resolution calls on states to adopt "measures to criminalize incitement to imminent violence based on religion or belief." To defend the United States’ ability to support a resolution with that language without violating its Constitution, PunditFact reported, State Department officials Michael Posner and Suzan Johnson Cook cited a 1969 U.S. Supreme Court decision, Brandenburg v. Ohio. In its ruling, the high court held that all speech is protected "except where such advocacy is directed to inciting or producing imminent lawless action and is likely to incite or produce such action." Therefore, the State Department officials said, the resolution language was in line with U.S. law. PunditFact determined that negotiating with Muslim allies to tone down language on blasphemy and defamation laws did not equate to supporting their cause. However, the resolution language that leaves a door open to criminalization -- an interpretation some Muslim countries have insisted is the correct reading of the agreement -- bumped the rating to Mostly False, rather than False. Cruz goes further Cruz’s claim is more extreme than the one PunditFact checked in 2015. Cruz says that the same resolution could "shred our First Amendment" and threaten to make discussion of radical Islamic terrorism illegal. A web search for experts on Muslim states and the U.N. led us to Turan Kayaoglu, an associate professor at the University of Washington Tacoma who studies the intersection of religion, human rights and international relations. Kayaoglu stressed that no U.N. resolution could in any way threaten the United States’ First Amendment. Whenever the United States signs an international document, Kayaoglu said by telephone, it insists on restrictions to exclude anything that would infringe on First Amendment rights. Kayaoglu said this insistence goes back to 1966’s International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, a landmark agreement on international human rights that the United States also worked to ensure would not supercede its Constitution. As for the other portion of Cruz’s claim, Kayaoglu emphasized that Islamic countries attempted to criminalize blasphemy, or hate speech, through Resolution 16/18, which the U.S., European Union and other actors rejected, as explored by PunditFact. By claiming that the resolution would "make discussion of radical Islamic terrorism illegal," Kayaoglu said, Cruz is interpreting the resolution in the same way as Islamic states, rather than through the understanding emphasized by the U.S. and E.U. When member states of the Organization of Islamic Cooperation attempt to criminalize blasphemy, they usually are focused on "things like defaming Muhammad," Kayaoglu said. Blasphemy laws could extend to discussion of the Islamic State, Al Qaeda, Boko Haram and other terrorist groups. Or, as Cruz calls it, "radical Islamism." "In an interesting way, what Sen. Cruz is believing, is he’s following the interpretation of Islamist governments that’s been rejected repeatedly by the Obama administration and other European governments," Kayaoglu said. When the resolution passed in 2011, Clinton, then secretary of state, offered the United States’ interpretation of the agreement: "The United States strongly supports today’s resolution, which rejects the broad prohibitions on speech called for in the former ‘defamation of religions’ resolution, and supports approaches that do not limit freedom of expression or infringe on the freedom of religion," she said. Our ruling Sen. Ted Cruz said that the Obama administration has "joined Islamist governments in sponsoring a U.N. resolution that would shred our First Amendment by threatening to make discussion of radical Islamism potentially illegal." The United States in 2011 voted in support of United Nations Human Rights Council Resolution 16/18, which promotes religious tolerance. That approval only came after the U.S. and its western allies successfully negotiated to have language criminalizing blasphemy dropped from the resolution to ensure it comports with free speech rights and the First Amendment. Cruz’s interpretation of the resolution’s wording, one expert said, more closely resembles that of Islamist governments than the Obama administration. We rate this claim Pants on Fire.

pomt-13355	The Great Recession emerged "in large part because of tax policies that slashed taxes on the wealthy, failed to invest in the middle class, took their eyes off of Wall Street, and created a perfect storm."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/oct/02/hillary-clinton/hillary-clintons-base-linkage-tax-cuts-and-great-r/	During the first presidential debate, Hillary Clinton tried to fix blame for the Great Recession on a cherished part of conservative economic policy -- tax cuts. "Trickle-down did not work," Clinton said, referring to a derisive name for tax cuts that dates from the presidency of Ronald Reagan. "It got us into the mess we were in, in 2008 and 2009. Slashing taxes on the wealthy hasn’t worked." Later in the debate. Clinton doubled down on that argument, saying, "Well, let’s stop for a second and remember where we were eight years ago. We had the worst financial crisis, the Great Recession, the worst since the 1930s. That was in large part because of tax policies that slashed taxes on the wealthy, failed to invest in the middle class, took their eyes off of Wall Street, and created a perfect storm." We had usually heard from experts that the Great Recession stemmed most directly from the bursting of a housing bubble that led to a financial-sector meltdown. So we wondered whether economists thought Clinton’s argument held water. First, some history: President George W. Bush enacted two rounds of tax cuts, though critics said that richer Americans benefited disproportionately. It is these cuts -- coming on top of previous rounds of tax cuts for wealthier Americans -- that play a prominent role in Clinton’s assertion at the debate. Most, though not all, of the economists we contacted -- liberals, conservatives and in between -- expressed skepticism about the linkage Clinton made. (For their part, our friends at the Washington Post Fact Checker gave the claim Three Pinocchios out of a possible four, in large part based on the analysis of a 663-page report from 2011 by the Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission.) That said, when we contacted the Clinton campaign, they stood by the assertion. Two of the campaign’s arguments stand out as plausible: • Bush administration regulators took their eyes off Wall Street. • Bush’s tax and budget policies fostered income inequality that, in turn, promoted unsustainable investments by the wealthy in homes owned by families with stagnating income and uncertain abilities to pay them back. We found one expert who strongly sided with Clinton’s analysis -- Robert S. McElvaine, a historian at Millsaps College who has written about the Great Depression and the Great Recession. (The Post’s Fact Checker found a couple more that had been put in touch through the campaign.) "It’s not the tax cuts for the rich per se, but their effect of concentrating income at the very top that was the major cause of the Great Depression," and, in turn, the Great Recession, McElvaine said. When income is too concentrated, he said, the rest of the population doesn’t have enough to maintain sufficient demand, and the economy suffers, he said. So there is at least some support for a lack of Wall Street regulation and income inequality for setting the stage for the financial crisis that spawned the recession. However, the economists we checked with expressed skepticism -- some strongly so -- about Clinton’s assertion that the recession emerged "in large part" due to tax policies. On the left, Dean Baker, co-director of the liberal Center for Economic Policy and Research, said he wouldn’t just call tax cuts a minor factor in causing the recession -- he said he "can't think of any way they were a factor at all." If anything, he said, "the conventional wisdom goes the other way -- tax cuts tend to increase the deficit, which pushes up interest rates and in turn drags down house prices." On the right, Dan Mitchell, an economist with the libertarian Cato Institute, agreed. "Hillary is spouting nonsense," he said. "No economic theory links tax cuts -- or, for that matter, tax increases -- to financial market meltdowns." Other economists we contacted echoed these sentiments. "Clinton is on solid ground criticizing Bush’s tax cuts, but blaming them for the recession goes too far," said Bruce Bartlett, a former Ronald Reagan aide who has sometimes broken with some conservative orthodoxies. "One can certainly say that the Bush tax cuts failed to raise economic growth or lower unemployment to any significant degree, and one can argue that the Reagan tax cuts were not especially stimulative as well. But to argue that the Bush tax cuts caused the 2008-09 recession is a stretch." Harvey Rosen, a Princeton University economist who was an official in the administrations of both Bush and his father, said that tax cuts seem like an unlikely culprit, because "historically we’ve had relatively low rates without terrible -- or any -- recessions." He added that low tax rates "would not make my list of the top 10 reasons for the recession." Instead, Rosen pointed to a "housing bubble in the United States and Europe that was fed by excess liquidity and poorly regulated mortgage markets." This became a problem, he said, when large financial institutions that had huge amounts of assets dependent on high housing prices found themselves with too little capital to stave off failure when the market crashed. "After a number of financial firms failed, it caused a panic, and confidence in the financial system collapsed," Rosen said. "With the collapse in confidence came a collapse in credit markets -- no one was able to borrow -- which ultimately caused a contraction of the real economy." Brookings Institution economist Gary Burtless added another factor: the irrational psychologies of the bubble, on the part of both homebuyers and lenders who felt empowered to pursue risky arrangements in the absence of strict regulation. "By the middle of the 2000-2010 decade, a great many loans were made that prudent lenders would not have made in the 1990s or ever the early 2000s," Burtless said. This, in turn, led to the "end of a housing boom, a sharp decline in housing prices, widespread mortgage defaults, widespread mortgage securities defaults, and a lack of assets to cover the losses at nine large financial institutions -- Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, Morgan Stanley, Merrill Lynch, Goldman Sachs, Bear Stearns, Lehman Brothers, the CitiCorp holding company, and the AIG holding company," said Lawrence White, an economist at New York University’s Stern School of Business. Our ruling Clinton said the Great Recession emerged "in large part because of tax policies that slashed taxes on the wealthy, failed to invest in the middle class, took their eyes off of Wall Street, and created a perfect storm." It’s broadly accepted that lack of Wall Street regulation played a role, and it’s arguable that income inequality helped set the conditions. But an ideological cross-section of economists agreed that the recession was primarily caused by a housing bubble that turned into a financial crisis, and that it was caused by many factors more significant than low taxes. So for Clinton to say that tax cuts for the rich "in large part" caused the Great Recession is a significant exaggeration.

pomt-11990	"Since 2010, Republicans have won unaffiliated voters in every general election."	mostly true	/north-carolina/statements/2017/sep/27/dallas-woodhouse/woodhouse-says-gop-winning-unaffiliated-voters-nc/	The number of unaffiliated voters recently surpassed the number of registered Republicans in North Carolina, leaving the GOP as the third largest voting bloc on paper. According to NC GOP’s executive director, Dallas Woodhouse, Republicans should view this as good news. Upon hearing that there are now 2,640,000 registered Democrats, 2,056,000 unaffiliated voters and 2,055,000 Republicans, Woodhouse said unaffiliated voters have helped Republicans more than Democrats in recent elections. "It is important to note that since 2010, Republicans have won unaffiliated voters in every general election," he said. As Woodhouse acknowledged in an email, there’s no way to tell how individual voters cast a ballot – because voting ballots are secret. The N.C. State Board of Elections and Ethics Enforcement cannot compile or release data on how any group of registered voters voted, said Pat Gannon, the board’s spokesman. "Because of the secrecy of the ballot, we wouldn’t be able to determine who unaffiliated voters voted for," Gannon said. So there’s that obstacle. But does that mean Woodhouse is wrong? Election results In fact, election results and exit polls tend to back him up. Basically, Woodhouse argues that Republicans have outperformed Democrats in many recent statewide election results, despite having fewer registered voters. In 2010, Republican Sen. Richard Burr won re-election. In 2012, for the first time in decades, a Republican won the race for governor. After going for President Barack Obama in 2008, the state supported Republican Mitt Romney. In 2014, Republican Thom Tillis unseated incumbent Sen. Kay Hagan, a Democrat. In 2016, NC voters favored Republican Donald Trump for President, Democrat Roy Cooper for Governor and Burr for Senate. Woodhouse mostly focused on the races for president, governor and senator. But Cooper is one of several Democrats who won statewide races over the years, including for state auditor (Beth Wood), secretary of state (Elaine Marshall) and attorney general (Cooper, then Josh Stein). Don’t those victories weigh against Woodhouse’s claim? That brings us to the evidence from exit polls. Exit polls Woodhouse provided links to several exit polls that show self-described independents consistently supporting Republicans and PolitiFact found other polls that show the same pattern. There’s one caveat to this: people don’t always describe themselves accurately in exit polls. A 2017 Elon University poll found a difference between voters who were registered with a party but identified themselves as independents. The Elon poll found that 43 percent of the roughly 500 voters surveyed identified as independent. But only 30 percent were unaffiliated. But here’s what exit polls have found: A CNN exit poll in the 2016 elections for president, governor and Senate, which surveyed about 4,000 people, asked voters to identify themselves as Republican, Democrat or independent as well as liberal, conservative or moderate. The polls found that independents favored Trump, Burr and McCrory. Moderates, however, supported the Democrats in each race. A Quinnipiac poll published a day before the election supports the findings of the CNN exit poll. Quinnipiac gave the edge to Cooper, despite finding that independent voters favored McCrory. It showed independents supporting Burr and Trump at an even higher rate. An Elon University poll from 2016 also showed independents breaking for McCrory. And an exit poll done for a group of media organizations and published by the New York Times showed a similar breakdown: independents and those favoring third parties favored Trump and moderates favored Hillary Clinton. A 2014 CNN exit poll shows self-identified "independents" supported Republican Thom Tillis over Democrat Kay Hagan 49 percent to 42 percent, respectively. Meanwhile, self-identified "moderates" favored Hagan 59 percent to 36 percent. According to another exit poll published by the New York Times, this one in the 2012 presidential election, self-identified independents favored Romney and moderates favored Obama. Participation in primaries Recent primary elections reflect what the exit polls suggest: that unaffiliated voters are more interested in voting for Republicans than Democrats. In North Carolina, unaffiliated voters can participate in the primary elections for any party they choose. Stats provided by the state elections board show that unaffiliated voters have overwhelmingly participated in the Republican primary in each election since 2010. In 2010, 54 percent of unaffiliated voters took Republican ballots while 39 percent took Democratic ballots. In 2012, 44 percent took GOP ballots while 30 percent took Democratic ballots. In 2014, 61 percent took Republican ballots while 33 percent took Democratic ballots. And in 2016, 56 percent took GOP ballots while 41 percent took Democratic ballots. The consistent participation in Republican primaries shows many unaffiliated voters have partisan leanings and puts the idea of unaffiliated voters as "swing voters" into doubt. "In fact, most independents who ‘lean’ to one party over the other vote at levels comparable to partisans, at least nationally," said Michael Bitzer, professor of politics and history at Catawba College in Salisbury. Bitzer’s comments are supported by a 2016 Pew Research study, which notes that most independents express a partisan leaning. What experts think Most experts PolitiFact spoke with suggested Woodhouse’s claim is on track, even though it’s nearly impossible to verify with complete certainty. Jason Husser, director of the Elon University poll, warned against people making assumptions without polling of voters whose partisan affiliations are known. "The only way anyone could make that ‘every general election since 2010,’ claim with confidence is if they have multiple quality surveys using voter registration list samples (not random digital dial samples)," Husser said. "Otherwise they couldn't differentiate registered as unaffiliated voters from self-identified independents (who are often registered with a party)." Still, Tom Jensen, director of Public Policy Polling, a left-leaning polling firm, described the claim as "basically right." "Democrats still having such a large registration advantage over Republicans," Jensen said, "basically means it’s impossible for Republican candidates to win statewide without winning independents." Our ruling Woodhouse stated unequivocally that Republicans have "won" North Carolina’s unaffiliated voters in each general election since 2010. There is no way to prove that claim with complete certainty because ballots are private. And exit polls can be unreliable because voters sometimes misrepresent their political allegiances. However, polls and primary participation stats show a consistent trend of unaffiliated voters voting for Republicans. Furthermore, given the relatively lower number of registered Republicans, experts say the GOP wouldn’t have achieved its recent success without repeatedly winning over unaffiliated voters. PolitiFact rates this claim Mostly True. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com	None	Dallas Woodhouse	None	None	None	2017-09-27T12:48:31	2017-09-13	['Republican_Party_(United_States)']
pomt-11510	Say David Hogg is a crisis actor.	pants on fire!	/florida/statements/2018/feb/21/blog-posting/why-you-shouldnt-believe-claims-stoneman-high-stud/	Multiple internet bloggers are falsely accusing David Hogg, a student survivor of the deadly shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla., of being a paid actor with a past of pushing for additional restrictions on guns. The conspiracy theories spread to the mainstream when Benjamin Kelly, an aide for Florida state Rep. Shawn Harrison, R-Tampa, told a reporter that Hogg and another student were "actors" who "travel to various crisis (sic) when they happen." See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com The aide was fired, and the Broward County School District said Hogg and his classmate are "absolutely students at Stoneman Douglas." Here are the facts. The genesis of the ‘crisis actor’ claims Conspiracy theorists have latched on to a CBS news video of Hogg in Los Angeles from 2017 as evidence that the teen might be a plant. Hogg posted a video that showed an argument between his friend and a lifeguard on Redondo Beach. The argument was unrelated to guns. After Hogg’s friend put a boogie board on a trash can on the beach, a lifeguard asked him to remove it. The friend complied with the lifeguard's request, but the interaction turned sour after the friend made a snide remark. Hogg’s video of the dispute went viral. CBS later interviewed Hogg about the dispute and the video. From there, websites like the conspiracy-minded Infowars reached for straws, including Hogg’s appearance after the shooting on CBS This Morning. "Interestingly, Hogg has reconnected with CBS for an appearance on CBS This Morning as the mainstream media unabashedly features high school students as figureheads for a new anti-gun push," InfoWars wrote in a blog. Folks on the internet took the claim one step further and claimed that the video was proof that Hogg was just pretending to be a high school student in a different state. At one point, the No. 1 trending video on YouTube was a video suggesting that Hogg was an actor, but the video has since been removed. Hogg says he was visiting California, which is corroborated by his personal Twitter account. "I love going to LA for the summer," he tweeted August 5, 2017. See Figure 3 on PolitiFact.com Shortly after, on Aug. 10, 2017, Hogg posted a short vlog (video blog) on YouTube about his experience in California. And finally, The Eagle Eye, Marjory Stoneman Douglas' newsmagazine, published a story about his vacation and viral video. More on the California connection Some social media users took the claim further and said that Hogg actually graduated from Redondo Shores High School in California. But evidence that supported those theories — like a supposed yearbook photo of Hogg in California — was debunked by fellow Stoneman Douglas High students on Twitter. One student, Sarah Chadwick, said that the images of Hogg allegedly pictured in a California yearbook were really from Stoneman High. "She claims it’s not a Douglas yearbook (which I promise it is, I know multiple people in that picture) yet there’s someone in the pic wearing a douglas t-shirt????" Chadwick tweeted. See Figure 2 on PolitiFact.com Another Stoneman Douglas High alumnus tweeted a video, which showed him flipping to Hogg’s photo in a Douglas yearbook. "There’s a photo going around claiming David Hogg did not attend Douglas, but a school in California. Here’s a video to debunk that:" tweeted Joey Wong. See Figure 4 on PolitiFact.com Hogg’s father is a former FBI agent Some, meanwhile, have used Hogg’s criticism about the FBI, combined with the fact that his father is a former FBI agent, to suggest some conspiracy aimed at hurting President Donald Trump. Those theories are unfounded. Our ruling Conspiracy-minded websites are claiming Stoneman Douglas High students are crisis actors hired to stir up controversy. Not only is there no credible evidence to support this claim, plenty of evidence contradicts it entirely. The school district has confirmed that the targeted students are, in fact, students. Broward County Schools Superintendent Robert Runcie and Stoneman High students on Twitter have confirmed that Hogg is a senior at Stoneman Douglas, not a crisis actor.

pomt-03141	In 2012, the state "put together a list of over 100,000 people that they thought were ineligible to vote. Came out there were less than 10."	mostly false	/florida/statements/2013/sep/12/charlie-crist/charlie-crist-says-secretary-state-put-together-li/	Florida’s effort to search for noncitizens on the voter rolls launched a firestorm in the weeks leading up to the 2012 presidential election. Gov. Rick Scott’s initiative was lampooned on The Daily Show; the U.S. Department of Justice cried foul; and two South Florida congressmen held a presser to tout errors on the list, including a Brooklyn-born World War II vet flagged as potentially not being a citizen. But in the end, just how many noncitizen voters did Florida find among almost 12 million voters? Former Gov. Charlie Crist gave his answer in a speech to Louisiana Democrats on Aug. 17, 2013. He started by bashing the state’s recent announcement that it intends to scrutinize the voter rolls for noncitizens yet again. "Our governor just announced last week he is going to start a purge of voters in Florida," Crist said. "They tried it last year. The secretary of state put together a list of over 100,000 people that they thought were ineligible to vote. Came out there were less than 10. I mean, what a joke. It’s unconscionable what they will do to win these elections." Crist, a former Republican turned independent turned Democrat, is considering a bid against Scott. If Crist runs in 2014, one way he will try to boost turnout among Democrats and minorities is by hammering Scott’s record on voting rights. So was he correct to say that the effort to get rid of noncitizen voters only led to "less than 10" being removed? 2012 efforts to purge voter rolls First, we’ll briefly recap the history of the search for noncitizen voters. Shortly after Scott took office in 2011 he asked his top election official at the time to look into removing noncitizens from the voter rolls. By 2012, the Division of Elections put together a list of about 180,000 potential noncitizens based on driver’s license data. The state whittled the list down to about 2,600 names and sent them to county election supervisors in April 2012. Liberal groups criticized the list that they said disproportionately targeted Hispanics and other minorities. Supervisors found all sorts of errors and would later use words such as "sloppy" and "embarrassing" to describe the state initiative. One of the problems was that the driver’s license data doesn’t get updated when a legal resident later becomes a citizen. By September 2012, the Division of Elections said it had confirmed 207 noncitizens on the voter rolls and that the names would be provided to county elections supervisors to contact the voters. Any that matched federal homeland security data would be removed. Later that month the state produced a new list of 198 potentially ineligible voters. But by then, supervisors were fed up with the timing and process, and the effort appeared to fizzle out. A year later, in August 2013, news broke that the state was about to launch another round of searching for noncitizens on the voter rolls. So what was the total removed? PolitiFact Florida asked the division of elections for the total number of noncitizens removed, including a breakdown by county, during 2012. The best figures we could obtain from the state only included those removed as of Aug. 1, 2012. We counted 85 who were listed as being removed because they were "not a U.S. citizen." (A few additional voters on that list were removed for other reasons, such as being dead or moving out of state. One category for removal was "request by voter," though it doesn’t explain why the voters requested it.) As a back-stop, we next checked in directly with some of the county supervisors of elections to see how many noncitizen voters they removed from the rolls. Their answers made it clear it was more than 10. Miami-Dade: 16 voters removed. Collier: 36 removed. Broward: Seven voters removed. Orange: Seven voters removed. Lee: Six voters removed. Hillsborough: Two voters removed. Pasco: Two voters removed. Pinellas: Six voters removed. We asked Crist to explain how he arrived at his figure of "less than 10." "Just from news accounts, may have been around 40 or so actually," he responded in an email. "And somewhat more purged." He sent us a copy of an August 2013 New York Times article about the state’s renewed effort that stated: "Ultimately, the list of possible noncitizen voters shrank to 198. Of those, fewer than 40 had voted illegally." Our ruling Crist said that in 2012, "the secretary of state put together a list of over 100,000 people that they thought were ineligible to vote. Came out there were less than 10." If Crist’s point was that only a tiny fraction of noncitizens were found on the voter rolls, that’s certainly true. But he’s wrong that the number was less than 10.

pomt-13009	"We adopted the modern Social Security system at a time when the average person died before they were old enough to get Social Security."	true	/virginia/statements/2016/dec/12/newt-gingrich/gingrich-correct-life-expectancy-initially-fell-sh/	Social Security today is not the program President Franklin D. Roosevelt had in mind when he signed it into law in 1935, according to former House Speaker Newt Gingrich. "We adopted the modern Social Security system at a time when the average person died before they were old enough to get Social Security," he said during a Dec. 2 interview on "The John Fredericks Show," broadcast in Virginia. "We now have some people who are living 50 years on Social Security," Gingrich said. "Nobody ever tried to design a system like this, and we’re going to have to rethink our whole approach." We wondered if Gingrich was right about life expectancy falling short of Social Security age in 1935. The bill signed by Roosevelt offered benefits to retirees when they turned 65. U.S. life expectancy for a person born in 1935 was just under 62 years, according to records from the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. On average, girls were expected to live to 64 and boys to 60. We were curious whether the retirement age was set purposely at 65 to deprive most people of receiving Social Security. Did Roosevelt make this calculation? "Certainly the Roosevelt administration did not," said Edward Berkowitz, a professor of public policy at George Washington University and author of several books on Social Security. "My understanding, that I received from longtime Social Security actuary Robert Myers, was that the age 65 had no particular significance and was chosen because a choice needed to be made and (it) seemed reasonable." Myers, who died in 2010, helped to write the Social Security law and in a 1992 memoir offered a simple explanation for how the Roosevelt administration chose the qualifying age for benefits. "Age 65 was picked because 60 was too young and 70 was too old," he wrote. "So we split the difference." Berkowitz told us that life expectancy at birth - then and now - "is not a good measure of how many people who are working and paying into Social Security will die before age 65." That’s because the life expectancy average is skewed by infant deaths. After infancy is survived, life expectancy goes up. That said, we’ll give you one final set of numbers. Average U.S. life expectancy from birth in 2015 was 78.8 years, according to figures just released by the National Center for Health Statistics. It declined from 78.9 in 2014 - the first drop since 1993. Average life expectancy for men last year was 76.3 years; for women, 81.2. Our ruling Gingrich said, "We adopted the modern Social Security system at a time when the average person died before they were old enough to get Social Security." We rate his statement True.

pomt-10674	"Iranian mullahs took American hostages and they held the American hostages for 444 days. ...The one hour in which they released them was the one hour in which Ronald Reagan was taking the Oath of Office …"	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2007/dec/18/rudy-giuliani/ad-misleading-about-iran-hostage-crisis/	Rudy Giuliani invokes his tough-on-terrorism image with a television advertisement about the Iran hostage crisis. He gets most of the facts correct but his insinuation that President Reagan deserves all the credit for the hostages' release is wrong. Here is the transcript of his 30-second commercial, spoken as grainy black and white photos of hostages appear on the screen: "I remember back to the 1970s and the early 1980s. Iranian mullahs took American hostages and they held the American hostages for 444 days. And they released the American hostages in one hour, and that should tell us a lot about these Islamic terrorists that we're facing. "The one hour in which they released them was the one hour in which Ronald Reagan was taking the Oath of Office as President of the United States. The best way you deal with dictators, the best way you deal with tyrants and terrorists, you stand up to them. You don't back down. I'm Rudy Giuliani and I approve this message." The script is technically accurate. On Nov. 4, 1979, militant Iranian students — not mullahs, as Giuliani says — took control of the U.S. Embassy in Tehran, taking 66 hostages. Of those, 52 remained in captivity for 444 days. The terms of their release is the Algiers Accord, an agreement negotiated by Jimmy Carter's administration on Jan. 19, 1981, according to State Department documents. The following day at 12:23 p.m. EST, less than one hour after Carter relinquished the presidency to Ronald Reagan, the hostages were let go. But just because it happened on Reagan's watch, doesn't mean he deserves credit, said Warren Christopher, Carter's deputy Secretary of State and lead negotiator for the United States. "It happened that they did not hit Algiers until (Reagan) was in office about a half-hour," Christopher said. "But all the negotiations took place before the inauguration." Temple University professor David Farber and journalist Mark Bowden both wrote books about the Iranian hostage situation and reach similar conclusions. "The whole direction is misleading," Farber said. "Reagan had made no claims he would do something specifically different. There was no cause-and-effect relationship." "(Giuliani) is reporting one of the standard glib historical assessments of the hostage crisis," Bowden said. "The idea that Reagan had any affect on their release is laughable." Bowden said waiting until Carter left office had more to do with the Iranian leaders dislike of Carter "than a fear of Reagan," he added. While Giuliani is technically correct that the hostages were released after 444 days in the first hour Reagan took office, Reagan wasn't responsible. So Giuliani's message doesn't match the facts. We rule this statement Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.

pomt-12235	Russian natural gas company "Gazprom held Europe by the throat -- they were a monopoly, and now the U.S. is breaking into that monopoly with our exports of (liquefied natural gas)."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2017/jul/17/pat-robertson/us-liquefied-natural-gas-game-changer-russia-europ/	When PolitiFact fact-checks an interview with the president, we usually train our Truth-O-Meter on the president’s answers. But during a recent televised sit-down between President Donald Trump and televangelist Pat Robertson on the Christian Broadcasting Network, a question by Robertson caught our attention. Robertson said Gazprom, a Russian natural-gas giant, "held Europe by the throat -- they were a monopoly, and now the U.S. is breaking into that monopoly with our exports of LNG," or liquefied natural gas. Trump replied, "We are. We have LNG exporting all over." The normal way to transport natural gas is through pipelines, but pipelines aren’t considered economical for transoceanic shipments of natural gas. Liquefied natural gas, or LNG, has been cooled so that it can be shipped more efficiently as a liquid in specially designed cargo ships. Transporting natural gas this way requires specialized facilities at both ends of the voyage. (Here’s a more detailed explanation from the federal government.) See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com Diagram: Government Accountability Office With that in mind, we wondered whether Robertson was accurately describing the current state of trade in natural gas between the United States, Europe, and Russia. We found that Robertson had a point, but one that was oversimplified. (A public-relations firm that represents the Christian Broadcasting Network, which was founded by Robertson, told PolitiFact that they had nothing to add to his comments during the interview.) We’ll break down Robertson’s claim into two pieces. Did Gazprom hold ‘Europe by the throat’? Is it ‘a monopoly’? Gazprom does indeed have a history of being used by the Russian government as a hardball tool of foreign policy. In 2008, during a dispute with Ukraine, Russia cut off gas supplies to Europe. Natural gas emerged as a possible conflict point again in 2014, after the Russian annexation of the Ukrainian region of Crimea. Threats by Russia are credible because certain European countries are heavily dependent on Russian natural gas. "Russia supplies 100 percent, or close to 100 percent, of natural gas imports in some central eastern and southeastern European countries, including Estonia, Latvia, Bulgaria, Slovakia, Finland and, until recently, Lithuania," said Jason Bordoff, director of Columbia University’s Center on Global Energy Policy. This "gives Russia some leverage," Bordoff said. "Unlike oil, which can more easily and flexibly be moved from place to place, gas typically moves through pipeline, which makes buyer and seller more dependent." That said, Robertson’s phrasing isn’t entirely accurate, experts told PolitiFact. Gazprom is a monopoly from the perspective of Russia, Bordoff said -- that is, it’s the only company allowed to export pipeline gas from Russia. But it is not a monopoly from the perspective of its European buyers, especially in the northwestern and southern portions of the continent, where energy portfolios are more diversified, said Tim Boersma, a senior scholar at Columbia’s Center on Global Energy Policy. "Russia only supplies about one-third of Europe's gas, so Europe has plenty of other sources," Bordoff said. In many cases, he said, European countries buy Russian gas because it is cheaper -- not because it’s the only option. Meanwhile, much of Europe has options beyond natural gas. "Natural gas competes with coal, oil, nuclear and renewables to various degrees across Europe," said Paul Sullivan, an energy-markets specialist affiliated with National Defense University and Georgetown University. "Often, markets for energy sources can overlap, especially in the long run as relative prices change." Is the U.S. now ‘breaking into that monopoly with our exports of LNG’? This is certainly an aspiration of the United States, which in recent years has begun tapping into large reserves of natural gas through hydraulic fracturing, or "fracking." Speaking at a press conference in Warsaw in advance of the recent G-20 summit meeting, Trump said, "Let me be clear about one crucial point. The United States will never use energy to coerce your nations, and we cannot allow others to do so. You don't want to have a monopoly or a monopolistic situation." And the United States’ aspiration is beginning to materialize, at least in a modest way. In June, one LNG shipment traveled from the United States to Poland, and another is expected to arrive in Lithuania later in the summer, Bordoff said. Both shipments were made possible because Poland and Lithuania have built new LNG terminals in recent years. "In these two instances, Bordoff said, "LNG from the United States competes more or less directly with Russian gas." However, the U.S. footprint in European LNG markets is quite small. Currently, shipments to Europe represent a fraction of the United States’ LNG exports -- according to the most recent data, the top 10 buyers of American LNG are dominated by Latin American and Asian nations. In order, they are Mexico, Chile, Japan, China, Argentina, Jordan, India, Kuwait, South Korea, Turkey. In addition, a sizable chunk of the LNG sent by the United States to Europe goes to countries like Spain, Portugal and Italy -- places where American LNG is generally not displacing Russian natural gas. Spain and Portugal do not import Russian gas, and while Italy does, it has a more balanced portfolio, Bordoff said. Limits to future growth Meanwhile, a variety of factors are expected to limit how much of a player United States LNG can eventually become in European markets. Here are some of them: • Infrastructure and price. The cooling and uncooling of LNG adds to the ultimate price of the fuel -- and it requires the construction of LNG-capable terminals. In addition to the LNG terminals in Poland and Lithuania, Croatia is expected to build one, but it probably won’t be operational until 2020, Bordoff said. See Figure 2 on PolitiFact.com A liquefied natural gas carrier docked in France. (Wikimedia commons) Pipelines used by Russia, by contrast, are already built and operating. "American LNG may have some presence in Europe, but Russian gas will be always cheaper and more competitive," said Anna Mikulska, a fellow at Rice University’s Center for Energy Studies. And the United States is not exactly brimming with LNG export facilities, either. The only one located in the lower 48 states is Sabine Pass in Louisiana. Another one, in Alaska, is geared more toward Asian markets. (There are other terminals that take imports only.) "We have a lot of LNG export facilities in the works, but so do the Australians and others," Sullivan said. "Australia is focusing mostly on the Pacific and Asian markets, but it could break into other markets later." • The United States is a latecomer to this market. Even within the universe of LNG exporters to Europe, other countries have a head start on the United States. The top natural gas suppliers to Europe -- via either pipelines or LNG -- are, in order, Russia, Norway, Algeria, Qatar, Nigeria, Azerbaijan, Libya, Trinidad & Tobago, and Peru. Even for Poland and Lithuania, the recipients of American shipments this year, the leading LNG suppliers are currently Qatar and Norway, Bordoff said. "Europe has many actual and potential sources of natural gas and LNG," Sullivan said. "The U.S. is one of them, but this will be small for some time. The U.S. will also be exporting to Asia due to the faster growth of Asian demand compared to Europe." Succeeding in the European LNG market, Sullivan said, "will take a long time and require massive investments." • Russian business practices. "Russia plays hardball with prices," Sullivan said. "As soon as they see possible competition, they drop prices and change other characteristics of gas deals to try to slow the competition." A final note: While neither Robertson nor Trump specifically credited Trump’s actions in office for the progress being made in LNG markets, we should note that these trends were already under way during the tenure of his predecessor, President Barack Obama. "This is not thanks to Trump," Mikulska said. "In fact, the Obama administration's policy to liberalize LNG exports is much more responsible for the growth in LNG trade." Our ruling Robertson said that "Gazprom held Europe by the throat -- they were a monopoly, and now the U.S. is breaking into that monopoly with our exports of LNG." He has a point -- Russia has a history of using natural gas supplies as an instrument of foreign policy, and a number of European countries are heavily reliant on Russian gas, making them susceptible to pressure. However, many European countries have other energy-supply options, and while the United States has made recent gains in the European LNG market, these advances have been limited and face challenges going forward.

pomt-00233	Says Marsha Blackburn "voted against the Reauthorization of the Violence Against Women Act, which attempts to protect women from domestic violence, stalking, and date rape."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2018/oct/09/taylor-swift/taylor-swift-marsha-blackburn-voted-against-reauth/	Pop star Taylor Swift jumped into the rough and tumble of politics with a rebuke of Tennessee Republican Senate candidate Marsha Blackburn and an endorsement of Democrat Phil Bredesen. In a long Instagram post, Swift explained that her concern over matters of gender orientation and racism drove her to speak out. "I cannot vote for someone who will not be willing to fight for dignity for ALL Americans, no matter their skin color, gender or who they love," Swift said. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com Blackburn, Swift said, "terrifies" her. "She voted against equal pay for women," Swift wrote. "She voted against the Reauthorization of the Violence Against Women Act, which attempts to protect women from domestic violence, stalking, and date rape." Here, we look at whether Blackburn in fact voted against reauthorizing the Violence Against Women Act. Blackburn did vote against the bill, but she voted in favor of a Republican alternative. The differences were not great, but they hung on the very issue of gender orientation that Swift wrote about. The 2013 controversy The Violence Against Women Act was two decades old in 2013 when Congress wrestled with renewing the funds to support it. The law paid for programs to prevent domestic violence. It provided money to investigate and prosecute rape and other crimes against women. It supported counseling for victims. The $630 million price tag was less the problem than some specific language on non-discrimination. The Senate approved its bill first on Feb. 12, 2013, by a wide bipartisan margin of 78 to 22. That measure redefined underserved populations to include those who might be discriminated against based on religion, sexual orientation or gender identity. There were also changes in the recognition of the authority of Native American tribes to enforce the law within the tribal justice system. When the bill came over to the House, a key sticking point had to do with orientation and identity. House Republicans crafted a version of the legislation that omitted the sexual orientation and gender protections. The American Bar Association opposed the GOP version, saying "the House substitute eliminates certain critical improvements." Domestic violence shelters in some southern states said they had heard from governors’ offices that they couldn’t use federal funds for LGBTQ victims because the law didn’t explicitly say they were covered. "You show up bleeding at the door and we’re going to address the bleeding, not stop to ask about your sexual orientation or gender identity first," said Ruth Glenn, CEO of the National Coalition Against Domestic Violence. "We didn’t want programs to lose their funding because they didn’t do triage on that basis." The House Republican version failed by a vote of 166 to 257. The nay votes included 60 Republicans. Blackburn voted in favor of the Republican measure. The Senate version, the one that ultimately became law, came up next and passed 286 to 138. The bill had picked up 27 additional Republican votes. Blackburn voted no. We reached out to Blackburn’s office for comment and did not hear back. Our ruling Swift said Blackburn voted against reauthorizing the Violence Against Women Act. Blackburn voted no on the final version that became law. She did vote for a Republican alternative that lacked discrimination protections based on sexual orientation and gender identity. While there were other issues, over two dozen Republicans decided that it was better to fund the act than to continue to oppose the nondiscrimination provisions. Blackburn was not one of them.

pomt-06091	"We are now eighth in the nation in job creation . . . we are No. 1 in the Midwest."	mostly true	/ohio/statements/2012/jan/06/john-kasich/john-kasich-says-ohio-no-8-job-creation-no-1-midwe/	When John Kasich narrowly upset incumbent Democrat Ted Strickland to become Ohio's 69th governor, an issue the Republican pounded on was job creation. Ohio had lost nearly 400,000 jobs during Strickland's tenure, and Kasich played that song again and again as he pinned the losses on Strickland. With Ohio's economy on a modest rebound, the Kasich administration is keeping a close eye on the key economic numbers during his first year in office knowing that how voters perceive Kasich's record on jobs could be a key factor in whether he earns a second term in office. Kasich held an end-of-the-year session with reporters Dec. 19, 2011, that was designed to highlight his administration’s accomplishments and Ohio's limited economic recovery over the past year was front and center. As Kasich rattled off some statistics to bolster his case, he honed in on job creation -- a key measuring stick in a state where unemployment rates have hovered in the double digits in recent years. Kasich said Ohio is now on the comeback trail under his tenure. "We are now eighth in the nation in job creation...and No. 1 in the Midwest," Kasich told reporters. PolitiFact Ohio went to work to check out the governor’s claim. Kasich spokesman Rob Nichols told us the numbers came straight from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics employment data that serves as the baseline for the state's unemployment rate. Using the category of all non-farm workers adjusted for seasonal employment -- so that work done only part of the year, like summer lifeguards, aren't included -- we compared the number of jobs in Ohio in January 2011 when Kasich took office with where the numbers stood in late December when the November estimates were released. We found that Ohio was close to where Kasich had said -- 9th in the country in the raw number of jobs created with a net increase of an estimated 45,200 jobs this year. Ohio was also tops in the Midwest if you define the Midwest as the U.S. Census Bureau does: Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, Michigan, Wisconsin, Minnesota, Iowa, Missouri, Nebraska, North Dakota and South Dakota. (If you include Pennsylvania as a Midwest state Ohio would slip to No. 2.) But when you look at what states rank the highest in raw numbers of jobs created over that time frame, you begin to notice a common characteristic: they are predominately the states with the highest populations. By raw numbers the most jobs created were in California (193,800), Texas (158,300), Florida (120,200), New York (101,000), New Jersey (52,100), Massachusetts (50,000), Louisiana (49,700), Pennsylvania (45,400) and Ohio (45,200). And by population the biggest states are California, Texas, New York, Florida, Illinois, Pennsylvania and Ohio. The only state in the top seven in population to be outside the top 10 in job growth is Illinois, which is No.11 in raw number of jobs created with 38,100. When you hold steady for the relative population size of a state by looking at the new jobs created as a percentage of the state's workforce population, Ohio drops precipitously down the job creation ranks. In terms of relative job creation, Ohio has roughly 0.89 percent more people estimated to be in the workforce today than at the beginning of the year which is good for 22nd place among the 50 states. Once you hold equal for population, the top 10 job creation states become a mix of small, medium and big states: North Dakota (3.72 percent more workers than January 2011), Wyoming (2.64), Louisiana (2.63), Oklahoma (2.24), South Carolina (2.09), Utah (2.04), Arizona (1.74), Florida (1.68), Massachusetts (1.57) and Texas (1.51). Ohio's 22nd ranking would slot them in between West Virginia (0.98 percent) and Pennsylvania (0.80). And two other Midwestern states, by the U.S. Census definition, would top Ohio on a percentage basis -- South Dakota and Nebraska. Kasich spokesman Nichols argues that raw numbers are how job creation is commonly discussed and that because the Kasich administration spent so much time talking about the raw number of lost jobs under Strickland's watch that it should be how things are measured. "It's the very same yardstick we used during the election," Nichols said. While that is true, the context of Kasich's remark came when he was comparing Ohio to other states around the country trying to make the case that the Buckeye State was becoming a national leader in job creation. Ranking by percent increase of the workforce allows for an apples-to-apples comparison. The results give you a mix of states of all population sizes in the top 10. That's additional information that clarifies the claim and puts the job picture in better context. On the Truth-O-Meter, the governor’s claim rates Mostly True.

pomt-10108	"Sen. Obama's campaign announced that he's choosing his cabinet."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/oct/21/john-mccain/no-cabinet-picks-yet/	At a rally in Bensalem, Pa., John McCain accused Barack Obama of getting cocky. "We have 14 days to go. We're a few points down. The national media has written us off . . . Just the other day, Sen. Obama's campaign announced that he's choosing his Cabinet," McCain said at the Oct. 21, 2008, event. The remark invokes a theme from the McCain campaign that Obama has gotten overly confident. McCain and his surrogates have criticized (and sometimes ridiculed) the Obama campaign's use of an emblem that resembled the presidential seal on a lectern, and the campaign's use of large Greek columns as a backdrop for Obama's stadium speech to the Democratic National Convention. Rather than "a few points down," the latest Gallup poll showed McCain trailing by 10 points nationally; the latest ABC News/Washington Post poll had him down by 9 points. It's a matter of opinion whether the media "has written us off." There have been many news stories about how McCain has fallen behind, but most that we've seen have not said definitively that he will lose. For this item, we are exploring whether McCain was correct when he said that Obama "has announced that he's choosing his Cabinet." We have seen no such comment by the Obama campaign, nor could the McCain campaign provide one. Instead, the McCain campaign pointed to an Oct. 19 article in the Sunday Times of London that was headlined " Barack Obama lines up a cabinet of stars as John McCain struggles on ." The headline seems to indicate Obama is far along in his Cabinet-picking. But the story doesn't live up to the headline. The story is just another speculative account of what Obama might do if he is elected: "A host of well-known figures . . . have indicated they would be willing to serve in some capacity," the article says. It relies not on any "announcement" from Obama, but on unnamed sources such as "an Obama adviser" and "one leading Democrat policy adviser." The closest the article comes to an announcement from Obama himself is to quote his comment from the final debate that he would adopt a bipartisan approach to government and admired Republican Sen. Richard Lugar and Gen. Jim Jones, the former NATO commander. “Those are the people, Democrat and Republican, who have shaped my ideas and who will be surrounding me in the White House,” Obama said. But that's a long way from "announcing" that he was picking his Cabinet. In fact, it came in response to a question. The McCain comment is particularly silly because it's been widely reported that both campaigns have staffers planning a transition and exploring possible Cabinet choices. McCain's transition team is said to be headed by John F. Lehman Jr., a Navy secretary under President Reagan. William E. Timmons, a longtime Washington lobbyist, is also involved, according to an account in the New York Times . Obama's team is headed by John Podesta, a chief of staff under President Clinton. The Obama campaign declined to comment on transition plans and the McCain campaign did not reply to an e-mail about it. News accounts suggest that Obama's team is further along than McCain's but that both campaigns have begun preparations so they are ready in case they win. Clay Johnson III, deputy director of the White House Office of Management and Budget, told the New York Times that “the White House staff has met with transition representatives” for McCain and Obama. “Both campaigns are doing what they need to do to be prepared to govern on Jan. 20 at noon,” said Johnson, who was executive director of the Bush transition team in 2000-01. “The amount of work being done before the election, formal and informal, is the most ever.” But back to McCain's claim. Has Obama "announced that he's choosing his Cabinet"? He definitely has not. What's happening is the usual transition planning that occurs with any presidential campaign in the final days before an election. We find McCain's claim to be False.

pomt-08272	"The amount of the revenue required by the state (for the construction of high-speed rail) is around 10 percent."	mostly true	/florida/statements/2010/nov/09/bill-nelson/bill-nelson-says-feds-are-funding-most-proposed-ta/	Elected Democrats and Republicans are concerned that outsider Rick Scott's victory in the race for governor could doom a proposed high-speed rail line connecting Tampa and Orlando. So they're coming to the defense of the $2.654 billion rail line by noting that construction of the proposed rail line would mostly be paid for with federal dollars. Democratic U.S. Sen. Bill Nelson made the case to a group of 1,800 business leaders on Nov. 8, 2010, at an Orlando rail forum. "Let's ask the governor-elect not to return the $2 billion in federal funds the state so desperately needs," Nelson said. "The amount of the revenue required by the state is around 10 percent," Nelson said. "It could be one of the biggest boosts to the Florida economy since the location of Disney and the interstate highway system." Republican state Sen. Paula Dockery, a Scott adviser and rail supporter, also has said she hoped Scott would move forward with the rail project, noting that the project is estimated to create 5,000 jobs during the four-year construction period and that the rail line would employ 600-1,000 people once operational, and other spin-off jobs. We can't check the job creation figures, since they are estimates, but we can assess Nelson's claim that the state is on the hook for only around 10 percent of the cost to build the line. But first a little bit about the line itself, and why people are concerned Scott might kill the Tampa-to-Orlando project. Construction on the 85-mile rail line would link downtown Tampa with the Orlando International Airport and would begin in earnest in 2012 and be completed in 2015. The rail line would have five stations mainly along Interstate 4, and would include stops in Polk County, near Disney World and at the Orange County Convention Center. Plans call for purchasing five trains capable of holding 250 passengers that could make the entire trip in less than an hour at speeds of at least 168 mph. According to the state, a one-way trip from Tampa-Orlando is anticipated to cost $30 as a one-time fare, or less for regular users. The state also has plans for an $8 billion Orlando-Miami line, though no funding is in place. Scott has questioned the rail line publicly, first attacking his Democratic gubernatorial opponent Alex Sink for supporting the line without addressing how she'd pay for it, then saying the true cost to the state is unknown. Here's what he had to say about rail during the Oct. 25, 2010, CNN/St. Petersburg Times debate: "Every project we do, we have to get return for taxpayers," Scott said. "So, the way I look at it, on the high-speed rail, if the federal government is going to fund all of it, and there's no -- there's nothing the state -- going to cost the state any money, let's look at it. But let's look at a final feasibility study. Let's look at exactly what the state is responsible for. But if you're going to build an office building, you wouldn't ... go build half of it with the money and wait and see, hopefully, somebody is going to show up with the rest. We shouldn't be doing that with any projects like rail. "Let's make sure we have all of the money. Let's do a final feasibility study. Let's actually look at what the real return is," Scott added, saying he would put a hold on the project until he had all the data he needed. The fear from Nelson and others that Scott might kill the rail project was made more real when newly elected Republican governors in Wisconsin and Ohio said that they wanted to end rail projects in their states, saying the projects are a money pit. So how is the Tampa-Orlando line being paid for? In January, President Barack Obama announced that the rail line will receive $1.25 billion in federal stimulus dollars. Then in October, the federal government announced it was directing another $800 million to the project in transportation funds. As part of the $800 million award, the state pledged a match of $280 million. That's a total of $2.33 billion already committed to the project -- leaving a funding gap of around $325 million. Nazih Haddad, chief operating officer for the state Transportation Department's Florida Rail Enterprise, said the gap will hopefully be filled by additional federal dollars, or potentially private sector investment. "At this time, the state's contribution is limited to $280 million," Haddad said. If that's the case, the state will contribute $280 million for the construction of the $2.654 billion Tampa-Orlando line, or 10.55 percent. (So far it has pledged 12 percent of the $2.33 billion committed). The caveat, of course, is that the percentage neglects to account for how the remainder of the line will be funded. If the state was forced to pick up the rest of the costs, the state's share would rise to 22.8 percent. If the state was asked to pick up half of the remaining costs, the percentage contribution would increase to 16.7 percent. A quarter of the additional cost translates to a 13.6 percent share. And so on. State and federal officials, including Nelson, predict the federal government will fund much if not all of the cost remaining. But we're not willing to write the money off as a foregone conclusion. Haddad correctly clarified Nelson's comments. "If we are able to obtain the remaining money from federal sources, the total federal share will be approximately 90 percent with the state's share of a little over 10 percent," he said. Now, since we're talking about money, a quick word on the operation of the train. State officials say they will seek a partnership with a private operator to maintain and run the system, with each side sharing some of the risk. Still, the state estimates the system will turn a profit in its first year of operation. The system will cost $164,000 a day to run, but will generate $170,000 a day in revenues, and about 5,400 riders daily. (These, again, are figures we can't check since they're projections and estimates. Also, no word on how any profit would be shared). Back to Nelson's claim. He said the amount of revenue required by the state to build the Tampa-Orlando high-speed rail line is "around 10 percent." Nelson's point is largely right. The federal government to date has pledged $2.05 billion to the line compared to $280 million from the state. That puts the state on the hook for about 12 percent of the costs so far. But there is still a $325 million or so hole that needs to be filled. Depending on how the state, the federal government and possibly the private sector split that cost, the state's share could increase, or decrease. Until those checks are written, we think it's appropriate to rate this claim Mostly True.	None	Bill Nelson	None	None	None	2010-11-09T16:27:47	2010-11-08	['None']

pomt-07324	"We're within 600 miles of 60 percent of America. We're in a perfect location."	true	/ohio/statements/2011/may/13/john-kasich/gov-john-kasich-says-60-percent-us-population-with/	Location is commonly cited as the most important consideration in buying real estate, and geographic location was the reason that Cleveland once was tagged as being -- or occupying -- "the best location in the nation." The slogan was coined in 1944 by the Cleveland Electric Illuminating Co., now part of FirstEnergy Corp., to help build post-war business. "The claim was based on the fact that within 500 miles of the city lived half the people of the United States and Canada; that Cleveland was the natural meeting place of iron ore, coal, copper, gypsum, stone, sand and other vital raw materials; and that efficient water, rail, highway and air transportation facilitated delivery and reduced costs," wrote historians Carol Poh Miller and Robert Anthony Wheeler. The slogan has fallen into disuse, but geography hasn't changed. Gov. John Kasich touted the concept this month when he spoke to the Ohio Chamber of Commerce about making Ohio more competitive for business growth: "We're to the point now where location matters because logistics matters again," he said. "Cost of shipping things matters again. We're within 600 miles of 60 percent of America. We're in a perfect location." Given our Buckeye bias, PolitiFact Ohio wanted to believe it. But we have examined similar claims before and found them wanting. We knew that population has shifted since the 1940s, when the population center point of the entire nation (now in Missouri) was still in Ohio. But we also noted that Kasich moved the measuring stick from 500 miles cited in those previous claims to 600 miles. Using the tools we employed before, we built a map including all U.S. counties whose seats are located within 600 miles of Ohio's borders. We used U.S. Census Bureau data to calculate the aggregate population. We found that 184,900,000 people live within 600 miles of Ohio, or 59.9 percent of the U.S. population of 308.7 million. That's 60 percent, whether you round off by a number that is not statistically significant or factor a margin of error. The 600-mile reach would include nearly all of the Eastern Seaboard, the upper Midwest, much of the Deep South and some states west of the Mississippi River. One additional note: In addition to 60 percent of the U.S. population, Kasich’s claim also would encompass the most populous parts of Ontario and Quebec. We rate Kasich's statement as True.

pomt-03276	Says Houston National Cemetery is preventing Christian prayers from being said at military funerals.	false	/texas/statements/2013/aug/06/america/foramerica-says-houston-national-cemetery-preventi/	An image posted on Facebook by the conservative group ForAmerica says, "The Houston National Cemetery is preventing Christian prayers from being said at military funerals!" ForAmerica, which according to its website is a nonprofit organization headquartered in Reston, Va., urges Facebookers to "like" the image "if you agree this is wrong!" Well, turns out it is wrong -- just not in the way ForAmerica meant. "That’s an old story," Houston National Cemetery director Mat Williams told us by phone. "We got a bunch of calls about that. But it’s not true." ForAmerica spokesman Keith Appell told us the image and an accompanying blog entry, posted July 11, 2013, were based on a item posted the day before on the conservative Breitbart.com website and a July 9 report from the Family Research Council, a conservative, Christian group based in Washington, D.C. The Breitbart item and the council’s report said that on July 26, 2011, U.S. Rep. John Culberson, R-Houston, "determined that Houston National Cemetery was preventing Christian prayers from being said at military funerals." Such allegations about the 430-acre cemetery in northwest Houston resulted in legal action in 2011 that drew national attention, according to Houston Chronicle news stories from June 28, 2011, Sept. 22, 2011, and Dec. 12, 2011 and an Oct. 20, 2011, KHOU-TV news story. U.S. District Judge Lynn Hughes granted a temporary restraining order May 26, 2011, that allowed a pastor to deliver his Memorial Day invocation as written after the clergyman said then-director Arleen Ocasio told him not to say "Jesus Christ" in the service held at the cemetery, where nearly 70,000 service members and veterans and their spouses have been interred since its dedication in 1965. Ocasio, according to a Aug. 30, 2011, New York Times news story, "began enforcing a little-noticed 2007 policy that prohibits volunteer honor guards from reading recitations — including religious ones — in their funeral rituals, unless families specifically request them." U.S. Department of Veterans’ Affairs officials said the policy originated after "complaints about religious words or icons being inserted unrequested into veterans’ funerals," the Times story said. Later that year, the Chronicle reported, Veterans’ Affairs settled a lawsuit that alleged officials had told local veterans and volunteers not to use religious words such as "Jesus" and "God" during funerals at the cemetery. In the settlement reached Sept. 21, 2011, the VA did not admit fault but agreed not to interfere with religious speech at funerals unless relatives objected, according to the next day’s Chronicle news story. Since then, current cemetery director Williams said, "We haven’t had any incidents; no problems." U.S. Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee, D-Houston, and a Culberson aide have visited the cemetery, he said, and veterans are there every day: "If there was anything like that, they would be in an uproar. But no, it’s a phony story." Veterans’ families aren’t restricted from practicing any religion, he said. "It’s their service; they can do any religious ceremony they want." Leaders of Houston volunteer groups that were plaintiffs in the 2011 lawsuit gave us similar accounts. "Everything is running very smooth there. There are no problems," said Cheryl Whitfield, director of National Memorial Ladies, whose 34 members sometimes are, she said, the only mourners during funerals at the cemetery. "We attend all of the burials at Houston National Cemetery every day. There are anywhere from four to 12 a day. So we attend approximately 60 a week. And we give our condolences to the family," Whitfield told us by phone. "We use God’s name, we use Jesus’ name; we’re able to say anything to help console the family." Her group finds out in advance about relatives’ wishes regarding religion’s role in the funeral, she said. "We pretty well know ahead of time if they have an issue with us saying ‘God bless you’ or anything." The current commander of the Veterans of Foreign Wars district that brought the lawsuit, Bill Shaffer, told us by phone that he’s been with District 4 for about 16 years and knew of no such problems before or since the 2011 events. "I know we’ve had Jewish people, I know we’ve had Muslims, we’ve had Christian Science, Baptist, Catholic," he said. "We adhere to whoever it is. That veteran deserves his last rites and we go along with whatever the family wishes, and I just hope that the government continues to do that." The VFW has been a Christian organization since its founding in 1899, he said, and the team from District 4 that provides funeral honors performs a ritual that can include a 21-gun salute, presentation of the American flag, a chaplain and prayers. "It’s up to them. Whatever part of the ritual they want, we do," he said. "If they want the entire ritual, we do the entire ritual." ForAmerica spokesman Appell, when informed that we’d found no evidence Christian prayers were being prevented, told us the group "believed the information to be current." Our ruling ForAmerica said the Houston National Cemetery "is preventing" Christian prayer at military funerals. The group based its claim on recent online references to a congressman’s claim in July 2011. We found no current restrictions or even proof that anyone was stopped from saying a Christian prayer in the past. To the contrary, volunteers and the current cemetery director told us Christian prayers are welcome. We rate ForAmerica’s statement as False.

pomt-10498	Obama "has no experience or background at all in national security affairs."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/apr/03/john-mccain/saying-no-experience-is-no-fair-/	Commenting on Sen. Barack Obama's proposal to leave a "strike force" of U.S. troops in the Middle East after a withdrawal from Iraq, Sen. John McCain belittled his potential rival for the White House, saying Obama had no expertise in the area of national security. "I think somebody ought to ask what in the world (Obama's) talking about, especially since he has no experience or background at all in national security affairs," McCain said in an interview on MSNBC's Morning Joe program. As a Vietnam war hero and senior member of the Senate Armed Services Committee who has played a key role in most major debates on the war and the military, McCain might feel justified in delivering such a broad swipe. He's not the only candidate to go down this road; before bowing out of the race, former Democratic contender Joe Biden, the senior senator from Delaware, incorrectly said Obama hadn't passed any bills in the Senate. We ruled that statement False. McCain is exaggerating, too. In his three years in the Senate, Obama has dealt with substantial issues such as nuclear proliferation as a member of the Foreign Relations Committee and also participated in debates on the Senate floor and within the Democratic caucus on the war strategy, proposed timetables for troop withdrawals and the U.S. response to the 2006 conflict between Israel and Hezbollah. That national security experience might not match up to McCain's lengthy resume, but it's arguably more than George W. Bush brought to the White House after he was elected president in 2000. One of Obama's biggest legislative accomplishments in the national security arena came in 2006 when he helped write an exemption to the 1954 Atomic Energy Act allowing the United States to export to India civilian nuclear power technology, including nuclear fuel and reactors. The move was seen as cementing relations with an emerging power without endangering longstanding non-proliferation policies. Bush, in signing the bill in December 2006, praised it for "lay(ing) the foundation for a new strategic partnership between our two nations that will help ease India's demands for fossil fuels and ease pressure on global markets." In 2005, Obama and then-Senate Foreign Relations Chairman Richard G. Lugar, R-Ind., toured a weapons destruction facility in the Ukraine where the United States was taking the lead in a three-year NATO program to destroy small arms, shoulder missile launchers and other supplies often sought by terrorists. The pair later collaborated on an effort to triple spending for programs to counter the spread of conventional weapons, but the bill never made it to a Senate vote. In 2005, Obama also participated in a more parochial national security debate, arguing against the Base Realignment and Closure Commission's decision to move some operations at the Rock Island Arsenal in his home state of Illinois to military installations in Texas. It's true that Obama's freshman rank and committee assignments didn't throw him in the middle of the national security fray, and it's true that his background is no match for McCain's. But to say he has absolutely no national security background or experience is an overstatement. For this reason we rule McCain's statement to be False.

pomt-14880	"There are more words in the IRS code than there are in the Bible."	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/nov/10/ted-cruz/ted-cruz-says-us-tax-code-has-more-words-bible/	During the Republican presidential debate in Milwaukee, Ted Cruz compared two volumes -- one beloved by many, the other loathed by almost everybody. "There are more words in the IRS code than there are in the Bible -- and -- and not a one of them is as good," Cruz said. Our New Jersey affiliate checked a similar claim on length in 2013, so we’ll apply their research to Cruz’s claim here. How long is the tax code? A 2010 report by the Internal Revenue Service’s Taxpayer’s Advocate Office found that the tax code contained 3.8 million words. That calculation was made by downloading a zipped file of the code, unzipping it and running it through Microsoft Word’s word count feature, according to a footnote in the report. A 2012 version of the report puts the number of words in the code at "about 4 million." We also reached out to CCH, the Riverwoods, Ill.-based publisher of the two-volume 2013 Winter version of the tax code and was told the best estimate of word length was 4 million. That was two years ago, but we think it’s a safe bet that the length of the tax code has only increased since then, not decreased. How long is the Bible? Dennis Olson, the Charles T. Haley professor of Old Testament Theology at the Princeton Theological Seminary, told PolitiFact New Jersey that a fair approximation of the Bible’s length is 800,000 words for the Old and New testaments combined. "The King James Version would be 823,156 while the more recent New Revised Standard Version would be 774,746 words," Olson said. Hellen Mardaga, an assistant professor of New Testament at Catholic University in Washington, agreed that estimates that put the Bible at 800,000 words were credible. Put it all together and the tax code is roughly five times as long as the Bible. So Cruz is correct. Our ruling Cruz said, "There are more words in the IRS code than there are in the Bible." It’s generally accepted that the tax code is about 4 million words long and that the Bible is about 800,000. That’s five times as long. So Cruz’s claim is True.

pomt-11888	Says the GOP plan he supports is "the biggest tax cut in U.S. history."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2017/oct/26/donald-trump/donald-trump-wrong-his-tax-plan-biggest-cut-ever/	Over and over again, President Donald Trump has touted his tax proposal as the biggest ever. On Oct. 25, he tweeted, "Working hard on the biggest tax cut in U.S. history. Great support from so many sides. Big winners will be the middle class, business & JOBS." See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com That same day, he told Lou Dobbs of the Fox Business Network, "We’re bringing the corporate rate down to 20 percent from 35 percent. ... This will be the biggest tax cut in history. In the history of our country." See Figure 4 on PolitiFact.com But is it? Tax experts say no. (The White House did not respond to our inquiry.) The current tax proposal is still a work in progress, but the Senate budget resolution allows it to reduce federal revenues by $1.5 trillion over 10 years. An estimate by the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget suggests that, when all is said and done, the reduction in tax revenues will increase to $2.2 trillion over 10 years. So based on what we know now, the tax proposal will probably amount to between $150 billion and $220 billion per year. That doesn’t stack up as the largest cut ever. The Treasury Department has published a list of the biggest tax bills between 1940 and 2012, measured not only by contemporary dollars but also by inflation-adjusted dollars and as a percentage of gross domestic product — two metrics that experts say give a sense of scale. Depending on what projection of the current bill you use and what yardstick you measure it by, at least one tax bill on the Treasury list, and possibly others, were larger. Here’s the list by inflation-adjusted dollars: Tax bill Inflation-adjusted dollars American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 (enacted in 2013) $321 billion Tax Relief, Unemployment Insurance Reauthorization, and Job Creation Act of 2010 $210 billion Economic Recovery Tax Act of 1981 $208 billion Current tax proposal $150 billion - $220 billion Revenue Act of 1964 $64 billion Revenue Act of 1945 $60 billion Revenue Act of 1978 $55 billion Revenue Act of 1948 $38 billion At least the 2013 bill -- and possibly the 2010 and 1981 bills -- exceeded the current bill in inflation-adjusted tax cuts, depending on what figure you project for the current bill. And here are the tax laws ordered from highest to lowest as a percentage of GDP: Tax bill Percentage of GDP Economic Recovery Tax Act of 1981 2.89 percent Revenue Act of 1945 2.67 percent Revenue Act of 1948 1.87 percent American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 (enacted in 2013) 1.78 percent Revenue Act of 1964 1.6 percent Tax Relief, Unemployment Insurance Reauthorization, and Job Creation Act of 2010 1.31 percent Current tax proposal 0.8 percent-1.2 percent Revenue Act of 1978 0.8 percent By this measurement, at least six bills cut taxes by more than the current proposal. A seventh, the Revenue Act of 1978, is essentially tied with the current proposal as a percentage of GDP. The Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget has noted that an even earlier tax cut, from 1921, accounted for 1.1 percent of GDP. The group added in a blog post that "if President Trump wanted to pass a tax cut that exceeds the record 2.9 percent of the economy in 1981, it would cost roughly $6.8 trillion over ten years." No formulation of the current proposal is close to that. "Unless lawmakers scrap their current plans for tax reform and start over from scratch, it’s simply implausible to claim that this legislation will provide the largest tax cut in U.S. history," said Joseph J. Thorndike, director of the Tax History Project at the group Tax Analysts. Our ruling Trump said the GOP tax plan he is supporting is "the biggest tax cut in U.S. history." Even the most expansive estimate for the current proposal’s tax cut is exceeded by the 1981 tax cut in inflation-adjusted dollars. And as a percentage of GDP, a half-dozen or more previous tax cuts were larger. We rate the statement False.

pomt-05152	Says President Obama's new immigration plan "is amnesty."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/jun/20/jim-demint/immigration-plan-enforcement-amnesty/	After President Barack Obama unveiled a new immigration plan for young people who came to the U.S. illegally, it didn't take long for opponents to criticize the plan with a familiar word: amnesty. Sen. Jim DeMint, a Republican from South Carolina, responded with a press release that said Obama's action on undocumented youth "is amnesty." That was echoed by other Republicans such as U.S. Rep. Lamar Smith of Texas, who said "President Obama's decision to grant amnesty to potentially millions of illegal immigrants is a breach of faith with the American people." The Obama plan, which does not require congressional approval, allows young people who came here illegally to apply for temporary relief from deportation. In a memo, Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano gave immigration officers the leeway to grant that relief for up to two years at a time. They also can approve work permits. Obama said it was the right thing to do for the economy and because "we are a better nation than one that expels innocent young kids." He said, "This is not amnesty. This is not immunity. This is not a path to citizenship. It’s not a permanent fix. This is a temporary, stopgap measure that lets us focus our resources wisely while giving a degree of relief and hope to talented, driven, patriotic young people." In this fact-check, we'll examine whether it is accurate to call the new Obama plan "amnesty." DeMint’s spokesman, Wesley Denton, says the matter is straightforward. "When people who are here unlawfully are told by the government that they will not be prosecuted and instead given a legal status and work permits, that’s amnesty," Denton says. In the immigration debate, there is no word more loaded than amnesty. PolitiFact has done many fact-checks on various uses of the word and found it is more accurate when it’s applied to policies that lead to permanent legal status. A tweet from Georgia congressman Paul Broun during the 2011 State of the Union address saying Obama "is calling for amnesty" took a rating of Half-True. While it lacked some necessary qualifiers, it referred to the president’s support for the DREAM Act, a bill that offers the possibility of citizenship. It’s helpful to look at the legal definitions of amnesty. Black’s Law Dictionary defines it as "a sovereign act of pardon and oblivion for past acts, granted by a government to all persons who have been guilty of crime." The Legal Dictionary at the FreeDictionary.com offers more background and notes that "an act of amnesty is generally granted to a group of people who have committed crimes against the state." It gives the example from 1977 when President Jimmy Carter granted amnesty for Vietnam War draft dodgers. Overall, you can break amnesty into two elements, and it’s the second that really matters. It applies to a group of people who have broken the law. And it says to those people, you are permanently free from punishment for your offense. The new Obama policy matches up on the first part but not the second. "It does not forgive anything, nor does it create any new rights," says Muzaffar Chishti, director of the New York office of the Migration Policy Institute, a nonpartisan research group that is supported by groups such as the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, the Carnegie Corporation and the World Bank. Chishti emphasizes, "You are still subject to deportation if the the government decides to do that." While some have said any relief from legal action is amnesty, whether it lasts for two years or forever, Chishti said the temporary nature of the Obama plan makes it significantly different than true amnesty. Indeed, the legal definitions provide examples where amnesty is permanent immunity from punishment. Chishti’s group estimates that about 1.4 million undocumented residents would be eligible under the new program. How many actually come forward might depend on their assessment of the risks. Ben Johnson, Executive Director of the American Immigration Council, a group that supports the move by Obama, agreed with Chishti's point that the policy offered people only temporary relief. He said anyone applying under the program has to understand that they will be giving immigration officials a lot of personal information. "Two years from now, they might be more vulnerable" to deportation, Johnson said. But there's also the practical definition of amnesty. If the ax of deportation never falls, critics of the administration ask, was it ever really there? The Homeland Security memo lays out a program that would grant deportation relief for two years at a time, renewable for as long as the applicant is under 30 years old, after which they would no longer qualify for deferral. During that time, the person could, at local discretion, be granted a work permit. While the White House made much of the temporary nature of the policy, Mark Krikorian, executive director of the Center for Immigration Studies, which supports low levels of immigration, isn’t buying it. "There’s nothing as permanent as a temporary status," Krikorian says. He and other opponents of this approach to young illegal immigrants can’t imagine that after encouraging people to come forward and allowing them to work, the government would then turn around and deport them. Still, we find it's a stretch to describe an enforcement plan as amnesty, a legal term that connotes broad and permanent protection. The people who are accepted into Obama's plan might not be deported immediately but they still could be in the future. Our Ruling DeMint and other critics say the Obama plan is amnesty, but the facts of the plan indicate it's an exaggeration to describe it that way. Legally, amnesty focuses on a group of people and grants them a permanent pardon. The Obama administration’s policy could reasonably be said to focus on a group, but deferring deportation is not the same as forgiveness and the relief it offers is limited in time. Concerns about where this policy might lead are a valid topic for discussion, but go beyond what the policy actually says. We rate the claim Mostly False.

Asked about achieving energy independence, the former Republican governor called for several initiatives, including converting semitrailer trucks and buses so that they can burn compressed natural gas rather than diesel fuel. After all, Thompson reasoned: "We have more natural gas, ladies and gentlemen, than Saudi Arabia has oil." We do? It turns out another GOP politician recently preceded Thompson down this road. Let’s see where it’s led them. Jon Huntsman, the former presidential candidate and Utah governor, also referred to new sources of energy when making the same claim Thompson did during a GOP presidential debate in December 2011. PolitiFact National rated his statement Mostly False, given that it is off based on two of three ways to measure the question. 1. In terms of proved resources -- those likely to be developed under current economic and operating conditions -- Saudi Arabia’s oil reserves are far larger than U.S. natural gas reserves. 2. Saudi Arabia also comes out ahead when considering technically recoverable resources -- those that could be developed using current exploration and production technology, without regard to cost. 3. The U.S. leads Saudi Arabia only when comparing current production levels -- the U.S. produces more natural gas every year than Saudi Arabia produces oil. Even at that, reserves are more relevant than current production in terms of moving America toward energy independence. The U.S. Energy Information Administration provided the statistics used by PolitiFact National. We checked back with the agency, which confirmed that each of the three statistics remains true. Back to Thompson. Thompson campaign spokeswoman Lisa Boothe said Thompson "clearly meant to say was that we produce more natural gas in this country every year than Saudi Arabia produces oil." We don’t think it is so clear, given that Thompson made no mention of production. Our rating Thompson stated: "We have more natural gas than Saudi Arabia has oil." The U.S. produces more natural gas than Saudi Arabia produces oil. But in terms of reserves -- those that are proved and those that are technically recoverable -- Saudi Arabia leads.

pomt-06177	"Speaker Gingrich has said that we ought to get rid of our child labor laws."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/dec/14/mitt-romney/romney-gingrich-wants-scrap-child-labor-laws/	Newt Gingrich has a bold solution for helping kids in poor communities climb out of poverty: put them to work. The Republican presidential candidate and current front-runner in many polls suggested, in a Q & A with students at Harvard University Nov. 18, that poor children should be paid to work as janitors in their schools to learn a work ethic and begin to rise to prosperity. "Get any job that teaches you to show up on Monday. Get any job that teaches you to stay all day, even if you’re having a fight with your girlfriend. I mean, the whole process of making work worthwhile is central," the former House speaker said. Gingrich has taken considerable heat over his comments, and in an interview with Fox News on Dec. 6, his Republican rival Mitt Romney highlighted the issue as one on which he and Gingrich differ. "Speaker Gingrich has said that we ought to get rid of our child labor laws. That, I think, is a mistake," Romney told Fox’s Carl Cameron. Ditching the nation’s child labor laws would be a radical move. We wanted to know if that’s what Gingrich is really proposing. What he said At Harvard, a female freshman stood and asked Gingrich what he proposes to do about growing income inequality and declining social mobility in America. Gingrich cited three main factors that have caused the inequality -- the collapse of the housing market, which took much of middle-class America’s wealth with it; a decline in manufacturing jobs, which he blames on government policies; and an education system that fails poor kids while cutting off other pathways out of poverty. "Core policies of protecting unionization and bureaucratization against children in the poorest neighborhoods crippling them by putting them in schools that fail has done more to create income inequality in the United States than any other single policy" he said. "It is tragic what we do in the poorest neighborhoods entrapping children in, first of all, in child laws which are truly stupid. Okay, you say to somebody, ‘you shouldn’t go to work before you’re what, 14, 16 years of age. Fine. You’re totally poor. You’re in a school that is failing with a teacher that is failing.’ "I tried for years to have a very simple model. Most of these schools ought to get rid of the unionized janitors, have one master janitor, and pay local students to take care of the school. The kids would actually do work, they would have cash, they’d have pride in the schools, they’d begin the process of rising. "You go out and talk to, as I do regularly, talk to people who are really successful in one generation. They all started their first job between 9 and 14 years of age. They all were either selling newspapers, going door to door, they were doing something. They were washing cars. They all learned how to make money at a very early age. What do we say to poor kids in poor neighborhoods? Don’t do it. Remember all the stuff about don’t get a hamburger-flipping job -- the worst possible advice to give to poor children. "Get any job that teaches you to show up on Monday. Get any job that teaches you to stay all day, even if you’re having a fight with your girlfriend. I mean, the whole process of making work worthwhile is central." His remarks generated a lot of buzz, and Gingrich addressed the issue again at a campaign stop in Des Moines, Iowa on Dec. 1. "You have a very poor neighborhood. You have kids who are required under law to go to school. They have no money. They have no habit of work. What if you paid them part time in the afternoon to sit in the clerical office and greet people as they came in? What if you paid them to work as the assistant librarian? And I'd pay them as early as is reasonable and practical." "Then we get down to the janitor thing," Gingrich continued, in reference to his previous comments. "(I received) letters written that said janitorial work is really hard and really dangerous and this and that. OK, fine. So what if they became assistant janitors and their job was to mop the floor and clean the bathroom. And you paid them." On Dec. 6, in a radio interview with host Curtis Sliwa on WNYM-AM 970, Gingrich further clarified what jobs he thinks young kids should and shouldn’t have. "They could be the person who greets you when you walk in the door," Gingrich said, according to POLITICO. "They could help in the school library. They can help in the kitchen. They can help clean up after lunch." "Kids shouldn't work in coal mines, kids shouldn't work in heavy industry," he said. What the law says Child labor laws are contained in the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938. According to the Department of Labor, the laws "were enacted to ensure that when young people work, the work is safe and does not jeopardize their health, well-being or educational opportunities. These provisions also provide limited exemptions." The law establishes that minors be paid minimum wage, sets hours that 14- and 15-year-olds can work (i.e., not after 7 p.m. except in the summer) and prohibits youths from working in places like mines, factories or boiler and engine rooms. They are permitted to do office work, kitchen cleaning, cashiering, bagging and customer carry-out. (Our favorite exemption: "the making of wreaths composed principally of natural holly, pine, cedar, or other evergreens.") Based on Gingrich's remarks, he doesn't appear to have any desire to do away with the law's provisions banning youngsters from dangerous workplaces. His argument, instead, seems to be with restrictions on younger children working. Gingrich’s side R.C. Hammond, Gingrich’s campaign spokesman, said the point of Gingrich’s idea is "to instill a work ethic in every youngster." "To help you start off on the right foot and be successful in life, it’s helpful to start work early," Hammond said. "The point that Newt was making is that public schools should make opportunities to go to work. It could be anything, and it’s pretty much on par with whatever your first summer job was." (Hammond’s first job: camp counselor. Gingrich's, in Stuttgart, Germany, where his father was serving in the Army, was at a bowling alley that didn’t have an automatic pin replacer. "They hired Newt to go and replace the pins that had been knocked down," Hammond told us.) So was Romney correct that Gingrich wants to do away with the existing law? "Any characterization that doesn’t encompass what we just discussed is inaccurate," Hammond said. Other perspectives Jeffrey Miron, a Harvard University economics lecturer and senior fellow with the libertarian Cato Institute, said he thought saying Gingrich wants to get rid of the law "seems a little broad brushed and overly strong. It would be a weakening of child labor laws." But that might not be all bad, he said. "For some families it would be nice if another $10 or $20 a week came in, and I think that parents are better at making those decisions than a blanket rule," he said. "Why should it be the government’s business?" We talked to other experts on child labor who said that the changes to the law Gingrich has talked about probably would do more harm than good. Eric Edmonds, a Dartmouth College economics professor and author of the book Child Labor and the Transition Between School and Work, recently wrote about Gingrich’s take on child labor. "The issue is that workers that start unskilled stay unskilled. Especially if their education is suffering as a result. Working children do not learn skills that are going to help them to succeed in today’s technologically advanced global economy. How is learning to be an unskilled laborer at an early age going to help families in the long-run?" Edmonds wrote. "It is not ... We’ve seen what happens when successive generations of families need their children to work. They are unable to escape poverty." Hugh Hindman, a professor of Labor & Human Resources at Appalachian State University, said Gingrich is not the first leader to recommend child labor as an anti-poverty program, but that it doesn’t work. "It has never worked to alleviate poverty, except in the very short-term, and it exacerbates poverty in the longer term. There is a phenomenon known as the ‘child labor trap’ … very poor parents send their children to work as household survival strategy. Consequently the children forfeit schooling and fail to acquire the human capital that would qualify them for anything other than low-wage work as adults. These become the very poor parents of the next generation who send their children to work as household survival strategy. And on again into the next generation," Hindman said. He added that jobs such as babysitting that Gingrich mentioned are beneficial for young people, but the opportunity to do them are "skewed in favor of middle and upper-middle class children." "If Mr. Gingrich could find a way to provide more poor children with these sorts of opportunities, he might well do some good," Hindman said. "There’s not a golf course (in their neighborhoods)," said Harvard's Miron, "but there’s a grocery store down the street that needs boxes stacked or the sidewalk swept." Our ruling Romney said, "Speaker Gingrich has said that we ought to get rid of our child labor laws." We found that Gingrich has proposed some unconventional changes to child labor legislation, which he called "truly stupid." Specifically, he said that kids younger than 14 growing up in poverty should be allowed to work as a means of elevating themselves. But he also clarified that children shouldn’t hold mining or industrial jobs. While Gingrich appears to be in favor of easing age restrictions on working, he has given no indication that he wants to "get rid of" many other provisions, such as those that prohibit kids from working in certain dangerous occupations. On balance, we rate Romney’s statement Mostly False.	None	Mitt Romney	None	None	None	2011-12-14T11:29:25	2011-12-07	['Newt_Gingrich']

pomt-03166	"We will have the highest general revenue in state history next year. Conservative pro-growth policies work in our state."	mostly false	/florida/statements/2013/sep/06/rick-scott/rick-scott-says-next-years-record-tax-collections-/	Florida is set to collect more tax money next year than ever before, state officials say. And not only is Florida Gov. Rick Scott proud of the accomplishment, he is taking credit. "After right-sizing government and cutting taxes, this year we had our first budget surplus in six years," Scott told conservatives gathered in Orlando for an Americans for Prosperity Foundation summit on Aug. 30, 2013. "It gets better: Our state revenue estimating conference says we will have the highest general revenue in state history next year. Conservative pro-growth policies work in our state." Scott’s right: State economists (the wonkishly called revenue estimating conference) say tax collections in the 2014-15 fiscal year will be higher in sheer dollars than ever. But crediting "conservative pro-growth policies" for the extra flow of money is a conclusion that ignores trends nationwide, as PolitiFact Florida found out. Future tax collections The state’s revenue estimating conference, one of 10 consensus estimating conferences, is comprised of members from the governor’s office, the Legislature and its research arm, the Office of Economic and Demographic Research. They meet throughout the year to come up with a best guess for how much money the state can spend. It’s an important job because Florida is required to balance its budget each year, so lawmakers need to have a good accounting of how much money is available. You can think of the state budget, which has grown to over $74 billion, as a three-legged stool. The first leg is what we’re talking about in this fact-check, general revenue. That money can be spent pretty much on anything because it’s the money the state most directly controls. The second leg is trust funds, or money that is collected for a specific purpose. A good example is the tolls you pay on Florida roads that are then earmarked specifically for road projects. The third leg is money that comes from the federal government and also has a specific purpose (Medicaid funding, for example). Amy Baker, director of the Office of Economic and Demographic Research, confirmed Scott’s claim about general revenue for fiscal year 2014-15. According to projections, the state is expected to collect a record $27.3 billion. The pot has not been this large since the 2005-06 budget year, when collections totaled $27.07 billion. However, it's not a record when adjusted for inflation. Revenue projections for 2014-15 are significantly lower than revenues in the 2005-06 fiscal year and slightly lower than revenues in the 2007-08 fiscal year, said Chris Mai, a research assistant at the State Fiscal Project at the left-leaning Center for Budget Policies and Priorities. "That same amount of money in nominal terms is not enough to provide the same services -- education and health care -- as in 2008," said Elizabeth McNichol, a senior fellow at the center. Where does that money come from? Most states collect an income tax, but Florida does not. It leans heavily on its 6 percent base sales tax. Other big taxes that go into state general revenue include the corporate income tax, beverage and tobacco taxes, and documentary stamp taxes, which are based on real estate transactions. Florida’s sales tax collections are climbing primarily because of growth in personal income, population and tourism, Baker said. Even though year-over-year population growth is not as high what it was before the recession, it’s finally going up. That means there are more people to spend money on big-ticket items, such as houses, cars, appliances and, yep, Disney World tickets. That includes the first wave of baby boomers retiring nationally, many of whom are young, have cash to spend and are moving to Florida, said Karen Woodall, executive director of the left-leaning Florida Center for Fiscal and Economic Policy. To try to associate that tax revenue growth with Scott’s conservative policies, the governor’s office directed us to a Moody’s Investors Services report that praised Florida’s fiscal management, including building up rainy-day reserves. The report predicted the state would likely outpace the nation in long-term growth because of its climate and low cost of living, "as well as strong demographic and economic fundamentals, driven by the tourism, health care, and education sectors." Yet, Moody’s said, the construction and real estate markets remain a drag on Florida’s economy, and the state is more vulnerable than the rest of the country if a new housing bubble emerges from outside investors. "Florida’s difficulty in the last few years doesn't stem from its tax code," said Lyman Stone, a state tax economist at the business-backed Tax Foundation. "It stems from having a real estate- and construction-driven economy in a real estate- and construction-driven recession." So what does more revenue mean? Collecting a record amount of money is a sign Florida’s economy is en route to normalcy, which in Florida, translates to more people moving into the state and good tourism figures. But in the larger picture, Florida is not that special. The slow-and-steady recovery story is the same for most of the country, experts told us. In fact, several other states -- and plenty run by Democrats -- are doing better. Most states returned to or exceeded 2008 revenue levels by the 2012-13 fiscal year, said Todd Haggerty, policy analyst for the Fiscal Affairs program at the National Conference of State Legislatures. The growth continued for 33 states in 2013-14, though at a more modest clip. Not every state has released 2014-15 revenue expectations. Of those that have, 26 states and D.C. project revenue growth between 0.1 and 5 percent, Haggerty said. That's where Florida falls, along with New York and Texas. That's behind a group of 11 -- Arizona, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Hawaii, Idaho, Maine, North Dakota, Ohio, Oregon and Vermont -- that expect growth between 5 and 10 percent. The NCSL does not examine in-depth why revenue is growing in each state, Haggerty said, though he noted some states (California) increased tax rates while others benefited from an energy boom (North Dakota). "Given that the revenue recovery is happening in almost every state, it’s pretty clear that it’s a general trend," McNichol said. No one can fault Scott for talking up the state as a tourism and business mecca. But could he bring about record-setting tax collections through a toolbox of tax cuts and shrinking government, or as he put it, "conservative pro-growth policies?" Even economists on the conservative side are skeptical. "We think certainly he’s doing the right things from an economic standpoint," said Kurt Wenner, vice president of tax research at Florida TaxWatch. "But it’s certainly hard to dial a direct relationship between how much revenue comes from that." Stone of the Tax Foundation pointed to a few examples of tax breaks passed under Scott that are "straight-up revenue losses," such as the four-day sales tax holidays and an assortment of tax credits. Other longer-lasting, pro-business cuts are more likely to have economic benefits in the future, he said, such as temporarily removing a sales tax on machinery and equipment for manufacturers, removing businesses from the corporate income tax roll, and reducing unemployment compensation taxes. (The temporary tax cut for manufacturers won’t even take effect until 2014.) "I’m skeptical that these changes drove a big enough economic recovery in revenue changes," Stone said. Our ruling Scott said that Florida "will have the highest general revenue in state history next year. Conservative pro-growth policies work in our state." Scott's statistic is wrong if you account for inflation. But the bigger issue is that Scott overreaches by connecting the revenue resurgence with conservative policies. The trajectory is not unique to Florida, or conservatives. There’s an element of truth to this statement but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression.

pomt-02480	"When the Dallas/Fort Worth Airport needed to stop its earthquake spike a few years ago, they temporarily shut down the wells that were injecting fracking fluid into the ground ... (and) those earthquakes stopped."	true	/punditfact/statements/2014/feb/19/rachel-maddow/msnbcs-maddow-earthquakes-led-texas-airport-close-/	If couples in Central Oklahoma felt the earth move on Valentine’s Day, it might not have been passion. Five earthquakes hit the area last Friday, followed by a sixth the next day. The quakes weren’t big. The strongest measured 3.5 on the Richter scale, but all of them were over the threshold to get residents’ attention. Rachel Maddow noticed as well. The MSNBC host linked the flurry of seismic activity to the region’s sizeable number of wells used to dispose of waste from oil and gas hydraulic fracturing, or fracking. Oklahoma has about 6,000. There are many clustered in the county where the quakes took place. Maddow suggested that Central Oklahoma take a tip from Texas. "When the Dallas/Fort Worth Airport needed to stop its earthquake spike a few years ago," Maddow said, "they temporarily shut down the wells that were injecting fracking fluid into the ground at high pressure on the airport property, and lo and behold, those earthquakes stopped." A reader asked us to see if that is true. We can report that it is. "It’s an accurate assessment," said Dave Magana, the senior manager for public affairs at the airport. In fracking, operators pump water and chemicals into the ground to release oil and natural gas. When those fluids come back to the surface, the wastewater is moved to a disposal well where it is pumped back deep into the Earth. In 2008, the airport had leases with the Chesapeake Energy company for two such wells. One of them was near an old inactive fault line. The wells became active in September 2008 and the first earthquake came in October of that year. Brian Stump, a seismologist at Southern Methodist University, was part of a team that studied what was going on. "Based on the timing and the location of the earthquakes, there was a plausible linkage," said Stump. Dallas-Fort Worth managers took Stump’s report to heart. "The airport asked Chesapeake to close the well, and they did," Mangana said. The earthquakes stopped. The well in question has remained inactive, although a second well on airport land continues to operate. Fracking and its environmental impacts are a contentious issue. A study from the National Academy of Sciences did not find that getting natural gas this way led to "induced seismic activity." However, it did conclude that disposal of wastewater "does pose some risks." Our ruling Maddow said, "When the Dallas/Fort Worth Airport needed to stop its earthquake spike a few years ago, they temporarily shut down the wells that were injecting fracking fluid into the ground ... (and) those earthquakes stopped." An airport official confirms Maddow's story, aside from the fact that it was one well. Officials at the airport asked that a well be shut down, and after it was, the earthquakes eventually stopped. Seismologists linked the well to the earthquakes. We rate the claim True. Update: This item was updated on Feb. 24, 2014, to make clear that airport officials asked Chesapeake Energy to shut down the well.

pomt-00770	Says Hillary Clinton "erased all of her emails even though they were subject to recall and review by Congress."	mostly false	/punditfact/statements/2015/apr/12/mitt-romney/mitt-romney-said-hillary-clinton-deleted-emails-we/	Hillary Clinton’s announcement that she would run for president was met with a round of attacks from Republicans on the Sunday shows. Taking up the cause on Fox News Sunday was 2012 Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney. "You've seen in polls and in discussions across the country a feeling that Hillary Clinton is just not trustworthy," Romney said April 12, 2015. "This whole story about her having erased all of her emails even though they were subject to recall and review by Congress, I think that's made people remember that with the Clintons, it's always something." We have dissected before the web of laws and regulations that surround Clinton’s use of a private email account as Secretary of State. For this fact-check, we look at Romney’s claim that she erased all of her emails when they should have been kept for use by Congress. A review of the facts shows Romney had a point, but he mangled the details. A quick recap In March, the public learned that instead of using a State Department email account when she was in charge, Clinton ran all of her email through a private server in her New York home. When State Department officials asked for copies of her government-related emails late last year, Clinton’s staff went through her files and sent over about 30,000. According to Clinton, about an equal number of emails were judged to be personal and were erased. Specific to Romney’s statement that Clinton erased all of her emails, there is no question that she preserved and delivered thousands to the State Department. Clinton has said that all of this was in line with federal regulations. We have found that it isn’t so cut and dried. The National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) oversees federal recordkeeping, and its code requires federal agencies to keep records that document agency activity so that they are readily available when needed -- such as for Freedom of Information Act requests or congressional inquiries. However, not all records need be retained. Agencies have the discretion to delete material that is deemed to have no value. The laws are tighter today than when Clinton was secretary, but even during her tenure, her sole reliance on a private email account skirted the law, experts tell us. "The key thing is that while use of a personal account was not prohibited, exclusive use of it was," said Daniel Metcalfe, professor of law at American University and former director of the Department of Justice’s Office of Information Policy. With a State Department email account, all of Clinton’s emails would have been stored on a government computer. Any researcher or government body would then have access, pending the normal privacy and security reviews. (That said, the department preserves relatively few emails.) Clinton’s private email account changed the process completely. She, not a government worker, had control over the emails, and even though emails she sent to government workers would have been saved under their email accounts, searching those records would be infinitely more complicated. Romney’s botched wording The legal experts we reached said Romney’s use of the phrase "recall and review by Congress" is ambiguous. (We tried to reach Romney for clarification and did not hear back by the time we published. If we learn more, we will update this fact-check.) Jason R. Baron is a lawyer at Drinker Biddle and Reath and a former director of litigation at the National Archives and Records Administration. Baron told PunditFact that in the most literal sense, Congress plays no role at all in deciding what materials should be preserved when an official leaves office. "This is an executive branch function," Baron said. "In most agencies when a senior official leaves, there is a protocol to review the documents that the official might have. The Federal Records Act doesn’t expect Congress to review anything." On the other hand, Congress has the right to subpoena records as part of an investigation and congressional committees have been investigating the deaths at the American compound in Benghazi, Libya. This might be what Romney had in mind. But if he did, that makes his point even harder to prove. Douglas Cox is a law professor who specializes in government records law at the City University of New York. Cox said Romney is on thin ice if he meant that Clinton ducked a congressional subpoena. "Clinton has stated that she turned over to the State Department any records responsive to congressional subpoena at the time," Cox said. "An allegation that she destroyed records subject to subpoena is a serious one, and it is speculative absent more specific evidence." Baron raises one legal wrinkle that might bolster Romney’s claim. He said it’s possible that Clinton had a reasonable expectation that a committee might want to dig further. Baron said in the private sector, if you think that a future lawsuit might call for certain records, you should keep them. "If I were her lawyer, I would have told her that it would be prudent to preserve any evidence that might be subject to a congressional inquiry," Baron said. Regardless of the legal arguments on that score, Baron said he believes that what Clinton did -- stepping down without a department review of her records and then unilaterally deleting some -- was inconsistent with the spirit if not the letter of the Federal Records Act. Cox shares that view, even as he discounts Romney’s statement. "Clinton's decision to destroy all emails that she and her private attorneys unilaterally decided were not federal records is both shocking and suspicious," Cox said. "But the problem is that not all of her emails were ‘subject to recall and review by Congress.’ There is plenty of justifiable criticism for Clinton's actions, but that does not appear to be one of them." Our ruling Romney said that Clinton "erased all of her emails even though they were subject to recall and review by Congress." Romney got it wrong when he spoke of all of her emails. We know that about 30,000 emails were turned over to the State Department. Romney’s words about recall and review by Congress are ambiguous. In terms of preserving records, legal experts agree that Congress has no direct role. That is a function of the executive branch. In terms of a congressional investigation, a legal expert told us Clinton did respond to congressional subpoenas, and there is no proof she destroyed evidence subject to a congressional investigation. Romney’s statement contains an element of truth -- Clinton did delete some emails -- but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression. We rate it Mostly False.

pomt-03398	Says $800,000 cost of Texas special legislative session would pay for 1.6 million condoms, 90,000 months of the pill or 20 full-time sexual health educators.	mostly true	/texas/statements/2013/jul/03/sarah-ponder/austinite-says-800000-cost-special-session-could-p/	Amid thousands of protesters at the Texas Capitol, Sarah Ponder of Austin carried a sign with a financial comparison: "$800,000: 1.6 million condoms, 90K months of the pill, 20 full-time sexual health educators or 1 medically unnecessary & hypocritical special session," it read. The July 1, 2013, rally took place the first day of the 2013 Legislature’s second special session, called by Gov. Rick Perry after a filibuster and demonstrators kept legislation restricting abortions from winning final Senate approval. Ponder, who works for an education technology company, said she wanted to show that the money likely to be spent on the special session could instead pay for measures she said would be more effective at reducing abortions: providing substantial contraception aids or paying 20 educators’ salaries for a year. We shopped around, comparing the costs of a special session to Ponder’s alternatives. Cost of a special session In a June 26, 2013, news story Ponder sent us, Waco ABC affiliate WXXV-TV said, "Each special session could cost taxpayers more than $800,000," based on per-diem payments to legislators to cover their food and expenses. Other news stories we found typically gave either a per diem cost of $800,000, a per diems-plus-overhead cost of $1 million or both. Per diems are the biggest cost of Texas special sessions, which can last up to 30 days. At the current per diem rate of $150, with 182 lawmakers eligible (31 senators, 150 representatives and the lieutenant governor), 30 days of payments would equal $819,000. Not all lawmakers take the payments, though. June 18, 2013, news stories from the Dallas Morning News and Houston Chronicle indicated that during the year’s first special session, six or eight senators and 26 House members declined some or all of the payments. Dewhurst spokesman Travis Considine told us by phone that Dewhurst turned down all per diem payments for both special sessions. If 33 lawmakers rejected the payment on days their chambers did not convene, the state might have shelled out $716,100 on per diems during the session. Other costs bring the total up. Legislative Budget Board staff spokesman John Barton told us by email that, wrapping in overhead costs such as utilities, security, printing and staff support, a 30-day special session could cost $1 million to $1.2 million. The pill Ponder emailed us a March 12, 2012, news story from The Week, a news magazine, that said generic-drug versions of birth control pills cost $9 a month and brand-name pills cost $90 a month. The National Campaign to Prevent Teen and Unplanned Pregnancy offers information at bedsider.org on the availability and costs of contraceptive options. The group is a nonprofit that produces research frequently used by teen pregnancy prevention organizations. The campaign’s site gives the same $9-$90 range cited in The Week’s article, with explanatory details. Oral contraception pills, containing hormones that prevent egg production or fertilization, are usually taken once a day. "A woman without insurance using generic birth control pills will typically pay about $25 a month," according to the site. The group’s chief program officer, Bill Albert, told us by phone that information on the site is updated and current. With Medicaid or private insurance, according to the site, women can get the pill free or for just the cost of their co-pay (the fixed amount an insured patient pays out-of-pocket each time he or she gets a medical service). "For most people," the Bedsider article said, the co-pay "ranges from $5 to $35." Federal funding makes free or low-cost pills available to many, the site said. Without insurance, generic pills at pharmacies can cost $10-$20 a month, the site says, or $20-$30 a month from Planned Parenthood, with name-brand pills selling for $60-$90 a month at pharmacies. The site says its information came from a survey of Planned Parenthood clinics and birth control manufacturers. Condoms Ponder told us she chose an average cost per condom of 50 cents by looking at items for sale on Amazon.com. Bedsider.org gives prices from a survey of online retailers: 30 cents to $1.54 apiece for male condoms at national chain pharmacies and 18 cents to 60 cents apiece at Walmart. As with the pill, the site said, condoms can be obtained for free or at reduced costs at clinics. But also as with the pill, there are more expensive options available. In a December 2009 article, Consumer Reports rated 22 types of condoms on strength, reliability and whether holes were present in the material; the best seven ranged from 71 cents to $1.10 each. To check options that are widely available, we visited a CVS pharmacy on South Congress Avenue and found prices from 79 cents to $4.35 apiece. Sexual health educators Ponder said she estimated from personal knowledge that the annual salary of an entry-level sexual health educator at a nonprofit organization might be about $35,000 to $40,000. Francine Gertz, human resources manager for the City of Austin’s health and human services department, told us by phone that the city employs health educators in programs such as its adolescent health initiative, which according to its website provides education and presentations for students, parents and others. The entry-level salary for a first-level public health educator -- a job that requires a four-year degree and two years of experience -- is $40,000, Gertz said, and a second-level public health educator with 13 years of experience might earn $54,000. Texas Workforce Commission spokeswoman Lisa Givens suggested by email that we look at a couple of the federal government’s occupation categories. One was "health educators," which encompassed broad job titles such as community health worker and narrow ones such as early breastfeeding care specialist. According to the federal Bureau of Labor Statistics’ website, most people employed in this category nationwide earned about $53,000 a year as of May 2012. Job search website Indeed.com, whose data has been cited by Forbes and U.S. News and World Report magazines, says the average annual salary for a "sexual health educator" in Texas is $50,000 (compared with $52,000 nationally). Such averages are based, the site says, on "salary information extracted from over 50 million job postings from thousands of unique sources over the last 12 months." Adding up our results Now, let’s take another look at that sign. A 30-day special session might cost $716,100 to $819,000 in per diems alone; Ponder assumed an $800,000 cost. And how do the alternative expenditures on her sign price out? Like Ponder, we found estimates saying a month of oral contraceptive pills could cost $9 to $90, but we also read that a typical cost would be $25. Ponder went with the $9 figure and said $800,000 would buy 90,000 months of pills. We calculate that $800,000 would pay for 88,900 months of pills at $9 or 32,000 months at $25. That’s a difference of 4,700 years. To phrase it another way, $800,000 would buy 32,000 women a month’s worth of pills at $25 or 88,900 women’s pills for a month at $9. Condoms, Ponder estimated, would cost about 50 cents on average. With $800,000, we calculate, you could indeed provide 1.6 million 50-cent condoms. Using Bedsider.org’s range, we figure $800,000 would buy 2.7 million condoms at 30 cents each or 520,000 condoms at $1.54 each. To predict that $800,000 would pay for 20 full-time sexual health educators, Ponder said she estimated an annual salary for an entry-level position at a nonprofit at $35,000 to $40,000. That doesn’t contradict what we found, because the salaries we gathered covered a spectrum, from $40,000 for a city job requiring two years’ experience to $54,000 for veteran educators. We calculate that $800,000 would pay 20 educators at $40,000 or 16 educators at the Texas average salary of $50,000 listed by Indeed.com. Our ruling Ponder used a conservative estimate for the cost of the second special session, presuming it runs for the full 30 days. She used the lowest price we found for the pill, a mid-range price for condoms and a salary that doesn’t seem out of line for an entry-level sexual health educator position, so it’s probably true that under certain circumstances, you could pay for the items on her sign with $800,000 apiece. Then again, it might be fairer to estimate the pill at $25 a month instead of $9, which means you could only pay for 32,000 months of contraception, not the 90,000 months she cited. And unless you only wanted to hire newly-graduated sexual health educators, you might have to pay them more like $52,000 per year, which would cover 16 instead of 20 educators. So an adjusted version of the sign might read: "$800,000: 1.6 million condoms, 32,000 months of the pill, 16 full-time sexual health educators" instead of "$800,000: 1.6 million condoms, 90K months of the pill, 20 full-time sexual health educators." We rate Ponder’s claim as Mostly True.	None	Sarah Ponder	None	None	None	2013-07-03T14:58:02	2013-07-01	['Texas']

pomt-03591	Says "we" have put more boots on the U.S.-Mexico border "than at any time in our history, and illegal crossings are down by nearly 80 percent from their peak in 2000."	half-true	/texas/statements/2013/may/13/barack-obama/obama-says-record-level-boots-ground-near-us-mexic/	In his weekly radio address May 4, 2013, President Barack Obama revisited an administration message that tends to draw attention in Texas. "The truth is, right now, our border with Mexico is more secure than it’s been in years," Obama said. "We’ve put more boots on that border than at any time in our history, and illegal crossings are down by nearly 80 percent from their peak in 2000." Obama went on to extol a developing Senate effort to overhaul immigration laws, potentially enabling U.S. residents lacking federal permission to be here to qualify for citizenship. We've explored proclamations about border security before. For this article, we wondered about Obama’s references to boots on the ground and illegal crossings. Boots on the border By email, Heather Wong, a spokeswoman for the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, pointed us to a Border Patrol chart indicating that in the fiscal year that ended Sept. 30, 2012, the agency had 18,516 agents stationed in its Southwest sector, which sweeps in the southern border region. Those agents, up by 10 from the year before, comprised 87 percent of 21,394 agents nationally, according to the chart, which indicated the 2012 count in the border region was at least greater than at any time since 1983, the earliest year shown, when there were about 3,500 agents in the region of about 4,000 nationally. In the year that began Oct. 1, 2012, the chart indicates, the nation’s total number of Border Patrol agents dipped 2 percent to 21,394. As PolitiFact has noted before, the biggest bump in Border Patrol staffing came under Obama’s predecessor, President George W. Bush. Between 2001 and 2009, Bush’s tenure, the number of agents posted nationally rose from about 9,800 to a little more than 20,000. In May 2011, PolitiFact quoted Jack Martin of the Federation for American Immigration Reform, which supports stricter illegal immigration guidelines, as saying: "There has been a steady buildup of BP officers for several years given impetus by the 9/11 attacks." We’d snap-shut this portion of our review except the country has historically put boots on the ground near the southern border for other reasons, as PolitiFact colleagues have explored. There was the Mexican-American War of 1846 and the lesser known Mexican Expedition of 1916. Should those military activities count as "boots on the ground" on the border? Our thinking is that neither event quite matches modern-day circumstances. The Mexican-American War was a war that happened after the United States annexed Texas in 1845, making it more of a battle to define the border than defend it. At first glance, the Mexican Expedition seems a bit different. Those events occurred during the Mexican Revolution, when Pancho Villa launched a surprise attack inside the United States at Columbus, N.M. History books say that President Woodrow Wilson sent somewhere between 75,000 and 150,000 troops to the border in 1916, far more personnel than the Border Patrol has ever dispatched. But historians previously told PolitiFact the Mexican Expedition isn't directly comparable with the 21st-century border situation. "During the Mexican insurrection, Pancho Villa raided into U.S. territory. It was, then, not about attempts by Mexicans to get into the U.S. individually for various personal reasons, or drug smuggling, etc.," Richard H. Kohn, a professor emeritus of history at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, said by email. Clemson University historian Paul Christopher Anderson agreed that current concerns with immigration are very different from worries of the early 1900s. "The U.S. involvement on the border and in Mexico from 1913 to 1917 was tied primarily to questions of diplomacy, imperialism and Mexican sovereignty," he said by email. Illegal crossings Setting aside boots, are illegal crossings of the border down nearly 80 percent from 2000? It’s impossible to pinpoint that, given that the crossings are often secretive. Homeland Security’s Wong offered an indirect indicator, U.S. Border Patrol apprehensions, which in the year that ran through September 2012 totaled nearly 365,000, the government says, which was 78 percent less than the nearly 1.7 million apprehensions in fiscal 2000. That percentage reduction in apprehensions also occurred in the region near the U.S.-Mexico border. A Border Patrol chart shows that while 2000 was the latest peak year for apprehensions, 1986 was the overall peak year; the agency that year reported 1.69 million apprehensions, a tally not topped by the 1.68 million apprehensions 14 years later. Then again, another chart shows there were nearly 28,000 fewer apprehensions in the southern border region in 1986 than in 2000, when the 1.64 million apprehensions set a record for the Southwest sector. Apprehensions near the border have not exceeded 1 million since 2006, the chart indicates, and they decreased every year from 2006 through 2011 when they totaled 327,577, the least apprehensions in the sector since 1972. In 2012, the nearly 357,000 apprehensions in the region reflected a one-year uptick of 9 percent. We asked Homeland Security if this means there also was a recent increase in illegal crossings. Homeland Security spokesman Peter Boogaard emailed us a statement attributed to Michael Friel, a spokesman for U.S. Customs and Border Protection, that did not address our question head-on. Friel said the agency has noted increased apprehensions in South Texas, particularly of individuals from Central American countries. Increases in manpower and technology, Friel said, give the agency confidence it’s apprehending more illegal border crossers. Linking boots on the border to illegal crossings Generally lower levels of apprehensions are one thing. But do they signal the extent of illegal crossings, what Obama highlighted? By email, Boogaard called Border Patrol apprehensions the "best measure of illegal or illicit border crossings." When demographers try to measure the number of people crossing the border illegally, they usually refer to the net flow -- arrivals to the United States minus departures. Lately, that number has been essentially a wash, according to statistics from the Pew Hispanic Center. In its April 2012 report, the Pew center estimated that between 2010 and 2011, the number of immigrants from Mexico declined so much that the flow into Mexico was bigger than the flow out of Mexico for the first time since "probably in the 1930s," Jeffrey S. Passel, senior demographer for Pew, told PolitiFact in October 2012. Still, apprehension statistics are an imperfect gauge of population flow, since they can be affected by the magnitude of the border patrol effort. Passel said that while this statistic is not a "direct measure of flow across the border," it is "widely accepted as an indicator of the magnitude of the flow." There is disagreement, at least, over how changes in enforcement levels near the border affect illegal crossings. Passel has said that Obama has a point that law enforcement -- something the president has influence over -- has a major impact. "We know from various surveys that the cost of hiring a smuggler to get into the U.S. has increased significantly as enforcement has been ramped up," he said. "We also know that Mexicans have been pushed into more remote areas to try to cross where it is physically more difficult and dangerous." But Doug Massey, a professor at Princeton University's Office of Population Research who has studied immigration issues, considers the economy the overriding factor. The recession, he said, had an immense effect on border crossings. Dwindling prospects of finding a job in sectors such as construction, which traditionally attract a disproportionate number of Latinos, dampened the urge for potential Mexican migrants to undertake a difficult journey, Massey said. Massey, saying the government could achieve substantial savings by reducing border patrols, has called intensified border enforcement "counterproductive. Rather than discouraging the entry of undocumented workers, it lowers their rate of departure and thereby raises net immigration," he wrote in a 2007 paper. In a 2011 book, Massey attributed the reduction of undocumented migration to near zero to a combination of "harsh enforcement, expanding guest worker migration and economic turmoil." Finally, as PolitiFact colleagues have noted, other significant factors have been out of Obama’s control -- namely, the state of the economy in Mexico (which has been relatively healthy) and the activity of the drug cartels (which has increased violence on the Mexican side of the border). Our ruling Obama said: "We’ve put more boots on" the U.S.-Mexico "border than at any time in our history, and illegal crossings are down by nearly 80 percent from their peak in 2000." There are more Border Patrol agents than ever along the border and while there once were more troops there, we do not see those military pursuits as comparable to existing day-to-day border enforcement. But the claim has other flaws. For starters, most of the surge in agents that Obama said "we" put on the border occurred under Bush. Also, there is no count indicating illegal border crossings are down nearly 80 percent. Obama evidently put a fine point on an indirect indicator, Border Patrol apprehensions, which were 78 percent lower in the border region in 2012 than in 2000, the year the Southwest sector experienced its peak level of apprehensions. Finally, his statement fails to acknowledge there is at least debate over whether economic conditions, rather than enforcement, drive ebbs and flows in such migration. Notably, too, those conditions aren’t independently controlled by any president. There is sufficient missing context here to make Obama’s claim Half True.

pomt-09522	"We have killed lots of innocent people in the state of Texas."	false	/texas/statements/2010/feb/13/farouk-shami/farouk-shami-says-state-texas-has-killed-lots-inno/	At a televised debate Monday, Democratic gubernatorial candidate Farouk Shami said he opposes Texas continuing the death penalty as things stand. "If we are 110 percent that that person deserved death, I would support it, yes," Shami said. "Not as it currently stands, absolutely not. We have killed lots of innocent people in the state of Texas." His declaration prompted us to take a closer look. The state of Texas hasn’t admitted putting even one innocent person to death. Still, Shami’s campaign suggested the candidate’s claim was backed up by the Death Penalty Information Center, a nonprofit clearinghouse that has written reports critical of the death penalty. Online, the center lists five individuals executed by the state of Texas from 1989 through 2004 as "possibly innocent." Shami spokeswoman Kelly Johnson said the list justifies Shami’s declaration that the state has put lots of innocent people to death. "Farouk believes that one innocent man put to death is too many," Johnson said. "Therefore the five listed on the deathpenaltyinfo.org Web site constitute ‘lots.’" Of course, the center’s description is "possibly" innocent—not "certainly." Steve Hall, who helms the StandDown Texas Project, a group that seeks a moratorium on executions in Texas, acknowledged: "No executed Texas death row inmate has been proved innocent beyond anyone’s doubts." Still, Hall told us he believes innocent people have been put to death in Texas. He singled out post-execution investigations by journalists that suggest three men -- Todd Willingham, Carlos DeLuna and Ruben Cantu -- were not guilty of the charges that led to their executions. News reports have aired questions about the original investigation leading to the conviction of Willingham of murder after a 2001 house fire killed his children. He was executed in 2004 after Gov. Rick Perry did not act on an outside expert’s challenge of the original investigation’s arson findings. DeLuna was executed in 1989 for killing a convenience store clerk despite claims by his lawyer at trial that authorities had mixed him up with another man (who died in prison in 1999). The other man’s relatives and friends later recalled him boasting about getting away with the murder, according to articles published in The Chicago Tribune in 2006. Cantu was executed in 1993 for a 1984 murder. News reports later quoted both the only eyewitness at trial and another convict saying Cantu, a juvenile at the time of the crime, was not the perpetrator. In 2005, The Houston Chronicle quoted Bexar County’s district attorney from the time of Cantu’s trial expressing second thoughts. Sam D. Millsap Jr., who had made the decision to charge Cantu with capital murder, told the Chronicle he never should have sought the death penalty in a case based on the testimony of an eyewitness who identified Cantu only after police officers showed him Cantu's photo three separate times. "It’s so questionable. There are so many places where it could break down," Millsap told the newspaper. "We have a system that permits people to be convicted based on evidence that could be wrong because it's mistaken or because it’s corrupt." It's possible, as Shami said, that Texas has put innocents to death--conceivably "lots" of them. Nationally, the death penalty information center writes, "there is no way to tell how many of the over 1,000 people executed since 1976 may also have been innocent. Courts do not generally entertain claims of innocence when the defendant is dead. Defense attorneys move on to other cases where clients' lives can still be saved." But without a state-approved review, perhaps, it’s a reach to say such executions have happened for a certainty. Shami could have said it’s possible that innocent convicts have been executed or that the topic bears careful study. He asserted much more than that. We rate his statement as False.

pomt-13425	"We had the Democratic Governors Association and the Obama political machine come into a Republican primary to try and rig the election by spending $1 million against me in the last couple of days."	mostly true	/missouri/statements/2016/sep/21/eric-greitens/greitens-claim-democrats-investing-primary-checks-/	Republican gubernatorial candidate Eric Greitens claims Democrats spent $1 million against him just before the August primary election. On an Aug. 11 Fox & Friends appearance, Greitens said, "We had the Democratic Governors Association and the Obama political machine come into a Republican primary to try and rig the election by spending $1 million against me in the last couple of days." That number stood out, so we decided to investigate the claim. We reached out to Greitens' campaign staff for more information. Parker Briden, a campaign spokesman, said Greitens was referring to television attack ads aired against Greitens right before the primary. Campaign finance records Briden referred us to Missouri campaign finance reports filed by the Chris Koster campaign detailing contributions from Jobs and Opportunity, a political action committee. Koster won the Democratic primary for governor and will square off against Greitens in the general election in November. Beginning two weeks before the Aug. 8 primary, the PAC made four "in-kind" contributions — contributions of goods and services and not cash — to Koster for Missouri, Koster's campaign. The in-kind contributions carried a total valuation of over $1 million, according to the reports filed by the Koster with the Missouri Ethics Commission. The largest contribution was reported as $713,082, made on July 29. The same week, two other contributions were made — one valued at $112,560, and another for $150,080. On Aug. 5, three days before the election, the committee made a final contribution valued at $25,710.82. After the donations were made, the Greitens campaign issued a press release titled "Koster Caught in Conspiracy to Hijack Republican Primary." "This is an attempt by national Democrats to steal an election in Missouri through meddling in the Republican primary," the release read. Attack ad The reported contributions coincided with a series of television ads attacking Greitens that aired in the five days before the primary. A group called Jobs and Opportunity is credited for paying for the ad. A YouTube video of the ad was posted on July 29, about a week before the primary. According to Koster's campaign finance expenditures, his campaign normally pays between $500,000 and $700,000 for media advertising. No other single campaign expenditure comes close to that amount. That puts the PAC's contribution in perspective — it's unlikely a $1 million in-kind contribution would buy anything else. The ad lambastes Greitens for accepting a separate $1 million contribution from Michael Goguen, a California-based tech financier. Goguen is the subject of a pending civil lawsuit with a woman who has accused him of sexual abuse. "While others returned his money, Greitens says he's honored to take it," the ad's narrator says. Greitens is right: the Democratic Governors Association is behind money given to his Democratic opponent. The Washington, D.C. address for Jobs and Opportunity that the Koster campaign reported to the Missouri Ethics Commission is also the address for the Democratic Governors Association. A week before the election, Jobs and Opportunity made a $1 million in-kind contribution to Koster, which coincided with a TV ad attacking Greitens. Although the political action committee is unaffiliated with Koster’s campaign, Koster's campaign had some knowledge of the ad before it aired, since the in-kind contribution was listed on Koster's campaign finance report. PACs that act independently from a candidate do not have to report contributions to that candidate's campaign, said James Thomas, the campaign treasurer for Catherine Hanaway, who was a Republican gubernatorial candidate in the primary. But when the PAC is in contact with the candidate, related contributions need to be reported. For example, the PAC could have discussed when the ad's content or when it would be aired with Koster's campaign, Thomas said. Since Missouri has no limits on campaign contributions, it's okay that the PAC talked to Koster's campaign. It would be a different story if this were a federal election, though, Thomas said. Federal PACs can only contribute $5,000 to a candidate, so Jobs and Opportunity’s $1 million in-kind contribution would be illegal. On July 31, Greitens released an ad in response to the PAC's ad. In the ad, which has since drawn national attention, Greitens fires rounds of a machine gun into an open field. "Eric Greitens is under attack from Obama's Democrat machine," the narrator of the ad says. "When he fights back, he brings out the big guns." After the primary, Greitens said no other Democratic groups launched attack ads against any other Republican gubernatorial candidate, according to the Associated Press. We also asked Austin Chambers, Greitens' campaign manager, why Greitens repeatedly cited President Barack Obama's involvement in the ad buy. Chambers said the company the PAC hired to purchase the airtime for the ad is the same Obama has used for his ads. The company, named GMMB, produced ads for Obama during both of his presidential campaigns. And though Koster's donations were big, they were legal, despite Greitens' press release connoting Koster's involvement in illegal activity. Koster's campaign directed all questions to the spokesman for the PAC. Marvin Overby, an MU political science professor, said large donations like the PAC's are common before an election. "This happens a lot. It's just part of the rough and tumble of politics," he said. "I'm not sure the Greitens' campaign wouldn't have done the same thing." Our ruling Greitens said the Democratic Governors Association and "the Obama political machine" spent $1 million against him leading up to the primary election. A PAC with the same address as the Democratic Governors Association made four in-kind contributions totaling that amount in the weeks leading up to the election. And though both Obama and the PAC hired the same company to work on their ads, there's no evidence to support Greiten's statement that the "Obama political machine" colluded with the PAC. We rate this claim as Mostly True.	None	Eric Greitens	None	None	None	2016-09-21T01:13:01	2016-08-11	['Republican_Party_(United_States)', 'Barack_Obama']
pomt-11893	On NFL players protesting during the national anthem.	half flip	/wisconsin/statements/2017/oct/25/scott-walker/scott-walker-flips-hard-nfl-protests/	Responding to the controversy over NFL players kneeling or sitting during the national anthem, Green Bay Packers players issued a statement saying the "NFL family is one of the most diverse communities in the world." We found mixed evidence on that claim. The next day, on Sept. 27, 2017, Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker was asked in Green Bay about the protests. He didn’t say what the protesting players should be doing. But less than a month later, the Republican governor, who is widely expected to run for a third term in 2018, was sending a different message. Which means it’s time to turn to our Flip-O-Meter, which assesses whether a politician has been consistent on an issue. Three Walker statements, and a mobilization effort, are key. They show the governor pivoting from a hands-off position to telling the NFL players exactly what they should do during the anthem. He also suggested the players instead take a stand against domestic violence, even though the protests have centered on racial inequality and police brutality. 1. ‘They should have to explain’ Walker was asked by a reporter in Green Bay on Sept. 27, 2017: "You don’t find it disrespectful what’s happening, entering this political debate to sports? He said: "Well, again, I’ll let others explain what they’re doing it and why they’re doing it. I just know in my household, my kids were always taught, as I was always taught, you stand and put your hand over your heart ….Now, part of those rights are the right to protest, so others can do that. But then they should have to explain why they’re doing that." So, he made no direct statement to what players who had been protesting should do. 2. ‘Time for players in the NFL to stop their protests during the anthem’ In a letter Walker sent to the NFL and its players union, Oct. 16, 2017, Walker wrote: "A lot has been made about National Football League players protesting by kneeling, remaining in the locker room, or other means during the national anthem. Speaking up for what you believe in is a profoundly American idea, but disrespecting our flag, and the men and women who have fought to protect and defend our country, is not American in the slightest. "It is time for players in the NFL to stop their protests during the anthem and move on from what has become a divisive political sideshow …. "My request is simple: Stand for the American flag and the national anthem out of respect for those who risk their lives for our freedoms, and then take a stand against domestic violence to keep American families safe." Walker then repeated his call for the protests to end. 3. ‘It’s simple: Stand up’ In an interview on the "Fox & Friends" talk show on the Fox News Channel on Oct. 23, 2017, Walker said: "For the NFL, it’s simple: Stand up, put your hand over your heart. Do what Americans are taught to do, like we were taught to do in my family and I passed on to my kids. When the national anthem is played, stand up and show respect for the men and women who are currently in harm’s way, as well as all those great veterans who fought for that flag. If you want to speak out on something else, do it at a different time in a different platform …." 4. Mobilization Two days after the Fox interview, Walker’s campaign announced an online petition and digital ad campaign "to build pressure on the NFL and its players to stop protesting the national anthem and flag." So, Walker had gone from not directly addressing the players who were protesting to trying to mobilize Americans against them. Worth noting Walker has made it a point to underscore his new position. The anthem controversy had begun to die down when Walker took the step of sending his letter. And Walker’s campaign organization highlighted the governor’s statements about it on "Fox & Friends," issuing a news release saying that he had "urged" players to stand, and starting the mobilization effort. There appears to be a wider political connection. The day after Walker released his letter, the Republican Governors Association, of which Walker is chairman, sent out a fundraising solicitation announcing "I Stand" bumper stickers were available in exchange for a campaign contribution to the association. The email says the stickers are available for a donation of $5 or more. The liberal advocacy group One Wisconsin Now pointed out the timing. Our rating Walker initially didn’t tell NFL players what they should do, but he did note the right to protest. Less than a month later, he said: "It is time for players in the NFL to stop their protests during the anthem," and he asked the players to stand during the pre-game playing of the anthem. Then Walker went further, saying: "For the NFL, it’s simple. Stand up, put your hand over your heart." Finally, his campaign launched an online petition and digital ad campaign to pressure the players to stop their protests. On the Flip-O-Meter, our ratings are No Flip, Half Flip or Full Flop. For a partial change in position, we give Walker a Half Flip. div class='artembed'>See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com	None	Scott Walker	None	None	None	2017-10-25T05:00:00	2017-10-24	['None']
pomt-04095	The United States has "an immigration system where only 6.5 percent of people who come here, come here based on labor and skill."	mostly true	/florida/statements/2013/jan/16/marco-rubio/marco-rubio-says-only-65-percent-immigrants-come-h/	Florida Sen. Marco Rubio is a key to the Republicans’ hope to capture more of the Hispanic vote in 2016. And to achieve that goal, Rubio -- a potential presidential contender -- wants to be the face of the GOP’s immigration plans. Rubio unveiled his plan for immigration legislation in the Wall Street Journal on Jan. 12. Rubio’s plan calls for allowing more immigrants into the country who bring investment or skills, a guest-worker program for farm laborers and a path to citizenship for certain people in the United States illegally. Rubio sees his immigration plan as something that can spur economic growth. "I'm a big believer in family based immigration," Rubio told the Journal. "But I don't think that in the 21st century we can continue to have an immigration system where only 6.5 percent of people who come here, come here based on labor and skill. We have to move toward merit and skill-based immigration." That precise figure -- 6.5 percent -- caught our attention, so we decided to check it out. Brookings policy brief Rubio obtained the 6.5 percent figure from a January 2011 policy brief from the Brookings Institution, a centrist think tank. The author, Brookings vice president Darrell West, called for immigration reform that in the short term would allow employers to hire workers with scientific and technological skills. West argued that some other countries such as Canada have already crafted policies to attract skilled and unskilled workers. Canada gives applicants points based on their field of study, education and employment experience. "Some 36 percent of all Canadian immigrant visas are in the ‘skilled-worker’ category, as opposed to only 6.5 percent in the United States," West wrote. We contacted West to ask how he arrived at his figure. West told us in an email that there are different numbers depending on the immigrant category and the definition of skilled workers. The U.S. Department of Homeland Security publishes numbers that relate to "legal permanent residents" and how many are family sponsored or employment-based. "But even those numbers are not exact, because the employment category combines skilled and unskilled workers," West wrote. "My 6.5 percent figure was my best approximation of the conflicting numbers that exist in this area." We looked at the numbers ourselves and found the vast majority of immigrants are accepted for family unification and a smaller slice are for employment, though the numbers vary depending on the type of visa and employment. West’s number drew from a group known as legal permanent residents. In 2011, a total of 1,062,040 persons became legal permanent residents. Family sponsored was the largest category for people who earned this status in 2011. Employment-based preferences accounted for 13.1 percent. The U.S. Department of Homeland Security provides a breakdown for people receiving the employment-based preferences. "Professionals with advanced degrees" accounted for 6.3 percent. Another category combined "skilled workers, professionals and unskilled workers," and that accounted for 3.5 percent. (The combined category makes it difficult to pluck out a number for only "skilled" workers.) The 2011 Yearbook of immigrant statistics shows that within those employment categories, the numbers reflect not just workers, but their spouses and children. Our ruling In an interview on reforming our immigration system, Rubio said "I'm a big believer in family based immigration. But I don't think that in the 21st century we can continue to have an immigration system where only 6.5 percent of people who come here, come here based on labor and skill. We have to move toward merit and skill-based immigration." Rubio pulled his number from a 2011 Brookings paper that said, "Some 36 percent of all Canadian immigrant visas are in the ‘skilled-worker’ category, as opposed to only 6.5 percent in the United States." Immigration data shows that most people come here for family reasons. The number of legal immigrants who come based on an employment varies depending on the type of visa and category of employment. But one valid example is to look at legal permanent residents -- 13.1 percent were employment-based preferences in 2011, and professionals with advanced degrees accounted for 6.3 percent. The data isn’t as precise as Rubio makes it sound, but his basic premise is correct, and some numbers do support his claim. We rate this claim Mostly True.

pomt-03745	Says Obama called Medicaid "broken" four years ago.	mostly true	/texas/statements/2013/apr/09/rick-perry/rick-perry-says-obama-called-medicaid-broken-four-/	"If you don’t believe me that Medicaid is broken, just ask our president," Texas Gov. Rick Perry told the Conservative Political Action Conference on March 14, 2013. "Four years ago, he said, and I quote, ‘We can't simply put more people into a broken system that doesn't work,’ end quote." In Perry’s speech at the American Conservative Union’s annual gathering of activists, he described Medicaid as "on its way to bankruptcy" and vowed he wouldn’t join other Republican governors who had gotten on board with Obamacare’s expansion of the state-federal program, which insures low-income Americans. But did President Barack Obama say it was "broken"? An Internet search will quickly enough direct the curious reader to Obama’s remark, made June 2, 2009, at the White House before a health-care discussion with Senate Democrats. Between the quotation marks Perry indicated, he captured Obama’s words; here we present them with more context: As we move forward on health care reform, it is not sufficient for us simply to add more people to Medicare or Medicaid to increase the rolls, to increase coverage in the absence of cost controls and reform. And let me repeat this principle: If we don't get control over costs, then it is going to be very difficult for us to expand coverage. These two things have to go hand in hand. Another way of putting it is we can't simply put more people into a broken system that doesn't work. So we've got to reform the underlying system. And this means promoting best practices, not just the most expensive practices. (Click here to read Obama’s full speech, and here to watch Perry’s speech.) Perry spokesman Josh Havens confirmed by email that the governor was referring to this Obama speech, and pointed out a precedent in Obama’s 2006 book, "The Audacity of Hope": As initially passed in 2010, Obamacare would have required states to expand Medicaid by opening the program to all households with income below 138 percent of the federal poverty level — which in 2013 is $15,865 for an individual, $32,499 for a family of four. A June 2012 Supreme Court decision gave states the choice to opt in or opt out of expanding their Medicaid rolls, which is the decision Texas currently faces. But much more was at stake in mid-2009. Obama’s health-care overhaul would not pass the Senate until Dec. 24, 2009; the House passed it March 21, 2010. A CNN timeline shows Obama had told Congress in February 2009 that health care reform would not wait another year and held a White House summit on health care in March 2009. In June 2009, Obama launched what news stories in the Washington Post, New York Times and other papers described as a full-on push to get comprehensive health care legislation drafted and passed. The speech Perry quoted was one salvo. Obama hit the same notes in a letter sent to the Senate Democratic leaders after that meeting and in his June 5, 2009, weekly radio/Internet address. In each, Obama called the health-care system "broken" and specified that rising health care costs were the problem, citing Medicaid as a factor in the letter but not in the speech. Obama’s letter said, "Soaring health care costs make our current course unsustainable" and "the ever-increasing cost of Medicare and Medicaid are among the main drivers of enormous budget deficits." In the radio address, he did not name Medicaid or Medicare but said, "We will seize this historic opportunity to finally fix what ails our broken health-care system" by attacking "the root causes of skyrocketing health care costs." White House spokeswoman Joanna Rosholm declined to comment on Perry’s claim. We asked Havens for his thoughts on Obama’s references to the health-care system (not just Medicaid) as broken. Havens replied by email: "No matter how you want to look at it, the president specifically referred to Medicaid when he was talking about a broken system that doesn’t work." Our ruling Perry said that Obama called Medicaid "broken." In context, it’s clear the president was including Medicaid as a significant part of the entire health care system and that his larger point was that health care costs need to be reined in. Still, Obama described expanding the Medicare and Medicaid rolls as putting "more people in a broken system." We rate the governor’s statement as Mostly True.

pomt-14669	Says Bernie Sanders "voted for what we call the 'Charleston Loophole.'"	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/jan/17/hillary-clinton/fact-checking-hillary-clintons-claim-bernie-sander/	Trying to highlight an area where she is to the left of her opponent, Hillary Clinton attacked Bernie Sanders for his position on guns during the NBC-YouTube Democratic debate in Charleston, S.C. Guns are a particularly emotional topic in South Carolina after Dylann Roof was accused of killing nine African-Americans in a Charleston church in June. Sanders, a senator from Vermont, defended his record on guns saying that he "supported from day one an instant background check to make certain that people who should not have guns do not have guns." Clinton fired back at Sanders with a list of his votes on gun bills, including this one: "He voted for what we call the ‘Charleston loophole.’ " We wanted to know what Clinton meant by the "Charleston loophole" and if Sanders voted for it. Brady bill Clinton and some advocates for tighter gun laws argued Roof was abetted by the three-day time limit for background checks for gun purchases, dubbing it the "Charleston loophole." Supporters of gun rights say blame actually goes to the FBI and its botched paperwork. Under current federal law, the FBI performs background checks on would-be gun buyers in South Carolina and 29 other states through its National Instant Criminal Background Check System. (The rest of the states do their own background checks.) If the check isn’t denied or completed in three days, the gun seller can proceed with the sale. Roof was able to get a gun as a result of clerical errors. Roof tried to buy a handgun in West Columbia, S.C., on April 11. An FBI examiner found that Roof had been arrested for a drug charge March 1. Because the records didn’t show a conviction, the examiner couldn’t deny the purchase but continued to look into Roof’s criminal history. Roof’s rap sheet mistakenly listed the neighboring county’s sheriff office as the agency that arrested him, leading the FBI examiner to request more information from the wrong offices. When the three days were up, the case was still listed as "pending" and Roof was able to purchase the gun. Two months later, Roof allegedly shot and killed nine worshippers and injured one in a historically black church in Charleston. He faces trial on murder charges later this year. Those three days were at the heart of the the Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act, which passed in 1993. A word about waiting periods: The Brady Bill didn’t contain a waiting period that required purchasers to wait to receive their firearm. (Some advocates like this idea, because they believe it might prevent impulsive acts of gun violence.) Rather, the bill set a time limit -- sometimes called a default to proceed -- for the government to conduct its background checks. Sanders, then in the U.S. House of Representatives, voted against the Brady Bill five times -- including a version that reinstated a five-day time limit for background checks. In November 1993, Sanders voted for an amendment imposing an instant background check instead. The problem was technology for instant checks didn’t exist at the time. As a result, according to the Washington Post Fact-Checker, supporters of the Brady bill were forced to negotiate a compromise. What first was proposed as 10 days for the government to conduct the check ultimately was whittled to three days. The final compromise version of the Brady bill was passed and signed into law on Nov. 30, 1993. It prohibited the transfer of a gun to an unlicensed individual, unless three business days have lapsed and the system has not notified the transferor that it would violate the law. Sanders voted against the final bill. Sanders’ campaign manager Jeff Weaver told us in July that Sanders voted against the bill because he believed a national waiting period was a federal overreach and because he was answering to his constituents. (We did not get a response from the Sanders’ campaign on debate night about Clinton’s attack.) So to recap: Sanders supported shortening the time the government had to conduct background checks. Whether extra time would have kept Roof from purchasing a gun is unclear. Our ruling Clinton said that Sanders "voted for what we call the Charleston loophole." In 2015, Roof was able to buy a gun after time ran out for the government to perform a background check -- the result of a clerical error when the FBI sought records from the wrong local law enforcement agency about Roof. Whether more time would have made a difference remains unknown. But Roof was able to purchase the gun after a three-day waiting period expired. Sanders voted in 1993 to shorten the time window for the government to conduct its check. Roof was able to purchase a gun after waiting out a three-day time limit on background checks. We rate this claim Mostly True. Clarification: This fact-check was edited on Jan. 19 to clarify waiting periods and and time limits on background checks.

pomt-06551	"My home state since June of 2009 created 40 percent of the new jobs in America."	mostly true	/georgia/statements/2011/oct/04/rick-perry/perry-right-texas-job-growth/	Republican presidential frontrunner Rick Perry visited the Atlanta area Friday to talk to a group about what his state has done to help businesses flourish. The Texas governor proudly did so amid some verbal shots at President Barack Obama and Republican rival Mitt Romney. Perry made a Texas-size claim about job growth in his state during his 12-minute speech at the Cobb Energy Performing Arts Centre. "My home state since June of 2009 created 40 percent of the new jobs in America," Perry told the Georgia Public Policy Foundation, an organization that researches and advocates for fiscally conservative ideas to promote the Peach State’s economic growth. June 2009 is when economists believe the "Great Recession" ended. Was Perry right? We wanted to find out. Perry has based his candidacy -- in part -- on all the people working in Texas, saying policies like the state’s lack of an income tax and his efforts to get out of the way of businesses are part of the reason for the job growth. In June 2009, there were nearly 10.3 million Texans on payrolls, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. In August 2011, the most recent federal data available, slightly more than 10.6 million people were working in Texas. The increase was about 323,000 jobs. Nationally, the number of additional Americans working increased by nearly 837,000 during that same time span. If you do the math, Texas accounts for 38.6 percent of that increase. Perry’s camp calculates the increase at 39.2 percent. It came up with the same amount of new workers in Texas but said the job increase was 824,000. Either way you slice it, the percentage of additional workers in Texas in comparison to the rest of the nation is impressive. So what’s going on in Texas? Some economic experts say Texas has some natural advantages, such as its oil, its ports and its proximity to Mexico. Thomas Saving, the director of Texas A&M University’s Private Enterprise Research Center, noted several other factors -- such as it being a right-to-work state and having low debt -- that draw businesses to the state. Saving, who teaches at Perry’s alma mater, said much of the job growth is in education and health care. The state’s population is growing, which means it needs more teachers. Texas, he said, has more people on the Medicaid rolls because of that population growth, which requires more health care professionals. Saving noted that the governor’s office in Texas does not have as much power as other states, so Perry should not get all the credit for the job growth. He also noted the simple factor of the additional people moving into the Lone Star State is another explanation for the job growth. That state’s population grew by nearly 4.3 million people between 2000 and 2010, more than any other state, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. California was second, with a population increase of about 3.4 million. Texas is now third in U.S. population, behind California and New York. Economist Doug Hall also pointed out the state’s population growth and its unemployment rate, which has risen from 7.7 percent in June 2009 to its current rate of 8.5 percent. "That’s a pretty significant number that [Perry] doesn’t mention," said Hall, director of the Economic Analysis & Research Network for the Washington-based Economic Policy Institute. Our friends at PolitiFact Texas tackled a similar topic when Perry boasted about the state’s job creation during a GOP presidential debate. It noted that moderator Brian Williams pointed out that Texas has the highest-in-the-nation share of minimum-wage workers. Perry’s numbers are on target, but there is some context to consider here. Some of the growth may be attributable to Texas’ regulations, but there are other factors, such as the state’s major population growth and the large number of minimum-wage workers.

pomt-00627	"For our next two years in my state, we will end with a structural surplus of $499 million."	mostly true	/wisconsin/statements/2015/may/26/scott-walker/scott-walker-says-499-million-surplus-ahead/	The education funding cuts in Gov. Scott Walker’s proposed 2015-’17 budget rankled critics because at one point a nearly $1 billion surplus was projected for the start of that budget. Walker and fellow Republicans returned much of the surplus to taxpayers in 2014, and then slower-than-predicted growth in tax collections further boxed in the GOP entering the new budget cycle. Now, while campaigning for president, Walker eagerly touts his budget as fiscally responsible. He is even using the "S" word again -- surplus. "At the end of the budget we're debating right now for our next two years in my state, we will end with a structural surplus of $499 million -- nearly a half-a-billion dollars on the structural side of things," Walker said in a May 9, 2015 speech at the South Carolina Freedom Summit in Greenville. Wait, his budget cuts education but it ends up in a surplus? All the claims and counterclaims about deficits and surpluses can get confusing. Let’s look more closely at this one. First, note the modifier "structural" in front of "surplus." That’s important. Walker is talking about a particular measure of a budget’s fiscal responsibility, one published regularly by the nonpartisan Legislative Fiscal Bureau. It’s usually called the "structural deficit" or "structural surplus," but even that name is misleading. The measure is not a prediction of whether the next budget will be in balance. By law it has to be. Rather, it is a tally of the size of the budget challenge lawmakers will face in the following budget (2017-’19) based on the spending and taxing decisions they are making in the upcoming one. Think of it as a rough projection of the amount of tax-collection growth the Legislature and governor will need to balance that 2017-’19 budget. It’s rough because the Fiscal Bureau doesn’t try to guess how much tax collections might rise or fall, or factor in demand for Medicaid health programs. But it gives lawmakers an idea of how decisions they are making might affect state finances going forward. The Fiscal Bureau examined Walker’s 2015-’17 budget plan and said it would create a positive balance of $300 million in year one of that 2017-19 budget and another $199 million in year two. This is the report that Walker spokeswoman Laurel Patrick cited to back up his claim. That adds up to $499 million, as Walker said. His own budget document published a similar number. Behind the numbers Much of the "structural surplus" traces to Walker’s proposed cut in aid for local school districts and to timing factors in the way Walker funds school tax credits, said Dale Knapp, research director at the Wisconsin Taxpayers Alliance. "You generally run into structural problems when, in the second year of the budget, spending is greater than ongoing revenues," Knapp said. "That is not the case in the governor’s proposal." Another expert agreed with the numbers, but found fault with how Walker phrased the deficit number as a done deal, when it’s not through the Legislature yet. "He assumes that the budget will pass exactly as he proposed it, and we all know that won’t happen," said Jon Peacock, head of the Wisconsin Council on Children and Families’ Wisconsin Budget Project. "Even the governor has been urging changes to the budget." That’s a fair point; the budget is still in the sausage-making stage. Peacock raised a larger criticism of using the structural imbalance number as a measure of the state’s fiscal condition. Lawmakers and governors have learned how to game a once-useful tool, he said. For instance, Peacock said, Walker’s budget unrealistically assumes a popular form of school aids will disappear in the following two-year budget. Knapp, too, called the school aid change "a bit of an accounting trick" that seems designed only to inflate the size of the structural surplus. Our rating Walker said a sign of his restoring fiscal responsibility was that "For our next two years in my state, we will end with a structural surplus of $499 million." A reliable, independent source made that estimate, so the figure is solid. Walker, though, makes it sound like a done deal when the budget is still undergoing legislative review. We rate his claim Mostly True.	None	Scott Walker	None	None	None	2015-05-26T05:00:00	2015-05-09	['None']
pomt-10594	"I was pretty proud of being the only guy on the stage that ever had a job in the private sector."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/jan/25/mitt-romney/he-should-check-their-resumes/	Mitt Romney likes to trumpet his experience in the private sector. He was the head of the 2002 Winter Olympics and founder of Bain Capital, a venture capital and investment firm. During a campaign rally in Pensacola on Jan. 25, 2008, the day after a Republican debate, Romney boasted, "I was pretty proud of being the only guy on the stage that ever had a job in the private sector." He needs to check the resumes of his rivals. Three of the four other candidates on the stage with Romney at the Boca Raton debate have private sector experience. Rep. Ron Paul was an obstetrician from 1968 to 1996 and has delivered more than 4,000 babies. That sounds like the private sector to us. Mike Huckabee has held several private sector jobs. He was a minister at Immanuel Baptist Church in Pine Bluff, Ark., the producer of radio and TV ads and a founder of KBSC-TV, a Christian TV station in Texarkana, Ark., now known as KLFI-TV. He served as the station's president from 1987 through 1992. He hosted a show called Positive Alternatives and, during his tenure, the station started airing Texarkana football. Rudy Giuliani has spent much of his career in public service, but he practiced law with the firm of Patterson, Belknap, Webb and Tyler from 1977 to 1981. When he stepped down from being mayor of New York in 2002, he founded Giuliani Partners, a consulting firm in emergency preparedness, public safety, crisis management, energy and health care. In 2005, he became a partner in Bracewell & Giuliani, a large law firm. When we inquired with a spokeswoman for the Romney campaign about the remark, she said Romney was referring to business experience. But we find plenty of the private-sector experience of the other candidates to be in business – especially Giuliani's work for the consulting firm, Huckabee's work at the Christian TV station and Paul's work running a medical practice. And so we find Romney's statement to be False. (For a PolitiFact chart summarizing the candidates' experience, click here.)	None	Mitt Romney	None	None	None	2008-01-25T00:00:00	2008-01-25	['None']
pomt-10750	"The Alternative Minimum Tax...was created by Congress in 1969 to affect 155 wealthy Americans. Because it was never indexed for inflation, those original 155 taxpayers has increased to affect about 3.5-million in 2006."	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2007/nov/01/rudy-giuliani/adding-up-the-amt/	On Jan. 17, 1969, Treasury Secretary Joseph W. Barr told Congress that 155 taxpayers making $200,000 or more did not pay any taxes on their 1966 income. That shook lawmakers into creating the alternative minimum tax in the Tax Reform Act of 1969. It was created as separate income tax system to ensure people did not use loopholes to avoid paying any taxes at all. Because of the law, people who are able to use deductions and legal shelters to lower their tax bill too much must pay a minimum income tax, the AMT. Under the law, taxpayers who meet the AMT threshold must pay the higher tax bill, whether it's their actual bill or the AMT. The trouble is that, unlike the standard income tax system, the AMT is not indexed for inflation. So as time moved on, growing numbers of people have fallen into the AMT program and, as a result, are paying higher taxes. In 2006, 3.5-million taxpayers fell under the AMT, which equates to about 4 percent of American taxpayers, according to the Congressional Research Service. But that was with a special limit — "a patch" — imposed by Congress. So, Giuliani has it right. All of it.

pomt-07698	Texas "ranks third in teen pregnancies... and it is No. 1 in repeat teen pregnancies."	mostly true	/texas/statements/2011/mar/07/gail-collins/new-york-times-columnist-gail-collins-say-texas-ra/	New York Times columnist Gail Collins isn’t on board with cutting education spending to balance the budget in Texas, one of the fastest-growing states in the land. "Nobody wants to see underperforming, overcrowded schools being deprived of more resources anywhere. But when it happens in Texas, it’s a national crisis," Collins writes in her Feb. 16 column. The column continues: "The birth rate there is the highest in the country... Texas ranks third in teen pregnancies — always the children most likely to be in need of extra help. And it is No. 1 in repeat teen pregnancies." We wondered if Collins pegged how the state ranks. Responding to our request for backup information, Collins pointed us to data from the National Campaign to Prevent Teen and Unplanned Pregnancy, a nonprofit that produces statistics and other information frequently used by teen pregnancy prevention groups. Citing the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the campaign reported in December that Texas had the third-highest teen birth rate among girls age 15-19 in 2008, behind Mississippi and New Mexico. Collins also cited Susan Tortolero, director of the University of Texas Prevention Research Center in Houston whom Collins quotes in her column, as a source. In an interview, Tortolero told us that Collins referred to pregnancy rates when it would have been more accurate to cite birth rates. Texas has the fourth-highest teen pregnancy rate nationally, Tortolero said, but the third-highest teen birth rate. "We’re No. 1 in teen repeat births, not pregnancies," she said. Next, we sought teen pregnancy data from the Washington- and New York-based Guttmacher Institute, which studies and advocates on issues related to reproductive health. In 2005, the most recent year for which there’s state-level data, Texas had the fourth-highest teen pregnancy rate among women ages 15-19, an institute report says. States with higher rates were Arizona, Nevada and New Mexico, which led the nation with 93 pregnancies for every 1,000 teenage women. States with large teenage populations also had high numbers of teen pregnancies, according to the report. California reported the highest number of teen pregnancies in 2005 (96,490), followed by Texas, New York, Florida and Illinois (30,000-70,000 each). Teen pregnancy rates declined in every state from 1988 through 2000, according to the report, and in every state save North Dakota from 2000 through 2005. Institute spokeswoman Rebecca Wind told us that according to institute studies on teen sexual behavior, improved contraception use accounted for approximately three-quarters of the decline in teen pregnancies. Over the past couple decades, Texas has been among the 10 states with the highest teen pregnancy rates. In 1988, it had the 10th highest rate, according to the report. It had the eighth highest rate in 1992, second highest in 1996, and fourth highest in 2000. Rochelle Tafolla, a spokeswoman at Planned Parenthood of Houston and Southeast Texas, told us she didn’t know of a repeat teen pregnancy study — "pregnancy is a harder data point to track," she said. But according to September 2009 data by Child Trends, a nonprofit Washington-based research group, Texas led the nation in the percentage of all births to mother under age 20 that are repeat births in 2006. When we asked Collins whether she confused birth rates and pregnancies in her column, she said: "You’re right." Summing up? Collins incorrectly referred to Texas’ teen birth rate as a pregnancy rate — Texas actually ranks fourth in teen pregnancies, not third. We couldn’t find data for repeat teen pregnancies, but Texas leads the nation in repeat teen births. We rate her statement as Mostly True.

At least fake news sites seem to. Don’t be fooled, though. A story that Malia Obama was fired from an internship at the U.S. embassy to Spain is fake news. A June 29, 2017, post on FreedomCrossroads.us says that the eldest daughter of former President Barack Obama was caught smoking marijuana during her internship at the Spanish embassy and sent home. "She was caught, by Embassy Security — aka the U.S. Marines — on the roof of the building burning a doobie and playing with the Ambassador’s carrier pigeons," the story said. "Ambassador Bedard is an avid hobbyist." Obama did intern at the embassy, in 2016, not this year. And there were no reports of her dismissal. This summer, Obama traveled with her family to Bali and Jakarta and is continuing an internship at the Weinstein Company movie studio she began in the spring. She is still expected to go to Harvard in the fall — which the post also denied. "She won’t be starting Harvard this fall and she has no future in government, since all government jobs require drug tests," the post said. The story said Malia Obama was caught by U.S. Marines, but that’s unrealistic. They are indeed stationed at embassies, but their primary role is that of protecting classified material in the interest of the United States’ national security — not watching over summer interns. The post also refers to the wrong ambassador. There has never been a U.S. ambassador to Spain by the name of Bedard, and there is actually no U.S. ambassador in Spain at all right now. Trump called for the resignation of foreign ambassadors nominated by Obama at the start of his tenure, and hasn’t replaced previous Spanish ambassador to Spain, James Costos, since. We don’t know whose carrier pigeons the story refers to, but there were no reports of pigeons during her internship last year, either. This isn’t the first time a fake news story about the former president’s eldest daughter has made its rounds on blogs and Facebook this year. Previous reports we’ve debunked said that Malia was expelled from Harvard before she even started and that she was arrested for drinking, drugs and dog-fighting. The latest story appeared on FreedomCrossroads.us, an unreliable site that as we have noted previously, has an About Us page that claims it "uses facts that don’t exist and relies more on imagination than the truth."

pomt-00689	The United States "is not modernizing its nuclear weapons."	false	/florida/statements/2015/may/05/marco-rubio/marco-rubio-says-united-states-not-modernizing-its/	U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., argues that the United States needs to do more to beef up its military to face down evil. Speaking at the Iowa Faith and Freedom summit on April 25, Rubio said that threats worldwide "require strong American leadership, which we cannot exert as long as we eviscerate military spending, which is what we are doing now. We are placing our nation at a dangerous position." Then he said this about the country’s nuclear stockpiles: "We are the only nation that is not modernizing its nuclear weapons." We wanted to know whether Rubio was correct that the United States isn’t modernizing its nuclear weapons, so we consulted with experts on U.S. nuclear policy. (We reached out to Rubio’s presidential campaign and Senate office and did not get a response.) Modernizing nuclear weapons Multiple experts told us that Rubio’s claim about nuclear weapons is wrong because ongoing and planned nuclear modernization efforts are extensive. The United States has been spending billions modernizing nuclear equipment -- and has plans to continue to do so. The National Nuclear Security Administration’s March 2015 report to Congress details plans to modernize nuclear equipment including various warheads over the coming years. A Congressional Research Service Report issued the same month covered similar topics. Modernization is happening for many different types of nuclear programs, said Matthew Bunn, an expert on nuclear proliferation and a professor Harvard University. (During the 1990s, Bunn was adviser to the White House’s Office of Science and Technology Policy.) "First, while we haven’t deployed major new strategic systems in some time, we’ve been modernizing the ones we’ve got more or less continuously — new rocket motors and guidance systems for the Minuteman missiles, lots of rebuilt parts for the B-52s, etc., etc. We’re in the middle of a $10 billion modernization of the B-61 bomb," Bunn said. These modernization plans are not cheap. The Congressional Budget Office estimated in January that the administration’s plans for nuclear forces would cost $348 billion over the next decade. During the next three decades, the cost to maintain the nuclear arsenal and purchase replacement systems could rise to more than $1 trillion, according to a 2014 report by the The James Martin Center for Nonproliferation Studies. The size of the U.S. stockpile has been declining since the 1960s and will decline further under the new START Treaty agreed to with Russia in 2011. But nuclear weapons can "live" for a long time. Several nuclear weapons introduced or upgraded in the 1990s or 2000s can be used for another 20 to 30 years, said Hans Kristensen, director of the Nuclear Information Project at the Federation of American Scientists. (Kristensen pointed to several upgrades in recent decades.) One analyst we spoke with had concerns that the upgrades aren’t happening fast enough. Tom Donnelly, a defense policy analyst at the conservative American Enterprise Institute, told PolitiFact that "we are not really modernizing our nukes very seriously" and that some projects are years -- even decades -- away and could could fall prey to budget cuts. But Benjamin Friedman, an expert at the libertarian Cato Institute, said that even if some modernization plans were canceled, "we would still be modernizing our nuclear arsenal or our nuclear weapons, just less of them. So any normal definition of ‘modernize,’ describes what the United States is doing with its nuclear weapons." Rubio compared the United States to the rest of the world without naming any other countries when he said "we are the only nation that is not modernizing its nuclear weapons." Rubio said that the United States was "the only nation" not modernizing its weapons, but Bunn, the Harvard professor, said comparing the United States on that basis with other countries is misleading. China, for example, is modernizing its arsenal, but its arsenal is also far smaller. The United States and Russia have over 90 percent of the world’s nuclear weapons, he said. "So I would say: (a) not true that we haven’t been modernizing at all; (b) IS (mostly) true that we haven’t bought any big new strategic delivery systems lately; (c) highly misleading not to mention that all nuclear powers other than ourselves and Russia have tiny nuclear arsenals compared to ours," Bunn said. Our ruling Rubio said that the United States "is not modernizing its nuclear weapons." Most of the experts we interviewed disputed Rubio’s statement. While the United States has reduced the number of warheads, it has also been modernizing nuclear equipment and has plans to continue to do so. We rate this claim False.

pomt-08484	Since the stimulus package was passed, "Ohio’s lost over 100,000 more jobs."	true	/ohio/statements/2010/oct/11/rob-portman/portman-uses-new-and-improved-number-job-losses-st/	PolitiFact has rapped Rob Portman for certain claims made during his U.S. Senate campaign. We’ve credited Portman, too, for truthful statements. That’s the nature of the Truth-O-Meter: We play it as it lays. Which brings us to Portman’s latest television ad. In the 30-second spot, Portman points to "out-of-control" federal spending, "dangerous" deficits and an economic stimulus plan that he says isn’t working. "Since the $800 billion stimulus passed, Ohio’s lost over 100,000 more jobs," Portman says in the commercial. The claim about the stimulus program not working has been batted about repeatedly. The White House said when the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act passed in February 2009, that unemployment would peak at 8 percent. Yet it is now 9.6 percent nationally, and 10.7 percent in Ohio. A number of economists say that even more jobs would have been lost were it not for the government spending to stimulate the economy. The Congressional Budget Office’s last quarterly evaluation said the stimulus increased national employment by 1.4 million to 3.3 million jobs. There have been mistakes, missteps and gaffes documented in the spending programs, however, and Portman and other Republicans say the spending was poorly focused. This central question will be for historians and economists in the future to settle. We’re merely taking note of Portman’s claim because of this: He uses a lower number -- 100,000 jobs lost in Ohio since the stimulus passed -- than he used previously. When he put the figure at 150,000 in June, the Truth-O-Meter ruled it Half True -- because only 127,900 jobs had actually been lost, judging by the most widely accepted measure. That was based on Bureau of Labor Statistics figures through May, the most current at the time. The numbers come from surveys of employers and are adjusted as the data becomes more complete. Using updated data, BLS now shows the post-stimulus job losses in Ohio came to 130,000 for the period Portman claimed in his earlier statement.. But now it’s October and Portman is using a lower figure when he speaks. As he said in his newest ad, and repeated during an Oct. 8 debate at the City Club of Cleveland, since the stimulus bill passed, "Ohio’s lost over 100,000 more jobs." Yet here’s the thing: Portman’s rhetoric might actually be too cautious now. As measured by the latest BLS figures, which go through August and are preliminary, Ohio has 149,200 fewer jobs now than when the stimulus passed. That’s exquisitely close to 150,000. What happened? The state steadily lost jobs through 2009 but the numbers started improving early in the year, continuing through May. The summer saw a retraction, however, reducing Ohio’s employment count by a total of 19,200 jobs during June, July and August. So Portman was accurate and then some with his recent, more cautious statement. The Half True ruling nevertheless stands for his June claim, because PolitiFact doesn’t believe in fortune-telling and Portman’s numbers were in fact off when he made that statement. But we give credit where credit is due. So the Truth-O-Meter takes a turn to the right and rules on Portman’s newest claim: True. Comment on this item.

pomt-15270	"House Republicans just passed a bill that makes it legal for single mothers to be fired by their employers."	false	/punditfact/statements/2015/jul/28/occupy-democrats/house-republicans-attacked-passing-bill-makes-it-l/	A meme shared by the liberal Facebook group Occupy Democrats calls out Republicans for an alarming affront to women. "House Republicans just passed a bill that makes it legal for single mothers to be fired by their employers," it says. The meme was shared more than 60,000 times, suggesting a lot of people found the news outrageous. We wanted to know if the meme is accurate: Did House Republicans really pass a bill that makes it legal for single moms to be fired by their employers? The outrage, we found, is overblown. No bill was passed It’s clear from a cached image of Occupy Democrats’ website and a Huffington Post article that the meme’s underlying beef is with the First Amendment Defense Act, HR 2802, introduced by Republicans on June 17. The bill, co-sponsored by U.S. Rep. Raúl Labrador, R-Idaho, and Sen. Mike Lee, R-Utah, is a conservative response to the Supreme Court’s decision to legalize gay marriage. Before we get into the bill’s language and possibly worrisome interpretations, we want to make one thing clear: This bill has not passed the GOP-led House. Far from it.The bill has been submitted to a committee for consideration. But it has not been debated, much less voted on, in committee or on the House floor. The Senate has also not moved on its companion. This, of course, doesn’t preclude either chamber from getting around to it. But to say the bill has been passed is just wrong. Only about 15 percent of bills make it past the committee stage, according to GovTrack.us. With that out of the way, we’ll explain why some advocates for women are concerned about its wording. What the bill actually says Some Americans saw the Supreme Court’s decision to legalize gay marriage as a potential affront to their religious beliefs under the First Amendment. The authors of the First Amendment Defense Act attempted to address how the court’s decision could affect religious institutions in a situation that came up during oral arguments. Justice Samuel Alito asked in April whether a religious school could lose its tax-exempt status if it opposes same-sex marriage, and the U.S. solicitor general, who was arguing for same-sex couples, said "it’s certainly going to be an issue." The First Amendment Defense Act mentions this exchange in its text and proposes that it should be illegal for the federal government to impose tax, grant or benefit sanctions on organizations that oppose same-sex marriage because of religious or moral convictions. The bill does not mention women at all. So where does the concern for single moms losing their jobs come into play? The part that worries some people is section 3(a), which reads: "Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the Federal Government shall not take any discriminatory action against a person wholly or partially on the basis that such person believes or acts in accordance with a religious belief of moral conviction that marriage is or should be recognized as the union of one man and one woman, or that sexual relations are properly reserved to such a marriage." Emily Martin, vice president and general counsel of the National Women's Law Center, pointed to the last part about sexual relations being reserved for the marriage of one man and one woman. The wording "can absolutely" be applied to women who are pregnant outside of marriage, she said. The introductory clause "notwithstanding any other provision of law," Martin said, seems to indicate that FADA would overrule other existing laws on this issue. Usually, when an individual feels she has been discriminated against, she has to file a complaint with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. The agency would then investigate the concern and give a ruling or provide the complainant with a "right to sue." However, Martin argued that, in an extreme scenario, it’s possible the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission would not have jurisdiction in cases under this bill since the First Amendment Defense Act specifically forbids the federal government from taking discriminatory actions against a person. (EEOC spokesman James Ryan said that the agency does not comment on pending legislation in Congress.) Samuel Estreicher, director of the Center for Labor and Employment Law at New York University’s Law School, says he would not read the bill as repealing Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (which protects against sex discrimination). Still, he said it could use some clarification. " ‘Acting in accordance with religious belief’ goes too far as a basis for protection," Estreicher said. "People can do bad things in accordance with their religious belief. … There needs to be better definition of the protected acts." PunditFact reached out to Occupy Democrats but did not hear back. What the bill’s sponsors say The bill’s primary sponsors in the Senate and the House say the bill is not supposed to target single mothers. This accusation resonates with Labrador personally because he was raised by a single mother. In a phone interview, Labrador said the First Amendment Defense Act deals exclusively with possible federal government actions against employers that do not support same-sex marriage. The federal government would not be able to use tax or other federal sanctions, such as withdrawing benefits or tax-exempt status, against employers who oppose same-sex marriage. Further, he said, the bill does not address employer-employee relationships, and if an employee felt that she was discriminated against, she would still be able to seek recourse through employment protections in Title VII of the Civil Rights Act or the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. That said, Labrador said he would make the bill more clear by defining which government actions would be considered discriminatory against institutions that oppose same-sex marriage. One part of the law (Clause 3(b)(5), to be specific) might be read as a catch-all for federal discrimination, so Labrador said he will take it out. "While (the possible firing of pregnant single mothers) was never an intended result of this legislation, we are taking these concerns seriously and working on tightening the language to ensure that the intent of the bill is clear," Labrador’s office said in a written statement. As of July 28, the bill had not been amended by the committee. Amendments can be introduced either by a committee or during debate in the House or Senate. Our ruling The Occupy Democrats’ meme said, "House Republicans just passed a bill that makes it legal for single mothers to be fired by their employers." There are big flaws with this claim: The bill in question has not been debated in the House or Senate, let alone passed under any definition of the word. It has merely been introduced. Further, the bill does not legalize the firing of single mothers. The bill deals with discriminatory actions that the federal government could take (such as tax sanctions) against religious institutions that oppose same-sex marriage. The meme scares Facebook users about an outrageous House Republican move that did not occur. So we rate the claim False.

pomt-14845	In Japan, "permanent residency is not given to Muslims," the "propagation of Islam" is banned, "one cannot import a Koran published in the Arabic language," and "Muslims cannot even rent a house."	pants on fire!	/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/nov/17/viral-image/viral-graphic-says-japan-keeps-out-radical-islam-t/	Amid rising concerns about terrorist attacks by ISIS, we’ve seen an uptick in chain emails and viral images about Islam. One viral image points to Japan as an example of a country that keeps out radical Islam by cracking down on all forms of Islam and its adherents, implying that this is a good model for the United States to follow. The graphic is a simple black-and-white block of text with the headline, "Japan keeps Islam at bay by putting restrictions on Islam and ALL Muslims." The graphic then mentions a variety of ways in which Japan supposedly keeps tight control over the Muslims in its midst: • "Japan is the only nation that does not give citizenship to Muslims" • "Permanent residency is not given to Muslims" • "Propagation of Islam in Japan is banned" • "In the University of Japan, Arabic or any Islamic language is not taught" • "Japan is the only country in the world with a negligible number of embassies in Islamic countries" • "One cannot import a ‘Koran’ published in the Arabic language" • "Muslims must follow Japanese law and language". • "The Japanese government is of the opinion that Muslims are fundamentalist, and unwilling to change their Muslim laws" • "Muslims cannot even rent a house in Japan" • "There is no sharia law in Japan" We wondered whether the graphic is accurate. To streamline our analysis, we focused mostly on these four claims -- that in Japan, "permanent residency is not given to Muslims," the "propagation of Islam" is banned, "one cannot import a Koran published in the Arabic language," and "Muslims cannot even rent a house." We heard back from three experts who have experience with the intersection of Japan and Islam, and all three said the graphic is blatantly incorrect. "The chain email is nothing but malicious falsehood," said Kumiko Yagi, a professor at the Tokyo University of Foreign Studies Graduate School who has written extensively about Islam and other religions. Kamada Shigeru, a professor of Islamic studies at the University of Tokyo, agreed, saying that all four of the claims we spotlighted are wrong. He said Japan doesn’t discriminate in permanent residency on the basis of religion and that "propagation" of Islam is not banned. He added that the Koran or other religious books in Arabic can be imported. As for renting a residence, he said there may be some reluctance among residents of Japan to rent apartments to foreigners as a general rule, but he said there’s no specific animus toward Muslims. These four claims "are totally unfounded," said Glenda S. Roberts, a professor of cultural anthropology and Japanese studies at the graduate school of Asia-Pacific Studies at Waseda University in Tokyo. "It is disturbing that such an email is circulating," she added. "These claims are simply ridiculous." Other claims in the graphic are easily debunked. For instance, the graphic claims that "Japan is the only country in the world with a negligible number of embassies in Islamic countries." Yet a quick visit to the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs’ website shows that Japan has embassies in such countries as Afghanistan, Bahrain, Iran, Iraq, Jordan, Kuwait, Lebanon, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Syria, Turkey, the United Arab Emirates and Yemen, plus a permanent representative to the Palestinian Authority. Meanwhile, there is nothing in Japanese nationality law that prevents Muslims from becoming naturalized citizens. The requirements concern length of residency, age, a history of "upright conduct," the ability to support oneself and a willingness to give up other nationalities. There is no mention of religion. As for universities not teaching Arabic, we found that the Tokyo University of Foreign Studies does. Classes in Arabic are also taught at the Arabic Islamic Institute in Tokyo. Last year, Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe made clear Japan’s respect for people of the Islamic faith during an event with the Islamic diplomatic corps. "I have found that a fundamental aspect of the spirit of Islam is harmony with and love for others," Abe said. "I believe therein lie points of commonality with the Japanese spirit, which is founded on co-existence." Our ruling The graphic says that in Japan, "permanent residency is not given to Muslims," the "propagation of Islam" is banned, "one cannot import a Koran published in the Arabic language," and "Muslims cannot even rent a house." Each of these four statements is incorrect, and the overall point of the graphic -- that Japan keeps itself free from radical Islam by discriminating against all Muslims -- is dramatically off-base.

pomt-10377	"More than half of all black children live in single-parent households, a number that has doubled — doubled — since we were children."	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/jun/23/barack-obama/statistics-dont-lie-in-this-case/	In a Father's Day address at the Apostolic Church of God in Chicago, Sen. Barack Obama chose a less than celebratory topic: the absence of men in the lives of many children, especially black children. "More than half of all black children live in single-parent households, a number that has doubled — doubled — since we were children." He went on to say that these absent fathers don't realize that "responsibility does not end at conception" and are "acting like boys instead of men." The New York Times noted that Obama sounded like comedian Bill Cosby, who has blamed fatherlessness in the black community, among other things, for African-Americans' overrepresentation in jail and underrepresentation among the educated. By using the term "we," we will assume Obama is speaking to people roughly his age, 46. And by that measure, his claim is backed up by data from the U.S. Census Bureau. In 1960, the year before Obama was born, 22 percent of black children lived with single parents. In 1968, the number rose to 31.4 percent. By 2006, the 1960 percentage had more than doubled to 56 percent. And the single parents are overwhelmingly women. In 2006, 91.4 percent of single parents of black children were mothers. That figure hasn't changed over the years. In 1960, it was a shade lower at 91 percent. The figures for single-parent families show a rosier picture among other races. About 28 percent of children of all races lived with a single parent in 2006. In 1960, only about 9 percent of American children lived with a single parent. The absence of fathers is important, Obama continued, because "children who grow up without a father are five times more likely to live in poverty and commit crime; nine times more likely to drop out of schools and 20 times more likely to end up in prison." Dr. Alvin Poussaint, a psychiatrist with Harvard Medical School and co-author with Bill Cosby of Come on People: On the Path from Victims to Victors, said Obama's view rings true: The absence of fathers corresponds with a host of social ills, including dropping out of school and serving time in jail. But he said other factors such as poverty, education level and the age of parents also correlate with single motherhood and adolescent problems. "I felt he was correct in calling attention to the fact that father involvement in children's lives is very important for their well-being and their healthy growth, and studies show that," Poussaint said. Rebecca Blank, a visiting fellow at the Brookings Institution who studies social and economic policy, wrote in an e-mail that it's difficult to pinpoint the exact causes of the social problems Obama mentions because they're so interrelated. But solid research has shown that growing up in a single-family household, even if other factors are controlled, has a negative effect. "I think there are very few social scientists these days who wouldn't agree that children in single-parent households are at risk of a variety of bad outcomes and that family structure has some causal impact on that risk," she wrote. Obama's premise that the absence of fathers is leading to social problems is backed up by research, but we're not ruling on that part of his statement. We're ruling on his claim that, "More than half of all black children live in single-parent households, a number that has doubled — doubled — since we were children," which U.S. Census numbers substantiate. And we rule it to be True.	None	Barack Obama	None	None	None	2008-06-23T00:00:00	2008-06-15	['None']

pomt-05029	"Mitt Romney's companies were pioneers in outsourcing U.S. jobs to low-wage countries."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/jul/13/barack-obama/were-romneys-companies-pioneers-outsourcing/	For Mitt Romney, a candidate who has made job creation the centerpiece of his campaign, it hardly helps to have news reports that Bain Capital invested in companies that moved jobs overseas. Based on that coverage, the Obama campaign produced a television ad that asserted "Mitt Romney's companies were pioneers in outsourcing U.S. jobs to low-wage countries." Our fellow fact-checkers at FactCheck.org and the Washington Post said similar claims from the Obama campaign were exaggerated. That prompted the Obama campaign to take the unusual step of pushing back with a long letter defending the claims. Subsequently, other news organizations have reported more on Romney’s time at Bain, which in turn led the Obama campaign to accuse Romney of not telling the truth about himself and the firm he once led. We decided to fact-check two parts of the Obama campaign’s statement. Were these really Romney’s companies? And were these companies actually "pioneers in outsourcing" ? Romney and his campaign have noted repeatedly that Romney left management of the company in 1999. That may be, but Romney was the company's founder, providing vision and direction for Bain. It's not as if his influence ended the moment he left to run the Olympics. Meanwhile, calling the companies "pioneers in outsourcing" overstates the case. They did promote outsourcing, but they were part of a trend already decades in the making. Romney's companies? Romney started Bain Capital in 1984. Its specialty was investing in new companies and helping them grow or taking troubled companies and turning them around. Romney likes to mention success stories like Staples, the office supply company. Some of these firms were deeply involved in outsourcing. The word "pioneers" comes directly from a June Washington Post article: "During the nearly 15 years that Romney was actively involved in running Bain, a private equity firm that he founded, it owned companies that were pioneers in the practice of shipping work from the United States to overseas call centers and factories making computer components." The Romney camp demanded a retraction on the grounds that some of the companies cited also created jobs in the United States. Others companies became part of the Bain portfolio after Romney took a leave of absence in February 1999, to run the 2002 Olympics in Salt Lake City. The Washington Post retracted nothing. As an example, let’s start by looking at a company that Bain did control under Romney’s watch: Modus Media. Modus Media specialized in helping companies like IBM and Dell Computers manufacture hardware overseas. As FactCheck.org confirmed, it was controlled by Bain. No one argues whether Modus Media created jobs in countries such as Singapore and China. Now, if those jobs never existed in the United States in the first place, it is difficult to argue that Modus Media or Bain sent them overseas. But in 2000, the firm unambiguously disrupted the lives of about 200 American workers when it announced it was closing a plant in Fremont, Calif. and opening one in Guadalajara, Mexico. The Romney campaign argues that prior to this, Modus Media had created about 700 domestic jobs. We don’t know the quality and pay of those jobs and how they would compare to the jobs that were lost. But we do agree that those new jobs should be part of the overall picture. The Romney campaign has also repeatedly asserted that the plant relocation didn’t happen during "Romney’s time." FactCheck.org emphasized that the move took place "more than a year after Romney had left Bain." This issue of when Romney stepped down and whether he can be held accountable for things that happened after February 1999 has become something of a cottage industry in the media. Talking Points Memo, Mother Jones, and the Boston Globe have unearthed SEC filings and personal financial disclosure statements that list Romney variously as CEO, Managing Director, and president of Bain as late as 2002. Bain released internal memos that seemed to show Romney played no role in management decisions. The Washington Post’s Fact Checker added another document that lends weight to the argument that Romney was not part of Bain management after 1999. It is a 2002 Massachusetts State Ballot Law Commission report certifying Romney’s eligibility to run for governor. It examined Romney’s activities when he took over the Olympics and based on weeks of testimony, the report revealed a man consumed with that task and who had no active connection to Bain. Looking at all the evidence made public so far, we do not think Romney was actively involved in the day-to-day management of Bain after 1999. But it doesn’t mean his influence disappeared after he left. Were they "pioneers"? Romney was the company’s founder, and we think it worth a broader look at Bain’s investment practices, starting in the early 1990s. "Typically, private equity companies tended to focus on companies in the $100 million to $500 million range," said Anant Sundaram, a researcher in mergers and acquisitions at the Dartmouth Tuck School of Business. More often than not, they turned them into companies worth $2.5 billion. Getting there was not easy. "Did the private equity firms have the incentive to do a lot of cost cutting?" Sundaram said. "You bet. Was outsourcing one of the ways of cutting those costs? You bet. Everybody was doing it." Our research shows that outsourcing was well established by the time Bain began buying shares in the companies described in the recent articles. To call these companies pioneers is a stretch. "This had been going on for decades," said Tim Sturgeon a researcher who focuses on outsourcing at the Industrial Performance Center at MIT. Outsourcing grew significantly starting in the early 1990s thanks in part to the expansion of the Internet and changes in the rules of international trade. Bain was one of scores of private equity firms that participated. "They were part of the herd," said Sturgeon. "To say they picked the pioneers gives (Bain) too much credit for being innovative. It was a mainstream strategy by that point." Every expert we contacted agreed that when Bain invested in the companies in question, it was counting on high returns that included the results of outsourcing. In that light, the exact month that Romney stepped away from Bain makes little difference. When Modus Media closed that plant in California in 2000, it was making the kind of move Romney and Bain expected when they first got behind it. The particular decision was not known, but the general nature of the decision was, the experts we spoke with said. Matthew Rice, Chief Investment Officer for DiMeo Schneider and Associates, a Chicago-based investment consulting firm, says he doesn’t see how Romney can divorce himself from the strategies that made Bain profitable. "Technically, I guess he can," Rice said. "But they would have done it anyway, whether he was there or not. If you can offshore and cut costs, you do it. Because if you don’t, the business might not survive and nobody would have any jobs." And Bain would not make any profits. And the sole purpose of any fund, private equity or otherwise, is to make a profit. Our ruling The Obama television ad holds Romney responsible for sending jobs outside the country. It said "Romney’s companies were pioneers in outsourcing U.S. jobs to low-wage countries." We find reasonable grounds for labeling the companies as "Romney’s." He was the founder of Bain and assembled a team that looked to make high returns. One strategy was to invest in companies that played off the trend in outsourcing. We make no judgment on whether outsourcing is good or bad. It was widely seen as profitable, and Bain selected companies that would succeed. If picking a company makes it yours, then these were Romney’s companies and in a general sense, they did what he expected them to do. The one caveat is there is a gray area of direct accountability, because no one has reported that he was personally involved in managing those firms. We find little evidence that the particular firms were "pioneers in outsourcing." The Obama campaign took the word from the Washington Post but used it as its own. Outsourcing was well established by the early 1990s, and firms were applying it in a variety of industrial areas. The Bain companies were among that group. The Obama campaign's statement would have voters believe that Romney played a key role in driving the outsourcing phenomenon. We find that an exaggeration. We rule the statement to be Half True.

pomt-10665	Says he has "the most impressive education record" of the Republican candidates.	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2007/dec/27/mike-huckabee/not-quite-the-best/	Standing on a stage in Iowa, amid all his competitors for the Republican presidential primary, former Arkansas governor Mike Huckabee made a bold claim. Of all the candidates, he said, he owned "the most impressive" education record. "We raised standards, we measured and we held people accountable for the results," he said. It might seem an easy thing to prove. He had 10 years of executive leadership under his belt, compared to Mitt Romney's four and Rudy Giuliani's eight. The others, of course, had none, leaving this a contest where only three could compete. Huckabee also had a pretty hefty resume behind him, including past chairmanships of the Education Commission of the States and the Southern Regional Education Board. And under his watch, he pushed for or signed legislation that improved Arkansas teacher pay, curriculum standards and education funding. The results were quite remarkable. As the Education Trust reports, Arkansas was the biggest gainer in fourth-grade math and second best in eighth-grade math over seven years of the national exam known as the "nation's report card." By the time of the debate, in fact, Huckabee had become the only Republican to be endorsed by the New Hampshire chapter of the National Education Association. But as is the case with all claims of being the best or worst of something, Huckabee's takes just a small amount of poking to find points that deflate the logic. First, consider Romney's record. Though in office a shorter time than Huckabee, Romney certainly can claim as strong, if not stronger, results. Massachusetts fourth- and eighth-graders rated first in the nation in both math and science on the "nation's report card" in both 2005 and 2007. Education Week rated Massachusetts as fifth on its 2007 "chance for success" index, compared to Arkansas' 39th. Second, consider Huckabee's critics, who say the former governor claims too much credit. Tom Kimbrell, a former superintendent who now heads the Arkansas Association of Educational Administrators, minces no words in assessing Huckabee's tenure: "He was the governor of Arkansas, but as far as being part of the process, he was not present. There was no leadership at all." Kimbrell, who was knee-deep in many of the state's education issues during Huckabee's tenure, said the Legislature and the state's education organizations made things happen on most key issues. And when Huckabee did press his views, such as on arts education and consolidation of small school districts, Kimbrell contended the results were not positive. Consolidation did not save money as promised, though it did disrupt many small rural communities. And a mandate for arts education came without funding and ended up as part of a lawsuit. Gary Ritter, an associate professor of education and public policy at the University of Arkansas, put it this way: "He took unpopular stands in favor of strategies he believed would work. I'm not sure if they worked." Did Huckabee act on education issues? Yes. Was his record the "most impressive" of the bunch? Romney certainly competes. So we rate Huckabee's boast Half True.

pomt-11388	Says David Hogg wasn’t at school during the Parkland school shooting.	pants on fire!	/florida/statements/2018/mar/27/blog-posting/david-hogg-not-school-during-shooting-s-fake-news/	Multiple internet bloggers falsely claimed that student David Hogg was not on the campus of Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School when the school shooting happened Feb. 14. The inaccurate claims surfaced after CBS News produced "39 Days," a documentary of several Stoneman Douglas High School students including Hogg. At the beginning of the video, Hogg, described as a student journalist, explained his immediate actions following the shooting that left 17 people dead. Some bloggers took the 14-second soundbite to insinuate that Hogg wasn’t actually at school when the shooting took place. "In a recently leaked excerpt of a CBS documentary, David Hogg admits he was at home during the Parkland shooting," reads the opening of a story on Squawker.org. See Figure 2 on PolitiFact.com "David Hogg admits he wasn’t at school during Parkland school shooting," says a headline on DailyPresser.com. None of those claims are true. The inaccurate posts say that Hogg’s comments directly contradict statements in a Feb. 15 Time Magazine interview. Hogg said he heard a gunshot while sitting in an AP environmental science class around 2:30 p.m. The blogs juxtaposed that statement with the following statement from Hogg in the CBS documentary: "On the day of the shooting, I got my camera and got on my bike and rode as fast as I could three miles from my house to the school to get as much video and to get as many interviews as I could because I knew that this could not be another mass shooting." People questioned how Hogg could be at school when the shooting started and also be riding his bike three miles to get his camera. And if Hogg really did leave school; how did he get back on to campus if the area was on lockdown? The timeline presented in this way is a bit confusing, but the blogs didn’t try to fairly settle the seeming discrepancy. Here’s what happened. Hogg was at the school during the shooting. Hogg shot a video on his cellphone while taking cover in a classroom closet. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com Sometime after that, he went home. At around 6 p.m., Hogg went back to get interviews, according to Vox. "The evening after the shooting, Hogg says, he biked up to the school, where the media was still camped out," the article says. "This time, he put himself in front of the camera, making his first — but not final — plea for an end to mass shootings." Regardless of this information, other conservative news websites including InfoWars and RedState jumped the gun and reported that the CBS interview "cast doubt" on Hogg’s whereabouts during the school shooting. Sometime after the original stories, both websites issued "updates" on their stories to say that the CBS video included Hogg’s quote without context. But not every site did. "It appears that the problem was that CBS included a very confusing quote without context," wrote conservative Florida writer Sarah Rumpf, author of the errant RedState story. "Hogg was on campus during the shooting and returned several hours later to interview people across the street." Claims that Hogg was not at school during the shooting are not based in reality.

pomt-08973	Some city of Atlanta employees "have not had raises in eight years."	false	/georgia/statements/2010/jul/18/charles-clark/union-leader-says-atlanta-hasnt-been-fair-some-emp/	We've all heard stories about employees who didn't get raises, but this claim from a union representative struck us. Charles Clark, executive director of the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees, Local 1644, said during the heat of debate among city of Atlanta leaders concerning whether to give only police officers raises that some employees had not received raises in eight years. "We think it is an insult to single out a group, without giving others a raise, when those others have not had raises in eight years," Clark said. Has it been that bad for some city employees? Well, we checked with the city of Atlanta's Human Resources Department. They keep personnel records of city employees and should know when was the last time they've received raises. According to their records, all city workers, except sworn police officers and firefighters, received a 2.6 percent cost-of-living increase on July 1, 2007. Those workers then received an additional 1 percent cost-of-living increase on New Year's Day 2008, HR officials said. Sworn police officers and firefighters received a 2 percent cost-of-living increase Jan. 1, 2008, the HR Department reported. Sworn police officers and firefighters received a performance-based salary increase of 3.5 percent in June 2008, a city HR official said. Gina Pagnotta, a Public Works Department employee who leads a 300-member association of Atlanta employees, agrees that city workers have received raises in the past eight years, although she's fuzzy on the details. "They did not get a substantial raise. They did get a cost-of-living increase," said Pagnotta, president of the Professional Association of City Employees. "Not having any raises in eight years, that is not correct." Employee pay was a big issue at City Hall in recent months when Atlanta's new mayor, Kasim Reed, said he wanted to give police officers -- and only them -- salary increases. One of Reed's biggest campaign promises was to improve public safety. He has vowed to hire more police officers as mayor and make sure they are better paid. Several City Council members initially opposed the pay hikes, saying to exclude other city workers would hurt employee morale. Last month, the council approved Reed's proposal concerning police officers and boosted their salaries by 3.5 percent. The council gave a similar salary increase to firefighters and a $450 bonus to city workers making less than $75,000. Reed said he supported the moves. Clark said he was initially told the workers had not received any raises in that time period. He said the cost-of-living adjustments are negligible if you consider that health insurance costs for Atlanta workers have risen in each of the past five years. "If one wanted to get technical about it, one would say [the city is] correct," Clark told PolitiFact Georgia. "But a deeper look would reveal that the cost to employees rose. The money went to offset the increase in insurance, so they did not receive any net gain." We followed up with the Human Resources Department to see if there was any merit to Clark's claim. Atlanta, like most local governments, uses a 12-month budget cycle (fiscal year) that begins July 1 and ends June 30. The city used two health care providers (Kaiser and Blue Cross and Blue Shield) in July 2007, when the cost-of-living adjustments took effect. On July 1, the health care rates rose for all city workers. Atlanta workers with families that used Kaiser paid an additional $904.20 during that 12-month period, a review of city records show. Workers using Blue Cross and Blue Shield paid an additional $1,003.20, the records show. The increases for workers without families were one-third of that total, regardless of which insurance provider they used, the review showed. The average salary for an Atlanta employee is about $47,000, according to city Human Resources officials. Since the average city worker makes $47,000 a year, we multiplied that number times the 2.6 percent cost-of-living adjustment and the additional 1 percent cost-of-living increase they received on Jan. 1, 2008. That worker's annual salary became $48,704, a $1,704 increase. The $1,704 is more than the increase in health care costs for a city worker with a family by at least $700. OK, but some Atlanta workers make much less. An employee with the salary of $30,000 watched his or her pay rise by about $1,100. That's still about $100 more than the health care increase if the employee had a family. Health insurance rates rose again in July 2008, 2009 and 2010. Clark is correct that those increases eclipse the cost-of-living increases given to most city workers in July 2007 and January 2008. However, his initial claim was that some city workers "have not had raises in eight years." Clark, who took the job about 3 1/2 months ago, said some city workers told him they hadn't received raises in eight years. In a subsequent interview with PolitiFact Georgia, Clark said the workers may have been comparing the 2.6 percent cost-of-living increase to what he said had been 3.5 percent salary increases in prior years. "It's a teachable moment," Clark told PolitiFact Georgia. "I stand clarified or corrected." PolitiFact Georgia appreciates his candor, but sorry, Charlie, we still find the claim is False.

pomt-09342	Says she introduced a ban on "dirty dancing."	mostly true	/florida/statements/2010/apr/09/frederica-wilson/wilson-banned-dirty-dancing/	State Sen. Frederica Wilson, a Miami Gardens Democrat running for the congressional seat now held by Kendrick Meek, is making an unusual boast about her accomplishments as a school board member: She says she introduced a ban on "dirty dancing." Here is what she says on her campaign Web site: "As a member of the Miami-Dade County School Board, Senator Wilson introduced reading labs and an African-American history curriculum into our schools, as well as a dirty-dancing ban in our community." She reiterated that claim in a March 9, 2009 press release announcing her campaign and on her Facebook page -- so there's no doubt she's against kids engaging in nasty booty moves. Pelvic thrusts aren't usually mentioned in congressional campaigns, so we jumped at the chance to explore whether she truly had introduced a ban. First, some background on dirty dancing. To many, the phrase conjurs up memories of the 1987 movie starring Patrick Swayze and Jennifer Grey. Remember the story? Grey plays a good girl nicknamed "Baby" who is on a family vacation at a Catskills resort. She stumbles upon a room where the working-class crew -- including Johnny, a beer-swigging-shirt-unbuttoned dance instructor played by Swayze -- are grinding their scantily clad bodies wrapped around each other in Do You Love Me. Johnny teaches Baby to dance -- among other, ahem, lessons -- and they fall in love. She learns some choreographed dance moves that are more of the gaze-into-each-other's-eyes variety than the make-your-grandma-blush type. In one famous scene, he lifts her by her hips as she is dripping wet in a lake. A decade later, the Miami-Dade school board took up the topic. There was no mention of the movie in the articles we found about the mid 1990s discussions, but there was plenty of harrumphing about kids dancing in sexually suggestive ways. "I've seen it in little tiny elementary school children. I couldn't take it, " Wilson said in a Nov. 19, 1995, Miami Herald article which stated that she asked school administrators to hold a meeting on the topic. "I don't think it sets a good standard for our district. We cannot allow (the dancing kids) to degrade the school district or themselves." In a 1997 op-ed, school board member Wilson said she was considering introducing a ban. "It has been called 'dirty dancing,' but it's really nothing more than simulated sexual intercourse. Outrageously, too many folks involved with Dade County's public schools -- including teachers, administrators, and parents who ought to know better -- call it 'cheerleading,' 'marching,' or other types of school-sponsored student performance. Whatever it's called, it's vulgar and degrading. It has no place in our schools, on our playgrounds, or in our students' lives. So, imagine my disgust and dismay when I marched in Dade's Martin Luther King Day Parade earlier this year and saw Dade high school cheerleaders bumping and grinding their way down Martin Luther King Boulevard." In a July 1997 news article, she was quoted saying, "I've seen horrendous behavior. I saw a band member bend over and a female majorette come from behind and simulate actual intercourse. I almost passed out, but people in the stands were applauding." Rather than calling it a "dirty dancing ban," it was known as "Guideline 25B: Student dance performances and/or productions: Procedures for promoting and maintaining a safe learning environment." The board's explanation of the rule said that cheerleading, dance and band performances at events, performances or educational settings "are essential to the establishment and maintenance of an atmosphere that fosters cultural and artistic exchanges. However the board recognizes that certain modes of dance are inappropriate, unsuited for immature audiences and may offend the community's sense of propriety rather than foster appropriate conduct that is consistent with school board rules and state statutes." School board documents said the rule prohibited performances that depicted "actual or simulated sexual intercourse (normal or deviate), masturbation, excretory functions and actual lewd exhibition of genitalia." It's clear from news coverage and school board minutes that Wilson was the driving force behind the ban. School board minutes for the July 9, 1997, meeting state that Wilson proposed the rulemaking. The motion passed unanimously. On Aug. 27, 1997, the school board voted again in favor of the proposal. But there's still a bit of exaggeration in her statement: Wilson described this as a ban "in our community" when it strictly related to school-related groups or performances. She told us that was a reasonable description because "the dirty dancing ban was on school bands and majorettes in the community. We have a lot of parades -- the MLK parade, different half time shows at football games in the community. I witnessed it -- a lot of forward-thrusting of the pelvic bone." Clearly Wilson introduced the dirty dancing ban approved by the school board in 1997 and we don't doubt that school activities now have less forward-thrusting of the pelvic bone. But her claim that the ban would apply "in our community" is a little misleading. Some people might think her ban applied to the entire county, not just the schools. So we rate this claim Mostly True.	None	Frederica Wilson	None	None	None	2010-04-09T14:37:08	2010-04-09	['None']

pomt-09572	"We cut taxes for 95 percent of working families."	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/jan/28/barack-obama/tax-cut-95-percent-stimulus-made-it-so/	President Barack Obama talked a lot about economic recovery during his State of the Union address on Jan. 27, 2010, including the benefits of the economic stimulus bill passed last year. The stimulus, formally known as the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, included tax cuts for many Americans, Obama said. "We cut taxes. We cut taxes for 95 percent of working families. We cut taxes for small businesses," Obama said. "We cut taxes for first-time homebuyers. We cut taxes for parents trying to care for their children. We cut taxes for 8 million Americans paying for college." Democrats applauded, while Republicans were silent for the most part. In one of the unscripted moments of the night, Obama looked at the Republican side of the room, smiled and said, "I thought I'd get some applause on that one." Here, we wanted to check Obama's statement that he cut taxes for 95 percent of working families. The key word in his statement is "working." Obama's claim is based on a tax cut intended to offset payroll taxes. Under the stimulus bill, single workers got $400, and working couples got $800. The Internal Revenue Service issued new guidelines to reduce withholdings for income tax, so many workers saw a small increase in their checks in April 2009. The tax cut was part of Obama's campaign promises. During the campaign, Obama said he wanted $500 for each worker and $1,000 for working couples. Since the final number was a bit less than he promised, we rated his promise a Compromise on our Obameter, where we rate Obama's campaign promises for fulfillment. During the campaign, the independent Tax Policy Center researched how Obama's tax proposals would affect workers. It concluded 94.3 percent of workers would receive a tax cut under Obama's plan based on the tax credit to offset payroll taxes. According to the analysis, the people who wouldn't get a tax cut are those who make more than $250,000 for couples or $200,000 for a single person. Obama said he intended to raise taxes on those high earners, a promise he reiterated during the State of the Union, and that revenue would offset the stimulus tax cut. Because the stimulus act did give that broad-based tax cut to workers, we rate Obama's statement True.	None	Barack Obama	None	None	None	2010-01-28T00:02:13	2010-01-27	['None']

pomt-04198	Says real estate taxes were put in place to pay for Obamacare.	mostly false	/texas/statements/2012/dec/06/todd-hunter/todd-hunter-says-obamacare-funded-real-estate-taxe/	A South Texas legislator opposed to the federal health care overhaul signed into law by President Barack Obama doesn’t like how the law came to be. State Rep. Todd Hunter, R-Corpus Christi, was asked during a Nov. 26, 2012, Texas Tribune event what he favors in state health care reform. Hunter replied: "The first thing I prefer is transparency," adding that in his view, doctors, nurses and the people weren’t included in writing the federal act. "And when you have amendments where Nebraska gets exempted from the taxation and then today we’re finding out you have real estate taxes being placed to pay for this?" Hunter said. "Actually, the biggest problem is how it was handled," Hunter said. First, let’s weigh the Nebraska exception. By email, Hunter told us he was referring to the so-called "Cornhusker Kickback," which was a 2009 deal resulting in the Senate-approved version of the health care act giving Nebraska added federal Medicaid funds, as recapped by FactCheck.org in a December 2011 review. At the time the amendment was accepted, U.S. Sen. Ben Nelson, D-Nebraska, declared he would vote for the overall proposal. However, the Nebraska provision was removed before the legislation passed into law, FactCheck noted. In turn, "all states ended up with more federal funds, and they may well have Nelson to thank for it," FactCheck wrote. By phone, Hunter told us he had not said that the Nebraska amendment stuck in the plan because he didn’t know whether it did. He said he mentioned the amendment to demonstrate the deal-making that went on. In any event, his Nebraska reference could be taken as vague. So we’re focusing this fact-check on whether real estate taxes were put in place to fund Obamacare. Hunter pointed us to a Nov. 17, 2012, Forbes.com blog post by Michael Chamberlain, a personal financial planner. Headlined "Will You Pay the New Obamacare Tax," the post says a surtax in the law means couples with incomes over $250,000 a year and singles earning more than $200,000 could see their taxes increase in 2013. He also nudged us to an undated publication on the tax from the National Association of Realtors, which says in part that the "tax WILL NOT be imposed on all real estate transactions, a common misconception." Indeed. In February 2011, PolitiFact debunked a claim that under Obamacare, all real-estate transactions would be subject to a 3.8 percent sales tax. That statement, rated Pants on Fire, is deceptive because a Medicare tax on investment income created under the law applies to the investment income of single taxpayers who make more than $200,000 or couples who make more than $250,000. (It’s spelled out in Section 1402 of the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010, titled "Unearned income Medicare contribution.") That seems worth stressing. The tax would only apply to very high earners, accounting for no more than 2 percent of taxpayers, Roberton Williams, a senior fellow at the Washington-based Tax Policy Center, told us by telephone. For them, he noted, the tax would apply to the lesser of how much the taxpayer’s adjusted gross income exceeds the $200,000/$250,000 threshold or the amount that their investment gains exceeds the relevant threshold. And which investments might be subjected to the tax? According to the Internal Revenue Service, the Net Investment Income Tax applies, starting in 2013, to investment income for those very high earners from interest, dividends, capital gains, rental and royalty income and certain annuities plus income from businesses involved in trading financial instruments or commodities and businesses that are "passive activities to the taxpayer," meaning they're held for the purposes of gradual long-term appreciation. Williams said he calls the tax an investment tax. "When somebody says ‘real estate tax’ to me, I don’t think of the capital gains tax on real estate sales. I think of the property tax" levied by local and state governments. "This" new tax "has nothing to do with property taxes," Williams said. Separately, a director for the Washington-based Tax Foundation, which says it seeks sound tax policy, said the group does not call the tax a real estate tax. Joe Henchman said by phone: "I imagine calling it a real estate tax could scare a lot of people, unnecessarily. Everyone is going to think it applies to them when 99 times out of 100, it won’t." While few property owners would be affected in the tax’s early years, the foundation said in a Sept. 24, 2010, blog post that more home sellers could be hit as years pass because the tax changes were not indexed for inflation. PolitiFact has previously pointed out that homeowners will not be socked by the tax even if they make sales profits of hundreds of thousands of dollars. That’s because there’s a long-standing tax exemption on the profits from home sales. To be hit with the investment tax, you would have to clear more than $250,000 in profit off your home, which means at least $250,000 more than you paid for it. The ceiling is higher for a married couple. Married couples are not taxed on the first $500,000 of profit from home sales. And again, that's profit, not the sales price. Finally, we wondered how much total revenue the tax is expected to produce. Williams suggested we consider research by the Joint Committee on Taxation, which assists members of Congress on tax policy. The panel’s March 20, 2010, fiscal analysis of the health care law says that combined with a change in law stepping up payroll tax contributions by high-income taxpayers, the investment tax is expected to raise $210 billion from 2010 through 2019, a little under half of $438 billion in net revenue attributed to the overall law. Hunter later said he didn’t intend to scare anybody with his comment. "We do need to make sure folks know how complicated this deal is," Hunter said. Our ruling Hunter said real estate taxes were put in place to pay for Obamacare. That’s an incomplete characterization, potentially leaving the misimpression we’ll all be ponying up every time we sell a property. In reality, the tax helping to fund the health care law is an investment tax solely affecting the very wealthiest taxpayers and then only touched off by super-sized profits from any of a variety of investment types. Real estate (including rents) fits into the big mix, giving the claim an element of truth. We rate it as Mostly False.	None	Todd Hunter	None	None	None	2012-12-06T16:00:00	2012-11-26	['None']
pomt-02142	Says Rick Scott’s record on jobs includes Florida "ranked 2nd in the nation in long-term unemployment."	half-true	/florida/statements/2014/may/06/charlie-crist/charlie-crist-says-florida-no-2-long-term-unemploy/	In an April TV ad by Gov. Rick Scott’s political committee Let’s Get to Work, the narrator states: "Florida’s unemployment tripled. 800,000 jobs gone...." and reels off other bad news economic statistics. "Which governor took Florida to the bottom? Charlie Crist." Crist counter-attacked on his campaign website and argued that the unemployment picture isn’t as rosy as painted by his Republican opponent. "Floridians understand that Scott’s numbers never tell the whole truth. But, since he insists on talking about numbers, here are some of his own..." Crist then cites a series of unflattering economic numbers including this one: "Florida is ranked 2nd in the nation in long-term unemployment." We looked at the state’s ranking on long-term unemployment and found that there was some truth to Crist’s claim but that the data comes with some caveats -- particularly about Crist’s implication that Scott owns that ranking. Long-term unemployment Crist’s claim about the long-term unemployed linked to a February article in the Orlando Sentinel that cited analysis by the Economic Policy Institute, a liberal think tank. EPI calculated that 46.2 percent of laid-off Floridians were out of work for at least six months in 2013. Only New Jersey and Washington, D.C., were higher, at 46.6 percent. We interviewed David Cooper, the economic analyst at EPI, who wrote the post in January that included a state-by-state map showing long-term unemployment. Cooper said that he used the monthly data released by the U.S. Labor Department's Bureau of Labor Statistics to calculate the share of those unemployed 27 weeks or longer by state. The Current Population Survey, on which the BLS bases its data, is a sample representative for the nation. But when the data is used to drill down to the state level, the margin of error goes up significantly, Cooper said. And drill down even further to those who are long-term unemployed, and "again the margins of error go up even more." So while Cooper found Florida was in second or third (since New Jersey and D.C. were tied), the margin of error is large enough it could fall anywhere from the second to seventh place range, he said. "Florida is clearly near the top, (but) where it sits in order is kind of ambiguous," he said. We sent the EPI report to a few Florida economists. While they didn’t dispute EPI’s numbers, economists noted that there are other ways to measure long-term unemployment. "The figures provided by EPI are the percent of the unemployed that are long-term unemployed, not the percent of the labor force that are long-term unemployed," said Rollins College economist Bill Seyfried. So that will lead to different rankings, because one starts with the pool of unemployed, while the other looks at the entire labor force. Seyfried looked at long-term unemployed divided by size of labor force and determined that Florida came in 11th place in 2013. Florida’s unemployment rate declined considerably in 2013, which resulted in a relative improvement in the percent of the labor force that are long-term unemployed, Seyfried said. University of Florida economist David Denslow added some caveats to EPI’s data: Unemployment data is difficult to measure because people may not accurately report whether they are actively seeking work and how long they have been unemployed. Also, he said the sample size is small. "We don't know just where Florida ranks in those data, since the margins of error are too large," Denslow said. "But it is highly likely that Florida is one of the top 10." Blame on Scott? Crist’s statement could be interpreted as blaming Scott for the long-term unemployment figures. Economists we interviewed said that governors can take steps to influence employment, but there are other national economic trends at play that can’t be blamed (or credited) to any one particular politician. Just as Crist can’t be blamed for the nationwide economic crash as the housing bubble burst, Scott can’t be blamed for the state’s long-term unemployment figures as Florida recovers. Sean Snaith, director of the University of Central Florida's Institute for Economic Competitiveness, said, "It is a tough sell to push the blame for long term unemployment onto Gov. Scott, particularly since the problem clearly has its roots in the recession that occurred during Gov. Crist's term. Florida shed over 800,000 jobs during Gov. Crist's term and that amount of jobs cannot be recovered overnight. The long-term unemployment problem is more a function of the severity and nature of the recession experienced in Florida rather than any particular policy." Our ruling Crist said in a blog attacking Scott, "Florida is ranked 2nd in the nation in long-term unemployment." An analysis by the Economic Policy Institute ranked Florida second, with New Jersey and the District of Columbia ahead. But there is a significant margin of error to these numbers, and it’s difficult to pinpoint each state’s ranking. Other economists used other measures to come up with a different ranking for Florida. Also, while governors can play a role in developing jobs, the pace of Florida’s recovery can’t be pinned on Scott. We rate this claim Half True.

pomt-08250	"The Republican who was just elected governor of the great state of Florida paid his campaign staffers, not with money, but with American Express gift cards."	half-true	/florida/statements/2010/nov/12/rachel-maddow/rick-scott-pays-campaign-workers-gift-cards-not-ca/	Rick Scott poured $73 million of his own money into his successful campaign for governor. Yet he wouldn't even pay his campaign workers in cash, says MSNBC liberal commentator Rachel Maddow. On her Nov. 10, 2010, show, Maddow said Scott inexplicably paid his campaign workers in American Express gift cards. Maddow made the claim in a rhetorical game of true or false, which you can watch here. "The Republican who was just elected governor of the great state of Florida paid his campaign staffers, not with money, but with American Express gift cards for some reason. Is that true or false?" Maddow asked. "That is, ding, true. A young man named Mark Givens(sic), who said he found a job through the Rick Scott for governor campaign through a listing on Craigslist, has told local WTSP news station that he did not find out until after he had already worked for Rick Scott's campaign that Rick Scott's campaign would not pay him in, you know, money." We wanted to check Maddow's claim with our own Truth-O-Meter game -- True or Pants on Fire! (Or somewhere in between). Maddow said her source was WTSP, Tampa Bay's CBS affiliate, which ran a Nov. 8, 2010, report claiming that a Scott campaign worker named Mark Dongivin was paid in gift cards and not cash. Dongivin told the TV affiliate he worked on the Scott get-out-the-vote campaign off and on for about a month, walking neighborhoods and making phone calls. But when it was time to get paid, he was told there would be no checks. "We can't give you a check, we're gonna give you gift cards," Dongivin said his supervisor told him. Dongivin said he wasn't the only Scott campaign worker to be paid in gift cards and not a check or cash. The TV report went on to cite an unnamed spokesperson, something we won't do at PolitiFact Florida, who acknowledged some campaign workers were paid in gift cards, and that anyone who had a problem with the arrangement could return the cards for a check. That's the background. Now for the details. In the Republican primary, the Scott campaign used its own campaign account to pay for its staff. But after the primary, payroll responsibilities switched to the Republican Party of Florida. It's standard practice, in part because the party can receive larger campaign contributions than an individual candidate. Scott spokesman Brian Burgess directed us to the party to answer questions about how staffers were paid. They 'fessed up. "Like many other campaigns, gift cards were distributed to short-term Scott field staff almost exclusively for the final 72-hour field efforts," Republican Party of Florida spokesman Dan Conston said. "It's a simpler and quicker way of compensating short-term help." Conston said a Scott campaign representative and someone from the party would approve the spending, but did not say who. Neither Conston nor Burgess said how many temporary campaign workers were paid in gift cards. Full-time staffers were paid by check, Conston said. Two other notes from Conston: He said the gift cards were only used in the last week of the campaign, and that because of service fees, the campaign actually paid above face value. In Dongivin's case, he was a temporary worker hired to drive out voters on Election Day. Typically, it's a responsibility many people might associate with a volunteer -- and many campaigns use volunteers in the same way. Dongivin was paid $178 on Oct. 15, according to Republican Party of Florida campaign finance records. He also likely received a second payment on Oct. 31, 2010 -- though those records are not yet public. We reached out to more than 20 people across the state who worked with the Scott campaign to see how they were paid. Most didn't respond to our messages, but those that did say they were paid in checks, just like every other employee they knew. Michael Fluno worked out of the Tampa office of Scott's campaign until shortly after the primary and said he was always paid in checks. While Fluno was working on the campaign, he said, he "knows, for a fact, that no one was paid with any kind of gift card." Same goes for Dean Palecheck, of Orlando, who worked on the campaign during both the primary and general election. When asked how he was paid, Palecheck said: "Paid by check, like any normal employee there." What's interesting here is that it's not new for campaigns to use gift cards to pay part-time, temporary workers. In fact, President Barack Obama's campaign did the same thing in 2008. A TV station in Indianapolis reported that last-minute workers for Obama's 2008 campaign were paid $30 Visa gift cards for three-hour shifts of work. The temporary workers complained to the TV station that they were not being paid fairly. Which brings us back to Maddow. On her nationally televised cable program, the liberal commentator picked up on a local TV news report and claimed Scott "paid his campaign staffers, not with money, but with American Express gift cards." While she's right that Dongivin, and other temporary workers, were paid with gift cards and not cash, we think her comments are a bit misleading to the average viewer. First, we think many people might think Maddow was referring to all campaign workers, but traditional campaign staffers -- the people working day in and day out on the campaign -- were paid by check, like any normal job. A Republican Party official said it was simply an easier, more efficient and quicker way to pay people. And second, it's not that unusual. In 2008, Obama did the same thing. Playing it up in Scott's case takes it out of context, so we rate this claim Half True.

pomt-00583	If Fox News' presidential debate rules had been in place during the 1992 election, "Bill Clinton wouldn't have been on the stage."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/jun/07/rick-santorum/foxs-debate-rules-would-have-kept-bill-clinton-sta/	Republicans have a bumper crop of presidential candidates, and it has created a traffic problem for the television networks that help put on the debates. At last count, there are 10 confirmed contenders (Rick Perry, Lindsey Graham, George Pataki, Rick Santorum, Mike Huckabee, Ben Carson, Carly Fiorina, Marco Rubio, Rand Paul and Ted Cruz) with more possible on the way (Jeb Bush, Scott Walker, John Kasich, Chris Christie and Bobby Jindal). Fox News announced it would hold the first debate on Aug. 6 in Cleveland, but the cable network said it would invite only the top 10 declared candidates. The network’s ranking would be set according to "an average of the five most recent national polls" as of Aug. 4. Former Pennsylvania Sen. Rick Santorum, who won the Iowa caucuses in 2012, called the cut-off arbitrary. Appearing on Fox News, where he once was a contributor, Santorum dipped into history to show that early poll results are meaningless. "We should have the opportunity for everyone to be heard," he told Fox News Sunday host Chris Wallace on June 7, 2015. "You know, if you would have taken the top two-thirds of the folks in 1992, Bill Clinton wouldn't have been on the stage." Clinton obviously went on to win the White House, and Santorum’s concern is obvious. While Santorum won 11 primaries in 2012, today he ranks tied for 11th in the latest Fox News poll. That’s just outside Fox News’ debate cut-off -- though that can change depending on who officially declares and what later polls show. We decided to dig into the wayback machine of primary polls. We wanted to know what numbers Santorum had in mind and reached out to his communication staff but did not hear back. What we found suggests Santorum is right that Clinton started out in 1991, the year before the presidential election, with low polling numbers. But Santorum is making a comparison that doesn’t quite fit because of the huge difference in the 1992 primaries versus the one beginning now. Moreover, by the time the Democratic candidates did debate in 1991, Clinton was not doing as poorly in the polls as Santorum claims. The early polls FiveThirtyEight's Nate Silver accumulated and analyzed several cycles of presidential primary polls, including the cycle leading up to the 1992 election. Silver was able to find just three polls from January-June 1991, a period comparable to today. And the ones he found showed Clinton at the back of a crowded field -- with an average of just 1.7 percent. That was good enough for 13th out of 19 prospective candidates. In a hypothetical sense, a debate that included the top two-thirds of those candidates just barely might have excluded Clinton. The problem with such a hypothetical is that there were hardly any declared Democrats running for president by June 1991. One of the conditions for the Fox News debate is that only official, announced and registered candidates need apply. In mid 1991, the would-be frontrunner was New York Gov. Mario Cuomo. Cuomo ended up not running. And in fact, the top 9 candidates in early polls that year all declined to run, Silver found. Clinton himself didn’t announce his candidacy until October 1991. So a snapshot of June 1991 versus June 2015 is hardly useful. Neither is a comparison that focuses on an August 2015 debate. The earliest debates in the 1992 cycle we found were an NBC debate on Dec. 15, 1991, and one sponsored by PBS on Jan. 19, 1992. By then, the hypothetical field had been narrowed to actual candidates, and the polling was more favorable to Clinton. By the time of the first debates, there were five main Democratic candidates: Clinton, former California Gov. Jerry Brown, and Sens. Tom Harkin, Bob Kerrey and Paul Tsongas. A sixth candidate, Virginia Gov. Douglas Wilder, withdrew on Jan. 8, 1992. He participated in the Dec. 15 debate but not the one on Jan. 19. A search on LexisNexis provided us with a handful of polls for the men who were left standing: Poll Date Brown Clinton Harkin Kerrey Tsongas New York Times/CBS Oct. 22 12 5 3 7 2 Los Angeles Times Nov. 12 18 9 6 5 4 Los Angeles Times Nov. 27 20 9 4 5 4 USA Today/CNN/Gallup Jan. 14 21 17 9 11 6 Silver’s polling average from July to December 1991 shows a tight pack: Candidate Polling average Mario Cuomo 9.9 Douglas Wilder 9.7 Jerry Brown 14.9 Bill Clinton 8.3 Bob Kerrey 7.7 Tom Harkin 6.3 Paul Tsongas 4.1 The point here is that there never were more than 10 serious declared candidates, as might happen in 2015. And Clinton’s position was not as poor as Santorum made it seem. By the time of the first debate, Clinton would have passed muster by the Fox News standard as an announced candidate ranked among the top two-thirds of the pack. Our ruling Santorum said that if Fox News had applied its 2016 rules to a hypothetical Democratic primary debate in 1992, that Clinton would not have been on the stage. Santorum was trying to make the point that early presidential polls may not be the most useful yardstick to determine who gets into a debate and who doesn’t. In that regard, Clinton’s story from 1991 somewhat backs that up. Early presidential polls showed Clinton as a significant underdog. But in reality, Santorum errs in trying to make a comparison between the 1992 and 2016 presidential cycles. Most of the top Democrats Clinton trailed in those early polls never actually declared as candidates. Under the Fox News rules, none of them would qualify to participate in its debate. And by the time the field was set in late 1991, Clinton’s position in the polls suggested he was a viable candidate.

pomt-03890	The majority of public funding for the Marlins stadium "came from hotel taxes, the burden of which is incurred by tourists who are visiting our city, NOT the resident taxpayers."	half-true	/florida/statements/2013/mar/05/jeffrey-loria/marlins-owner-jeff-loria-says-tourists-not-taxpaye/	After a dismal 2012 season, Marlins baseball owner Jeffrey Loria slashed payroll and got rid of a handful of expensive players, including star shortstop Jose Reyes and pitcher Josh Johnson. Miami baseball fans cried "foul!" Loria’s moves revived debate about the lucrative public financing the Marlins won to build their stadium in 2009. On Feb. 24, Loria took out a full-page "letter to our fans" ad in the Miami Herald and other South Florida newspapers to defend his team’s deal, saying he wanted to review the "facts." Loria’s letter was full of claims about the team’s roster, finances and the stadium deal -- with some reminders about the 2003 World Series sprinkled in. Loria began with an admission that the Marlins’ performance on the field "stunk" and said he takes his share of the blame. But then Loria turned up the defense: "Those who have attacked us are entitled to their own opinions, but not their own facts. The majority of public funding came from hotel taxes, the burden of which is incurred by tourists who are visiting our city, NOT the resident taxpayers....." Sports writers and others have ripped apart Loria’s rant. (Yahoo! Sports rebutted Loria’s claims about everything from player trades to finances to the stadium’s design awards.) Here at PolitiFact, we decided to put part of Loria’s claims about the stadium’s public financing to the Truth-O-Meter: "The majority of public funding came from hotel taxes, the burden of which is incurred by tourists who are visiting our city, NOT the resident taxpayers." Loria’s claim suggests that it was largely tourists -- not Miami-Dade taxpayers -- who are footing the bill for a stadium project. Is it those high-rolling tourists who are mostly paying by plunking down credit cards at luxurious hotels in South Beach and beyond? Do resident taxpayers bear minimal financial burden here for the stadium? Marlins stadium deal We turned to Miami Herald articles, stadium agreement documents and county officials to explain the deal. After about a decade of failed attempts, the Marlins finally reached a deal in 2009 with Miami-Dade County and the city of Miami to replace the Orange Bowl stadium with a 37,000-seat retractable roof stadium in the Little Havana neighborhood of Miami. The stadium cost about $515 million. Add in the parking complex, and the total rises to more than $600 million. The county, the city and the Marlins themselves all contributed to a fairly complicated deal. Here’s a big-picture accounting of what each agreed to put in: Miami-Dade County: In March 2009, commissioners voted for a plan that was largely funded by three different hotel bed taxes that added up to almost $300 million. (The county also pitched in other sources of money, including $50 million from an earlier voter-approved bond referendum that is being paid off with property taxes.) We should note that while tourists pay bed taxes, so does anyone else who stays in a hotel or motel for any reason. That includes business people visiting the area, friends and family who visit local residents, and locals who live in hotels or need a room for the night. In total, the county borrowed about $409 million for the Marlins project, which includes debt service and the cost of issuing the bonds, a county spokeswoman told PolitiFact Florida. The county manager wrote in a memo before the vote that the bed taxes "cannot be used for general government funding purposes such as social services, public safety and public education." But some bed tax dollars can be used for non-sports projects, such as museums and theaters. The stadium was built on city-owned land later deeded over to the county, so the Marlins don’t have to pay property taxes. City of Miami: In March 2009, the city of Miami pledged $94 million for the city-owned, 5,800-spot parking structures (the final cost later dropped). The city also committed $13 million from bed taxes toward stadium construction, and $12 million for other improvements. Marlins: The team agreed to pay about $120 million toward stadium construction, and borrowed an additional $35 million from the county. The team pays rent, starting at about $2.3 million a year, plus 2 percent a year, to pay back that loan. The team is also paying $6 million of the county’s construction costs. The Marlins pays the city about $10 per parking space. If all this weren’t complicated enough, in 2011, the Miami Herald reported that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission -- which was already reviewing the city of Miami’s finances -- had launched a separate probe of the stadium deal, to see if the city misled investors about the parking complex bonds. Experts say that Loria is omitting some key points We interviewed a few stadium financing experts who said that while Loria was correct that hotel bed taxes paid for a huge chunk of the cost, his claim obscured the fact that it was still public money, and it could have been spent on other projects to benefit local taxpayers. "Simply put, Miami is going to get bed tax revenue regardless of whether Marlins park was built. So the implication that the city’s budget wasn’t affected by their decision to allocate their limited tax revenue to stadium construction is disingenuous," said Chris Lafakis, Moody’s senior economist who analyzes Florida, in an email to PolitiFact. We also interviewed Adie Tomer and Siddharth Kulkarni, researchers for the Brookings Institution’s Metropolitan Policy Program. They have argued that the stadium will cost the county $2 billion over 40 years, when all the interest on the borrowing is included. "Focusing on tourist taxes obscures the real essence of debate, which is what can Miami do with this revenue?" Tomer said. "$2 billion is an enormous long-term cost. Those revenues are lost now." Roger Noll, a Stanford economics professor, said that higher taxes on tourists take away money they would have spent in local businesses. "Politically, taxing tourist-related activities (hotels, rental cars) is attractive, because some voters do not understand that a targeted tax hurts the business that is being taxed as well as its customers," he said. Jonah Keri, a baseball writer for ESPN’s Grantland, said Loria’s letter is right on one point: The county should get some of the blame on the stadium deal. "Loria is saying the real idiots here are the government who didn’t protect you from me," Keri said. "That’s true. The thing about Loria is, I don’t think he is that much worse than any other owner. It really is the case that local officials are the ones who bungled this. Any capitalist is going to do this." In an interview with PolitiFact, Marlins president David Samson defended Loria’s claim, noting that bed taxes can’t fund general government functions. "It can’t go to police officers, firefighters, nurses, doctors, ambulance drivers. ... It cannot be used to build park shelters for the homeless, as an example." Our ruling In response to renewed criticism about the 2009 Marlins stadium financing deal, Loria said "The majority of public funding came from hotel taxes, the burden of which is incurred by tourists who are visiting our city, NOT the resident taxpayers." Loria is borrowing from politicians’ playbooks here: He cherry-picked a fact that puts the situation in the best light while omitting a thorough explanation. On the surface, he is correct: Much of the public funding for the stadium came from hotel bed taxes largely (though not entirely) paid for by tourists. But these are still tax revenues that belong to the taxpayer, and if it didn’t go to the Marlins, it would have gone to some other public purpose to benefit those taxpayers. He also ignores that the county will be paying off that debt for decades. His implication that locals can shrug their shoulders at that public cost, and dismiss it as coming from the wallets of out of town tourists, is disingenuous. We rate this claim Half True.

pomt-02322	"Kesha Rogers is not a Democrat."	false	/texas/statements/2014/mar/28/gilberto-hinojosa/kesha-rogers-democrat-favoring-obama-impeachment/	Kesha Rogers of Houston, whom we’ve described as a Lyndon LaRouche Democrat, isn’t even a Democrat, according to the chairman of the Texas Democratic Party. Gilberto Hinojosa said in a Feb. 25, 2014, email blast, "Kesha Rogers is one of the candidates on the ballot for U.S. senator in the Democratic primary -- but do not be fooled. Kesha Rogers is not a Democrat." In the email, Hinojosa pointed out that Rogers favors the impeachment of President Barack Obama. He also said she has "paraded around Texas with a poster of the president with a Hitler mustache. Rogers believes that the U.S. economy is secretly controlled by London financial institutions," Hinojosa wrote, "and she has advocated for colonizing Mars," charges the party told us came from Rogers’ campaign website and a Dec. 6, 2013, news blog post by the Dallas Morning News. "That’s not what real Democrats stand for," Hinojosa wrote. Rogers subsequently placed second to Dallas investor David Alameel in the party’s March 4 primary. She garnered 110,160 votes, or 22 percent of the vote, behind Alameel’s 238,618 votes, or 47 percent. The winner of their May 27, 2014, runoff stands to face Republican Sen. John Cornyn in November. A Rogers adviser, Harley Schlanger, the Western States spokesman for the Lyndon LaRouche PAC, urged us to check Hinojosa’s not-a-Democrat declaration, pointing out that thrice before Rogers has run as a Democrat for a Texas post. The state party has been emphatic about LaRouche Democrats not being mainstream. An example of that: In a March 19, 2014, commentary, LaRouche--a longstanding conspiracy theorist and former presidential candidate--called Obama a lackey for the queen of England intent on global thermonuclear warfare. LaRouche also speculated about Obama’s imprisonment or suicide. Party resolved not to help her Asked for Hinojosa’s back-up evidence, party spokesman Emmanuel Garcia shared a web link to a party-written "fact check" stressing reasons not to consider Rogers a valid Democrat, led by her desire to see Obama impeached. The document includes a resolution approved in December 2013 by its governing body, the State Democratic Executive Committee, stating that party members, officers and candidates are neither required nor encouraged to support the candidacy of any person self-identifying in alignment with the LaRouche movement or LaRouche himself, though they are free to "relate to, describe and interact with any such candidates or campaigns as they individually deem." The resolution closes by stating the party "will have no relationship with the campaign of any person identifying him or herself as aligned with the LaRouche Movement or Lyndon LaRouche; no such campaigns will have access to party materials or data, no listing on the party website and no position of privilege, recognition, or credentialing at party meetings or conventions." Rogers' past candidacies Texas Democrats twice nominated Rogers as the party's candidate to represent the Houston-area 22nd Congressional District and Rogers previously ran for state party chair. In 2010, Rogers carried 53 percent of the primary vote to capture the Democratic nomination for the House seat representing CD 22, according to the Texas Secretary of State’s office, and she won the party’s 2012 nod to represent the district by carrying 51 percent of the primary vote, defeating the other hopeful. At the 2006 Democratic state convention, Rogers finished last among candidates for party chair, attracting 98 delegate votes, or 1.5 percent, according to a June 11, 2006, blog post by the pro-Democratic Burnt Orange Report. So, Rogers is making her fourth run for a post as a Democrat. We turned next to Texas laws touching on party identification. 'Affiliating' with a Texas party Unlike in many states, Texans do not commit to a partisan or independent affiliation when they register to vote. But state law includes language about affiliating with a party. According to chapter 162 of the Texas Election Code, a "person becomes affiliated with a political party when the person: (1) is accepted to vote in the party's primary election; or (2) applies for and is provided an early voting or limited primary ballot to be voted by mail." Also, according to the law, a person affiliates by taking an oath at a precinct convention or a person may affiliate by taking an oath at any time, the law says, while an affiliation expires after the end of an election year or at the start of a subsequent election year, whichever comes first. Rogers' voting history This leads us to a traditional though crude way of gauging a Texan’s lean: their history of voting (or not) in party primaries. Any registered voter can vote in any primary (though they can't switch to the other party's runoffs). Still, as we wrote in a 2010 fact check, voting in a primary doesn't always mean a person sees himself as belonging to that party. Most voters abstain from primaries. To our query, Democratic pollster Jeff Smith of Austin, citing data he jointly owns with the party, said Rogers voted in Harris County in the 2002 through 2008 Democratic primaries and November general elections. He said Rogers voted in the county’s 2014 Democratic primary after voting in Fort Bend County in the 2010 and 2012 Democratic primaries and general elections. He said the records show no instances of Rogers voting in a Republican primary. For her part, Rogers told us she's been a life-long Democrat. "I’m a Democrat because I represent the true traditions of the Democratic Party," Rogers said by phone. "I don’t represent the Wall Street leg of the Democratic Party, which has now taken control." Expert observers Finally, we asked close observers of Texas politics including Mark Jones, an oft-quoted Rice University political scientist, to weigh in. By email, Jones said that it’s inaccurate to say Rogers isn’t a Democrat. "While Kesha Rogers without question holds positions on many issues that are sharply at odds with those of most Democrats," Jones wrote, "she has the right to profess to be a Democrat and run for public office as a Democrat... In the United States in general, and in Texas in particular, anyone can claim to be a Democrat or Republican and compete in that party's primary," Jones said, "even if they hold positions that are anathema to an overwhelming majority of people that identify with and support the party. "Thus, just as Louisiana Republicans two dozen years ago could not prevent former KKK Grand Wizard David Duke from publicly identifying himself as a Republican and running for office as a Republican," Jones said, "Texas Democrats cannot prevent Kesha Rogers from publicly identifying as a Democrat and running in the Democratic primary." Jones added: "While she is clearly in a fringe faction within the Democratic Party, a faction with longstanding roots in the party whose views on many (though not all) major issues are clearly far outside of the Democratic mainstream, her self-identification and political participation are consistently Democratic." Austin lawyer Buck Wood, an expert on election law, said by phone that Hinojosa must have meant Rogers isn’t a genuine Democrat, which the party has often said. (Separately, party spokesman Garcia said Hinojosa wasn't backing off his reference to Rogers as not a Democrat.) Rogers’ filing as a candidate and voting in the 2014 party primary makes her a Democrat, legally speaking, Wood said. Ed Sills, spokesman for the Alameel-backing Texas AFL-CIO, suggested Hinojosa has a case. By email, Sills said the "totality of one’s beliefs, platform and behavior need to be considered in evaluating whether someone is really part of a political party or not." He likened Rogers to the late Gene Kelly, a San Antonio-area resident who repeatedly sought party nominations (sometimes successfully) without showing signs of wanting to help the Democratic ticket. On her campaign website, Sills said, Rogers doesn’t refer to herself solely as a Democrat, instead saying "LaRouche Democrat." But we noticed her site also includes positive references to John F. Kennedy, Franklin Delano Roosevelt and other Democratic heroes. Rogers says on the site: "Texas already has a tradition of FDR-JFK Democrats fighting for the forgotten man, against Wall Street, including: Barbara Jordan, Wright Patman, Henry B. Gonzalez, Jim Wright, and Ralph Yarborough," referring to influential U.S. House members through history and the late liberal senator. Our ruling Hinojosa said Rogers isn’t a Democrat. We don’t see how to factually reconcile this statement, tied to disagreement with Rogers’ anti-Obama views, with Rogers twice winning primaries to become the party’s nominee for a House seat. Under state law, too, a voter affiliates with a party by voting in its primary, which Rogers has done repeatedly. We rate this claim as False. FALSE – The statement is not accurate.

pomt-04309	Says Democrats first proposed prohibiting the government from negotiating prices for prescription drugs in Medicare Part D and he "had nothing to do with" that provision in the law.	mostly false	/wisconsin/statements/2012/oct/30/tommy-thompson/tommy-thompson-says-he-had-nothing-do-provision-ba/	Campaigning for the U.S. Senate, Republican Tommy Thompson called himself the "mastermind" of Medicare Part D, which he pushed while serving as secretary of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. On Oct. 18, 2012, in the second of three debates with Tammy Baldwin, Thompson again took credit for the program and criticized the Democratic congresswoman for voting against it. But he rejected an accusation by Baldwin that he was responsible for one controversial provision. A provision known as "non-interference" -- prohibiting the government from negotiating with drug makers over drug prices -- was first proposed in 1999 by Democrats, notably President Bill Clinton, Thompson claimed. And Thompson said it was Congress that inserted a non-interference clause in the Medicare Part D legislation he pushed, which became law in 2003. "I had nothing to do with it," Thompson said. Baldwin shot back: "You were the quarterback and the mastermind of Medicare Part D, but you had nothing to do with it?" Baldwin has repeatedly attacked Thompson over the non-interference provision and did so again in the pair’s third and final debate a week later. She calls it a "sweetheart deal" for drug companies, saying the government can’t use its bargaining power to try and obtain lower drug prices -- although others counter that competition among private insurers in Part D has led to lower prices. We’ve rated True a claim by Baldwin that the Part D law, "adopted under Thompson’s watch," bars the government from negotiating for "better prices" on prescription drugs. At the time, six weeks before the second debate with Baldwin, Thompson’s campaign said nothing about the non-interference clause being the Democrats’ doing. That’s a different claim. Let’s check it out. Thompson’s case Medicare Part D is an optional insurance program for prescription drugs for people on Medicare. A key feature is that private insurance companies offer a variety of plans and beneficiaries choose the plan that's best for them. The government subsidizes the program but does not run it. Medical Part D was created by the Medicare Modernization Act, which also made other changes to Medicare. It was proposed by President George W. Bush, and Thompson was the administration’s point man on lobbying Congress to create it. When we asked for evidence to back Thompson’s claim that others were responsible for non-interference, his campaign did not respond. But Thompson expounded on his claim both in the second and third debates and in a meeting with Milwaukee Journal Sentinel editors and reporters on the day of the second debate. Thompson said non-interference was first introduced by Clinton and Democratic congressional leaders in a Medicare Part D proposal in 1999, which did not become law. Thompson also maintained that when the Bush administration proposed Part D, it contained only general principles. He said non-interference became part of the law only after it was introduced by then-Rep. Bill Thomas, R-Calif., and Sen. Max Baucus, D-Mont. "I had nothing to do with it, never had a sweetheart deal with anybody," he told the Journal Sentinel. The record The Clinton Part D proposal did, as Thompson said, include a non-interference clause. But the language differs from that in the Medicare Part D that later became law under Bush. Under the Clinton proposal, pharmacy benefit managers would have negotiated on behalf of the federal government with drug manufacturers, said Edwin Park, vice president for health policy at the left-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. But in Bush’s Part D, the government can’t negotiate at all, leaving negotiation up to the individual insurance plans. Park agreed with Thompson that Bush’s Part D proposal was a set of principles and not legislation. But while Democrat Baucus was very involved in the Part D legislation, Republicans controlled both the Senate and the House, Park noted. As for Thompson’s claim that he had "nothing to do" with the non-interference clause that ended up in the law, that didn’t wash with Park or other experts we interviewed. "Any time Congress is involved in major legislation, the administration is heavily involved," said Park. Grace-Marie Turner, president of the Galen Institute, a think tank that promotes free market principles in health care, said the Bush administration clearly supported non-interference to promote competition among private insurers and keep the government out of setting drug prices. "It’s really the key element to allowing this competitive marketplace to work," said Turner, who noted that Medicare Part D has cost less than was anticipated by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office. Indeed, in 2007, when Democrats pushed legislation to repeal non-interference, Bush threatened a veto, arguing that competition among insurers was resulting in lower drug prices. Our rating Thompson said Democrats first proposed prohibiting the government from negotiating prices for prescription drugs in Medicare Part D and he "had nothing to do with" that provision in the final law. Democrats did introduce a version of the so-called non-interference provision, but it didn’t go as far as the provision that became law under Bush. Moreover, Thompson was the point man on Medicare Part D for the Bush administration, which supported non-interference. We rate Thompson’s statement Mostly False.

pomt-01682	Says Marilinda Garcia supports "$150 billion in new taxes."	pants on fire!	/new-hampshire/statements/2014/aug/15/gary-lambert/gop-challenger-gary-lambert-says-rival-marilinda-g/	With New Hampshire voters gearing up for a primary election, Republican candidate for Congress Gary Lambert tried to cast himself as the true fiscal conservative in the race when he distributed a campaign mailer this August. The former state senator from Nashua pledged sound leadership for New Hampshire’s economy if he’s elected to represent the 2nd Congressional District. Lambert also criticized his major opponent in the GOP primary, state Rep. Marilinda Garcia, asserting that Garcia supports "$150 billion in new taxes." Lambert said the move would result in massive job losses, and his campaign flyer pictured Garcia’s face on the side of a building, underneath a sign that reads "Going out of business." With both candidates courting the Republican base, any move to increase taxes could be a turn-off for voters. But is Garcia really pushing for a tax hike, and one that could be measured in billions of dollars? Her campaign quickly denied the charge, and Lambert’s flyer didn’t provide much information to back it up. To get to the bottom of it, PolitiFact New Hampshire asked Lambert’s campaign for an explanation of where the $150 billion figure came from. Campaign manager Josh Davidson pointed us to an April 2014 event at which Garcia said she supports closing some types of tax loopholes. Her remarks were filmed and posted to YouTube by the conservative blog Granite Grok. Garcia said that small businesses are at a disadvantage because, unlike large corporations, they can’t hire lawyers and accountants who are able to "find those loopholes that could reduce your tax rate from 35 (percent) to 20 (percent) like the big companies do." "So that’s a big problem," she continued. "We need to close those types of loopholes." Lambert argues that by calling for Congress to close "those types of loopholes," Garcia was calling for the elimination of the entire system of tax credits, exemptions and other mechanisms that allow companies to lower their taxes. Those mechanisms are collectively known as "tax expenditures," a term the federal government uses to describe revenue lost because of tax deferrals, preferential tax rates, exclusions, exemptions or deductions. Combined, the federal government will provide corporate tax expenditures worth an estimated $148 billion in fiscal 2014, according to numbers crunched by the White House Office of Management and Budget. That’s close to the $150 billion figure cited by Lambert’s campaign. However, there are several caveats to consider. To begin with, it’s hard to know exactly how much new revenue the country would receive if any tax expenditures were eliminated. It wouldn’t necessarily be $148 billion. As the White House’s Office of Management and Budget notes, eliminating one type of tax break may alter economic behavior, or provide an incentive for companies to chase another type of tax break. Also, the system of tax breaks is interdependent -- eliminating one could lower the amount of taxable revenue in another, or move a company into an entirely different tax bracket. There’s also the question of whether the reforms would apply solely to corporations, or if tax breaks for both corporations and individuals would be eliminated. Many are available to both types of taxpayers. In fact, a study by the U.S. Government Accountability Office determined that more than two-thirds of the tax expenditures used by corporations in 2011 were also used by individual taxpayers. That means tax breaks used exclusively by businesses -- the segment Garcia was referencing in her comments -- account for only a portion of the $148 billion worth of corporate tax expenditures. It’s also worth noting that eliminating a loophole isn’t the same thing as instituting a new tax, as Lambert suggests. Any new revenue would simply come from existing taxes. Garcia also disputes the notion that she would support any net increase in taxes. Her communications director, Kenny Cunningham, wrote that Garcia hopes to lower the overall corporate tax rate by eliminating special interest-backed tax loopholes. "Marilinda has pledged multiple times not to support any new increases in the tax burden and has a long voting record in the NH Legislature to prove her commitment to action on this issue, not just words," Cunningham wrote. Our ruling Lambert claimed that Garcia supports $150 billion in new taxes. His statement was based on a remark Garcia made about closing tax loopholes that help big corporations. The Office of Management and Budget estimates in fiscal year 2014, companies will receive about $148 billion in tax expenditures. That’s close to the figure Lambert offered, but overall, the statement is inaccurate for several reasons. Even if one accepts the premise that Garcia wants to end all tax breaks for corporations, the expenditures she’s referring to would probably be valued at less than $150 billion, unless Garcia also supported ending tax breaks that are available to both companies and individuals. According to her campaign manager, Garcia would not support any increase in the tax burden. Instead, she seeks to eliminate loopholes that benefit special interests while working to lower the overall corporate tax rate. Not only is Lambert’s campaign mailer inaccurate, but it offers such an astronomically high figure that the claim is far-fetched. For these reasons, Lambert’s claim earns a rating of Pants on Fire.

pomt-06002	Says an Obama administration policy prohibits people who work with at-risk youth from promoting marriage as a way to avoid poverty.	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/jan/19/rick-santorum/rick-santorum-says-obama-prohibits-encouraging-you/	Rick Santorum says the president has issued a gag order on talking to young people about marriage. During a debate in South Carolina on Jan. 16, 2012, Santorum gave a winding answer to a moderator’s question about combating poverty. He mentioned a study that he said found that people who have a job, earn a high school diploma and get married before having children are far less likely to be poor. "It's a huge, huge opportunity for us," he said. "But what is the Obama administration doing?" The White House, Santorum said, "now has regulations that tell (people who work with at-risk youths) that they can no longer promote marriage to these young girls. They can no longer promote marriage as a way of avoiding poverty and bad choices that they make in their life." It was a vague claim but one that piqued our curiosity. What’s behind this? We reached out to Santorum’s campaign to ask for the basis of the claim but didn’t get a reply. In the debate, the former Pennsylvania senator said he learned about the no-marriage rule from Elayne Bennett, founder and president of the Best Friends Foundation. The organization provides character education for at-risk girls in Washington, D.C., schools. Its message to adolescents, according to Bennett: "that the best decision is to reject the risk behaviors of sex, drugs and alcohol." Bennett is the wife of Bill Bennett, former education secretary under President Ronald Reagan and drug czar under President George H.W. Bush. Both Bennetts are well-known conservatives. In an interview, Elayne Bennett told us Santorum’s statement was incorrect with regard to marriage. Here’s some background: Best Friends Foundation was awarded a five-year, $2.5 million grant by the Department of Health and Human Services under President George W. Bush. The Healthy Marriage Grant, which included a component for counseling inner-city teenagers on the benefits of marriage, addressed issues such as abuse prevention and life skills. But Bennett said that about two years ago, after Obama was elected, one aspect of the grant’s terms changed. "We were not to discuss abstinence or sex as a risk behavior," Bennett said. "It was a verbal instruction that we had to remove that word -- abstinence -- from our curriculum materials, which we did because we wanted to adhere to the new policy." Bennett says she rejects the label "abstinence-only" for what she teaches but said, "we do recommend that the best choice for young people is to say no to risk behaviors." Formerly that meant encouraging girls to wait to have sex -- until the grant terms changed. But she said the change never applied to discussing the benefits of marriage, and she thought Santorum’s statement in the debate left that impression. She said she spoke to him the next day, and he acknowledged it was "lost in the translation." In the debate, Santorum added that the White House had restricted federal grantees from talking about abstinence and described why he thinks that’s harmful. "They (the grantees) have to be neutral with respect to how people behave," Santorum said. "The problem is neutrality ends in poverty, neutrality ends in choices that hurt people's lives. This administration is deliberately telling organizations that are there to help young girls make good choices, not to tell them what the good choice is. That is absolutely unconscionable." Bennett, who also issued a statement clarifying Santorum’s error, said she still agrees with his broader point about the benefits of discussing abstinence. Source of the confusion The Department of Health and Human Services told us that its position (in the prior administration and in this administration) stems from a 2006 law signed by President George W. Bush. Called the Deficit Reduction Act of 2005, it identifies eight activities on which healthy marriage funds can be used. Here, word for word, are the eight activities listed in the statute: • Public advertising campaigns on the value of marriage and the skills needed to increase marital stability and health. • Education in high schools on the value of marriage, relationship skills and budgeting. • Marriage education, marriage skills, and relationship skills programs that may include parenting skills, financial management, conflict resolution and job and career advancement. • Pre-marital education and marriage skills training for engaged couples and for couples or individuals interested in marriage. • Marriage enhancement and marriage skills training programs for married couples. • Divorce reduction programs that teach relationship skills. • Marriage mentoring programs which use married couples as role models and mentors in at-risk communities. • Programs to reduce the disincentives to marriage in means-tested aid programs … . Clearly, promoting marriage is an express purpose of this grant, not prohibiting promoting it. A 2008 report by the Government Accountability Office review of the grant found that there was confusion among grant recipients and HHS staff about what was allowed to be taught about abstinence. "HHS officials told us that abstinence education was not allowable under the Healthy Marriage program, but we observed during our site visits and review of grantee data several Healthy Marriage grantees operating programs that focused on abstinence education," the report states. To clear up confusion, HHS said that in 2011 they made the existing policy more explicit but did not change the policy. The department also added that the topic of abstinence can be one component of some of these activities, but a stand-alone abstinence education program does not fit within the statutory uses of the funds. Our ruling Santorum said the Obama administration is not allowing people who work with at-risk adolescents to promote the benefits of marriage. Santorum said he had heard this from Elayne Bennett of the Best Friends Foundation, but she told us he misspoke. The change under Obama, according to Bennett, was about what could be taught regarding abstinence -- not marriage. The Department of Health and Human Services said there was confusion in this area, so it clarified the policy, which does allow discussion of abstinence in other contexts but not as a stand-alone education program. Santorum simply got it wrong. His statement is False.	None	Rick Santorum	None	None	None	2012-01-19T18:09:38	2012-01-16	['Barack_Obama']

pomt-02739	Goodwill Industries International pays workers with disabilities wages as low as pennies per hour.	half-true	/georgia/statements/2013/dec/18/national-federation-blind/goodwill-faces-criticism-over-pay-disabled-workers/	Workers’ wages have become a lightning rod issue recently. Fast-food employees have lobbied for an increase in the minimum wage. Earlier this year, Wal-Mart workers protested low wages at the mega store. And President Barack Obama is now backing a proposal by congressional Democrats to raise the minimum wage from $7.25 to $10.10 an hour and tie it to inflation. The wage discussion has spilled over into jobs for disabled workers as well, with the National Federation of the Blind claiming Goodwill Industries International doesn’t adequately compensate its disabled workers. The NFB recently organized a public awareness campaign with members of local chapters delivering petitions to Goodwill affiliates nationwide asking the company to change its payroll practices that allow "payment of wages as low as pennies per hour to workers with disabilities." "For over seventy years, Section 14(c) of the Fair Labor Standards Act has allowed employers to obtain special wage certificates that permit them to pay their workers with disabilities wages far less than the federal minimum," said a news release from the organization. Is Goodwill really paying some employees pennies per hour? We decided to investigate. Goodwill Industries is a nonprofit organization that provides job training and placement, among other services, to people with disabilities. The company comprises 165 independent, community-based affiliates in the United States and Canada, according to its website. There are four regional Goodwill offices in Georgia. When it comes to pay, Goodwill has long faced criticism. Earlier this year, the company was featured on NBC’s "Rock Center with Brian Williams" in a segment claiming that some disabled workers at the company’s Pennsylvania affiliates were paid as little as 22 cents an hour. Forbes reported that some Goodwill workers in Montana earn less than $4 per hour sorting and hanging clothes in stores. Salon and the Huffington Post have also reported on the low wages. Company officials said the cases highlighted in those reports are special cases and were not indicative of Goodwill’s overall pay scale, which has most workers earning at least minimum wage. According to corporate officials, only 64 affiliate agencies pay disabled workers below minimum wage and 101 do not, said Chris Danielsen, the NFB’s spokesman. "(Goodwill) says it’s a local decision by each affiliate to pay workers below minimum wage. And that this affects only 7,000 workers; our point is that it should not affect any," he told PolitiFact Georgia. Critics have also noted the high pay of Goodwill President and CEO Jim Gibbons, who is also blind. An Internal Revenue Service 990 form reports that Gibbons’ pay was more than $508,000 in 2011, plus an additional $217,000 in other compensation. Last year’s report, which is posted on the agency’s website, listed Gibbons’ pay at more than $533,000, plus an additional $99,000 in other compensation. So how is Goodwill allowed to pay workers below the federal minimum wage? And what about disabled workers at Georgia’s Goodwill affiliates, is their pay also lower than $7.25 an hour? In an online response to media reports and questions about its payroll practices, Goodwill Industries highlights the Special Minimum Wage Certificate, authorized under the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938. This provision, Section 14(c) of the law, allows employers to pay people with disabilities below the federal minimum wage. The organization also produced a position paper on the issue. "The certificate is not a ‘loophole,’ " reads the Goodwill corporate statement, which goes on to note, "eliminating this program would harm -- not help -- people with significant multiple disabilities." We called each of the four regional Georgia affiliates covering the Atlanta, Columbus, Macon and Savannah areas to determine their compensation policies. There are no workers paid below minimum wage at stores or offices in the Macon region, a spokeswoman told us. The region possesses the 14(c) special wage certificate but doesn’t use it, she said. The North Georgia affiliate, which includes the Atlanta area, does not have the 14(c) certificate and pays all its some 2,500 disabled workers at least minimum wage, a spokeswoman said. All workers in the Columbus region are also paid at least minimum wage, and the affiliate does not have the 14(c) certificate allowing for lower wages. More than 30 percent of the 700 Goodwill employees in the Savannah region are disabled, a spokeswoman said. The region does hold a 14(c) certificate but doesn’t use it, and the lowest hourly wage offered employees in the region is $7.75 an hour. Despite the Georgia results, the state chapter of the NFB has criticized Georgia’s Goodwill affiliates for about two years, asking the regions with the special wage certificates to eliminate them. Nationally, the NFB is supporting congressional legislation, introduced by U.S. Rep. Gregg Harper, R-Miss., that would repeal the section of the federal law that allows special wage certificates. Georgia Democratic Congressmen Sanford Bishop and John Lewis have signed on as co-sponsors of the bill. The NFB has started an online Change.org petition for Goodwill Industries International to pay its workers a real wage. Thus far, more than 170,000 people have signed on to the petition. So is the National Federation of the Blind correct that Goodwill Industries pays some disabled employees pennies per hour? Yes and no. The international nonprofit, like other organizations that employ disabled workers, is allowed to pay those employees below minimum wage because of a provision of the federal labor law. For Goodwill, which allows each of its independent affiliates to determine whether to use the reduced wage allowance, the pay scale varies. Some affiliates pay workers minimum wage and even more, while other affiliates do pay extremely low wages, depending on the situation and how much work employees are able to complete. In Georgia, all four affiliates pay disabled workers at least minimum wage. And two affiliates possess the lower wage certificate, which they could eventually decide to use. We rate the NFB’s claim Half True.	None	National Federation of the Blind	None	None	None	2013-12-18T06:00:00	2013-10-31	['None']
pomt-07949	"We are living with a legacy of deficit-spending that began almost a decade ago."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/jan/25/barack-obama/ten-years-deficits-even-more/	One of the themes of President Barack Obama's State of the Union address was the need to take control of the national budget. "Now, the final step – a critical step – in winning the future is to make sure we aren't buried under a mountain of debt," Obama said. "We are living with a legacy of deficit-spending that began almost a decade ago. And in the wake of the financial crisis, some of that was necessary to keep credit flowing, save jobs, and put money in people's pockets. But now that the worst of the recession is over, we have to confront the fact that our government spends more than it takes in. That is not sustainable. Every day, families sacrifice to live within their means. They deserve a government that does the same." His comment had a partisan undertone. By saying deficit spending began almost a decade ago, he is referring to the presidency of George W. Bush. We wanted to review the history of deficit spending and put Obama's statement in a bit of perspective. To do that, we turned to the historical tables on the federal budget published by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office. Obama said that deficit spending "began almost a decade ago." The historical data shows that from 2009 to 2002, the country did indeed run deficits. There's no doubt once the 2010 numbers are fully compiled, they too will show a deficit. You have to go back to the time of President Bill Clinton, working with a Republican Congress, to find budget surpluses. The historical tables show surpluses for the years 1998 to 2001. But the nation's debt did not begin under President Bush. The historical data show the government ran deficits from at least 1970 to 1998. (The CBO's most recent summary of historical data only goes back to 1970.) So that includes deficits under Republicans Richard Nixon, Ronald Reagan and George H.W. Bush, as well as Democrats Jimmy Carter and Bill Clinton (for much of his presidency). So Obama isn't telling the full story by saying the legacy of deficit spending began a decade ago. It goes back even farther than that. We should point out that deficits are not the same thing as government debt. When the government spends more than it takes in during a single year, that's a deficit. Add up the deficits over many years, minus any surpluses, and you get the public debt. So even when there were surpluses under the Clinton administration, there was still significant public debt. But the surpluses meant that the overall debt was getting smaller. There's one caveat to Obama's statement. Deficits started again 2002, at $157.8 billion that year. They got a bigger after that, hitting $412.7 billion in 2004, but started shrinking again in 2005. The recession hit in 2008, and the deficit ticked up to $458.6 billion. But thanks to the stimulus and a deepening recession, the deficit got much bigger in 2009 -- it hit $1.414 trillion in 2009, according to the CBO statistics. And to get even wonkier, you can look at deficits as a percentage of the Gross Domestic Product, a metric that accounts for inflation and economic growth. (The Gross Domestic Product is a measurement of the size of the entire U.S. economy.) If you look at it this way, the 2009 deficit is the largest since at least 1970, at 9.9 percent. The next largest deficit was in 1983, when it was 6.6 percent. Obama is correct that there was a turning point toward deficit spending a decade ago. But he isn't telling the full story of the nation's deficits, a "legacy" that began long before George W. Bush was president. We rate the claim Half True.

pomt-09228	"Louisiana Sen. Mary Landrieu received almost $1.8 million from BP over the last decade."	pants on fire!	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/may/14/ed-schultz/schultz-claims-landrieu-got-18-million-bp-pac-and-/	Newsflash: The oil and gas industry gives a lot of money to politicians. Among them is Sen. Mary Landrieu, a Louisiana Democrat whose state stands to be hardest hit by the thousands of barrels of oil gushing from BP's Deepwater Horizon well in the Gulf of Mexico. Here's what Ed Schultz, the liberal host of MSNBC's Ed Show, had to say about her share of the dough: "Americans are getting a real education on what the color of oil is," Schultz said on the May 5, 2010, episode of his show. "It's green. It's real green. It's big money and influence. Just so you know what's coming down, Louisiana Sen. Mary Landrieu received almost $1.8 million from BP over the last decade." That's quite a bit of cash, so we decided to look into the claim. It turns out that the $1.8 million figure has been one of Schultz's regular talking points. On May 6, Schultz criticized Landrieu for defending the oil industry while small businesses in the region could be wiped out by the disaster. "We have interviewed people on this program in recent days that are on the verge of not only losing their family business of 80 years, their clientele right now, and wiping out the whole industry, yet you are concerned about the liability limits on big insurance and oil?" he said. "Sen. Landrieu, you‘re really looking out for people, aren't you? Or is it just that $1.8 million worth of money to your campaign speaking right now from BP?" And on May 11, 2010, Schultz said, "We should point out that Senator Landrieu has taken $1.8 million from BP over the last 10 years," shortly after an interview with Landrieu ended. We checked that figure against data from OpenSecrets.org, a website that tracks campaign contributions. Between 2000 and 2009, BP employees and the company's political action committee contributed $25,200 to Landrieu. And since Landrieu was elected to Congress in 1996, BP employees and the company's political action committee have given her a total of $28,200. (So far, Landrieu hasn't received any money from the company's workers or PAC in 2010, so we excluded that year from our analysis.) To put those campaign contributions to Landrieu in perspective, the company's employees and action committee have donated a total of $4,734,181 to all federal candidates since 1996, when Landrieu's congressional career began. That means that during her entire time in the Senate, Landrieu's only gotten about 0.6 percent of BP's action committee and employees' total contributions. Both figures are a far cry from the $1.8 million Schultz claimed on his show. Alana Russo, Schultz's spokeswoman, said that the original figure came from a May 4 CNN story; the news organization has since corrected the error. She also pointed out that Schultz issued his own correction on May 12. "In recent days we have been reporting on this program on two different occasions that Sen. Mary Landrieu of Louisiana had taken $1.8 million from BP," he said. "I want to come off the top tonight and correct that number. It is $752,000... I want all of you to know our apologies from me, Ed Schultz, on this. I don‘t like getting my numbers wrong." But Schultz did get the numbers wrong - again. Indeed, Landrieu has received $752,744 from all the oil and gas industry's political action committees and employees -- not just BP -- during her entire career. Schultz initially said that Landrieu had received $1.8 million from BP in the last decade, so his "correction" is an apples-to-oranges comparison. (We should also note that OpenSecrets is in the middle of updating some of its information; according to the organization, the most up-to-date figure is actually $758,744. But that number is available only on some parts of the OpenSecrets site.) Furthermore, he said that he'd reported the $1.8 million figure twice on his show. But we found that he mentioned the statistic three times. Russo told us Schultz is planning to issue an additional correction on his May 14 show. So how to rate it on the Truth-O-Meter? Given Schultz's incorrect correction, we won't wait for a new one. He repeatedly claimed that Landrieu had made $1.8 million from BP employees and PAC in campaign contributions over the last decade. We found that she's only made $25,200 from them in that period of time. That's a huge difference. Schultz eventually issued a correction, saying that Landrieu's only gotten $752,000. But Landrieu has received about that much during her entire career from the entire oil and gas industry, not just BP's political action committee and employees. Pants on Fire!

pomt-06791	"Twenty-five states have lower unemployment than Texas" which is "tied with Mississippi for more minimum-wage jobs than anywhere in the United States."	true	/texas/statements/2011/aug/16/lloyd-doggett/lloyd-doggett-says-texas-has-worse-unemployment-25/	U.S. Rep. Lloyd Doggett told ABC News on Aug. 11, 2011, that Gov. Rick Perry’s rosy depictions of employment conditions in Texas aren’t entirely accurate. "Twenty-five states have lower unemployment than Texas does today," the Austin Democrat said, adding that "we're tied with Mississippi for more minimum-wage jobs than anywhere in the United States." Is Texas middling in unemployment and tied with the Magnolia State for minimum-wage jobs? Yes and yup. According to the latest monthly state-by-state unemployment rates, posted by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, Texas’ seasonally adjusted June unemployment rate of 8.2 percent placed it 26th among the 50 states. North Dakota had the lowest rate, 3.2 percent. The most populous states faring better than Texas were Pennsylvania, ranked 18th (7.6 percent), and New York, which was 23rd (8 percent). Regarding minimum-wage workers, the Austin American-Statesman said in a July 17 news article that Texas and Mississippi led the nation last year with 9.5 percent of hourly workers earning at or less than the federal minimum hourly wage of $7.25. Hourly workers aren’t the entire labor force, which the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics defines as adults who are working plus those lately looking and available for work. The Statesman story says that according to the bureau, 550,000 Texans earned no more than the minimum wage in 2010, and the number of Texas workers earning the federal minimum wage or less was greater than the totals for California, Florida and Illinois combined. In the story, Lori Taylor, an associate professor in the Bush School of Government and Public Service at Texas A&M University, attributes the state’s lower wages to its having a younger, less educated workforce and a lower cost of living. In March, the Bureau of Labor Statistics said in an online post that nearly 5.8 million Texas workers were paid hourly rates in 2010, representing 55.7 percent of the state’s workers, a proportion that compares with 58.8 percent nationally. A bureau economist, Steven Haugen, told us in an interview that most other workers are salaried, though some work on commission or do piece work; the bureau doesn’t collect data on those workers’ pay rates, he said. A table in the bureau’s post lists each state and its percentage of hourly workers paid at or below minimum wage (people who work for tips and worker younger than 20 are among those who can be paid less than minimum wage). Texas and Mississippi each had 9.5 percent of hourly workers paid at or less than minimum wage, tying for first among the states. Under Texas law, employers must pay workers the federal minimum wage. Alabama and West Virginia, at 9.3 percent, were next highest, followed by Louisiana (8.9 percent), Oklahoma (8.6 percent), Georgia (8.5 percent), Tennessee (8.3 percent), Kentucky (8.1 percent) and Missouri (8 percent). Washington, which has a state minimum wage rate higher than the federal rate, had the lowest share of hourly workers paid at or below minimum wage, 1.1 percent. In sheer numbers, Texas had 268,000 hourly workers earning minimum wage and 282,000 paid below the minimum wage, the bureau says, the most of any state by a wide margin. Almost 13 percent of the nation’s hourly workers paid at or below the minimum wage were in Texas, the second most-populous state with more than 25 million residents, or about 8 percent of the nation’s population, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. Mississippi, with almost 3 million residents, had 34,000 and 29,000 hourly workers, respectively, earning the minimum wage or less. We rate Doggett’s statement True.

pomt-07413	Says the hospital listed on Barack Obama’s just-publicized long-form birth certificate denies the president was born there.	pants on fire!	/texas/statements/2011/apr/27/leo-berman/state-rep-leo-berman-says-kapiolani-medical-center/	Trying to quell recurrent unfounded claims that he wasn’t born in Hawaii, President Barack Obama released his long-form birth certificate Wednesday. In a White House news conference, the president said he was releasing the document in order to move on from the so-called "birther" issue: "We have to make a series of very difficult decisions about how we invest in our future but also get a hold of the deficit and debt. But we're not going to be able to do it if we are distracted. We're not going to be able to do it if we just make stuff up and pretend that facts are not facts." Nevertheless, Obama said, there will likely be "a segment of people" for whom the evidence of his birth certificate is not enough. Indeed, shortly after Obama spoke, state Rep. Leo Berman, R-Tyler, said he’s still not persuaded that Obama was born in a Honolulu hospital, according to the Texas Tribune. The Tribune reported that Berman, who has filed legislation to require presidential candidates who want to appear on the Texas ballot to present their birth certificate to the secretary of state, "claims the hospital Obama lists on his birth certificate — in fact, all hospitals in Honolulu — have denied the president was born there." We followed up with Berman, who told us that two hospitals, including Kapiolani Medical Center For Women and Children, where Obama says he was born, have denied it. He couldn’t recall the name of the other hospital. Asked where and when the hospitals made the denials, Berman told us: "In several places over the past year and a half," but provided no more specifics. "Neither hospital recognized the fact that he was born there and not only that, but you would think that the hospital that gave birth to the president of the United States would have some kind of commemorative plaque or something." Berman also said that "it’s going to take someone with a lot of money like Donald Trump to take a look at this and see if Kapiolani will admit whether or not he was born there." Trump, a possible GOP presidential candidate, has repeatedly suggested that Obama was not born in the United States. Earlier this month, for example, he said Obama’s "grandmother in Kenya said he was born in Kenya and she was there and witnessed his birth." PolitiFact rated that statement False. Responding to a 2008 question about whether "she was present when he was born in Kenya," Obama’s grandmother, who speaks Swahili, at first said through a translator that she was. Then she clearly and repeatedly corrected herself, saying that he was born in the United States. A subset of Obama critics, dubbed "birthers," doubt that he is a natural-born U.S. citizen, a requirement to serve as president. PolitiFact has checked at least five other claims about Obama’s birthplace, finding no truth to any of them. One was a February claim by Berman, who said Hawaii’s governor "can’t find anything that says (Obama) was born in Hawaii." Finding no evidence that the governor said that, we rated his claim False. We searched the Lexis-Nexis database, which archives news articles, and the Internet, where skepticism about Obama’s proof of citizenship thrives, for assertions that Kapiolani hospital had ever denied that it was the site of Obama’s birth. We found no instances of hospital officials making that assertion. However, we found a Jan. 18 story by World Net Daily, a conservative news website that has fanned the birth certificate controversy, reporting that a former Honolulu elections official had said that Kapiolani hospital has no record that Obama was born there. Two days later, Hollywood reporter Mike Evans, claiming to be a longtime friend of Hawaii Gov. Neil Abercrombie’s, told Minnesota’s KQRS-FM radio that the governor had told him that he had searched "everywhere using his powers as governor" at Kapiolani and Queen’s hospitals and that "there is no Barack Obama birth certificate in Hawaii. Absolutely no proof at all that he was born in Hawaii." However, FoxNews.com later quoted Evans as saying that he had misspoken. "I haven’t talked to Neil since he’s been governor," he said. According to Fox, Evans said that he called Abercrombie’s office after reading online reports that the governor couldn’t find Obama’s birth certificate but Abercrombie did not return his call. Obama’s newly-released long-form birth certificate contradicts those reports — and Berman’s claim. The document says that Barack Hussein Obama II was born at Kapiolani Maternity & Gynecological Hospital at 7:24 p.m. Aug. 4, 1961. We attempted to reach officials from the Kapiolani Medical Center for Woman and Children on Wednesday and didn’t hear back. But as FactCheck.org reported in its April 9 look at Trump’s claims, Kapiolani can’t legally release individually identifiable health information, which the 1996 Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) prohibits. Individually identifiable health information, according to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, is information relating to the provision of health care to an individual, or anything that can reasonably be used to identify the individual, such as a name, address, birth date or Social Security number. An individual’s health information can only be shared under certain circumstances, according to the site, such as reporting a gunshot wound to the police. Protected information includes information in an individual’s medical record, and health providers must comply with an individual’s right to decide whether or not health information can be shared for certain purposes. In July 2009, World Net Daily quoted Kristy Watanabe, a spokeswoman at Hawaii Pacific Health, which includes the Kapiolani hospital, as saying: "Our comment to everyone who has been calling is that federal law does not permit us to provide any more details concerning information about Obama’s birth without authorization from Mr. Obama." However, the medical center has promoted a January 2009 letter Obama wrote on White House stationery to congratulate the medical center on its centennial celebration. "Kapiolani was one of Hawaii’s earliest hospitals, and it has served many generations of Hawaii’s people with distinction," the letter says. "As a beneficiary of the excellence of Kapiolani Medical Center — the place of my birth — I am pleased to add my voice to your chorus of supporters." The Foundations of Hawaii Pacific Health published the letter in the spring 2009 issue of its Inspire magazine, and the medical center posted video of Abercrombie reading Obama’s letter at the centennial dinner on its website. For CNN’s recent investigation into "birther" claims, which aired April 25-26, CNN reporter Gary Tuchman traveled to Hawaii to conduct numerous interviews, including one with Monika Danielson, who says she was in the hospital at the same time as Obama's mother and saw him in the nursery. He also interviewed Chiyome Fukino, who was the state Health Department's director under Republican Gov. Linda Lingle. The bottom line, according to Tuchman: His research "reveals what most analysts have been saying since the 'birther' controversy erupted during the 2008 presidential campaign: Obama was born in Hawaii on Aug. 4, 1961. Period." So far as we can tell, Kapiolani hasn’t confirmed that Obama was born there, citing federal privacy law that prevents it from doing so. But we found no record that the hospital has ever denied it, as Berman claims. Nor did the lawmaker provide evidence of such. We have a rating for such statements. Pants on Fire!

pomt-10316	"I have repeatedly said that many of the predatory loans that were made in the mortgage system did target African-American and Latino communities."	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/aug/01/barack-obama/obama-cites-ethnicity-in-mortgage-crisis/	In a town hall in St. Petersburg, Fla., an audience member challenged Obama about speaking out on issues affecting the black community, including the subprime mortgage crisis, among other issues. "Why is it that you have not had the ability to not one time speak to the interests and even speak on behalf of the oppressed and exploited African community or the black community in this country?" the man asked. Not true, Obama replied. "I think you're misinformed about when you say not one time. Every issue you've spoken about, I actually did speak out on," Obama said. "I have repeatedly said that many of the predatory loans that were made in the mortgage system did target African-American and Latino communities," Obama said. He went on to defend his record on other civil rights issues. We wondered if Obama's statement on the subprime mortgage was true, so we looked through press releases, transcripts and news stories to find out. Most notably, on Oct. 18, 2007, Obama wrote a letter to the Federal Trade Commission asking it to investigate subprime lenders to determine whether minority borrowers have been victims of discrimination. Obama wrote in his leter that there was already substantial evidence to indicate this was so. "Black families are paying more for home loans than similarly situated white families. Effective action to address this disparity is long overdue," Obama wrote. On the campaign trail, Obama has also discussed the same issue several times, though we found most of our examples of him discussing it before Hispanic audiences. On June 28, 2008, Obama told the National Association of Latino Elected and Appointed Officials, "We have to stabilize the housing market. And the Latino community as well as the African-American community was particularly hard hit when it comes to foreclosures." On Feb. 19, 2008, Obama was at a campaign event in San Antonio, Texas, and discussed the need for people having mortgage problems to receive help negotiating with their lenders. "My suspicion is that it's very important we have Spanish-speaking counselors because I know that both the African-American community and Hispanic community have been disproportionately targeted by some of these practices." It's not a campaign theme he hits over and over again, but Obama has made the statement several times, and the 2007 letter is particularly strong evidence to bolster Obama's argument. We rule his statement True.	None	Barack Obama	None	None	None	2008-08-01T00:00:00	2008-08-01	['None']
pomt-13682	Says, regarding the presence of classified information in her email, FBI Director James "Comey said my answers were truthful, and what I've said is consistent with what I have told the American people."	pants on fire!	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/aug/01/hillary-clinton/hillary-clintons-wrong-claim-fbi-director-comey-ca/	Hillary Clinton said that she has told the public a consistent and truthful story about classified material on her emails, and FBI director James Comey backed her up. That immediately caught our attention. On the July 31 edition of Fox News Sunday, host Chris Wallace played a video montage of several times Clinton said something like: "I am confident that I never sent nor received any information that was classified at the time." Wallace remarked, "After a long investigation, FBI director James Comey said none of those things that you told the American public were true." That’s not what Clinton heard Comey say, she responded. "Director Comey said my answers were truthful, and what I've said is consistent with what I have told the American people, that there were decisions discussed and made to classify retroactively certain of the emails," she said. Clinton appears to have selective hearing. In saying Comey called her answers "truthful," Clinton was apparently referring to — and putting a positive spin on — a comment Comey made in a July 7 congressional hearing regarding Clinton’s closed-door interview with the FBI as part of their investigation. Comey said, "We have no basis to conclude she lied to the FBI." In her interview with Wallace, Clinton was making the point that what she told the public is consistent with what she told the FBI, and Comey said what she told the FBI was "truthful," campaign spokesman Josh Schwerin said. So Clinton’s statement implies that Comey has confirmed that her public comments are accurate. That is incorrect. Rep. Jason Chaffetz, R-Utah, asked Comey at the July 7 congressional hearing, "Did she lie to the public?" Comey responded, "That's a question I'm not qualified to answer." He also said he hadn’t compared Clinton’s public comments with the FBI interview to see if there were inconsistencies. There is no transcript of the FBI interview. When Comey announced the FBI’s findings July 5, it was clear that there are obvious inconsistencies between what Clinton said publicly about classified information on her private email server before her FBI interview and what the FBI found. Pointedly, Clinton said there wasn’t any classified information in her email, and he said there was. Take the video Wallace played on Fox News Sunday. In it, Clinton said, "I did not email any classified material to anyone on my email. There is no classified materials" (March 10, 2015); "I am confident that I never sent nor received any information that was classified at the time" (July 25, 2015); "I had not sent classified material nor received anything marked classified" (Aug. 18, 2015). But Comey reported that, of the tens of thousands of emails investigators reviewed, 113 individual emails contained classified information, and three of them bore markings signifying their classification status. (Information can still be classified even if it does not have a label.) Eight email threads contained top-secret information, the highest level of classification, 36 contained secret information, and the remaining eight contained confidential information. About 2,000 emails have been retroactively classified, or up-classified, meaning the information was not classified when it was emailed, but it is now. "Although we did not find clear evidence that Secretary Clinton or her colleagues intended to violate laws governing the handling of classified information, there is evidence that they were extremely careless in their handling of very sensitive, highly classified information," Comey said in a July 5 statement. Then, there was this exchange between Comey and Rep. Trey Gowdy, R-S.C., at the congressional hearing: Gowdy: "Secretary Clinton said there was nothing marked classified on her emails either sent or received. Was that true?" Comey: "That’s not true." Gowdy: "Secretary Clinton said, ‘I did not email any classified material to anyone on my email. There is no classified material.’ Was that true?" Comey: "There was classified material emailed." In fairness to Clinton, Comey said some of the classified emails were insufficiently marked, and it’s understandable that she didn’t realize that some of the ones without labels were actually classified. But he also said of some of the classified emails that did not bear markings, "There is evidence to support a conclusion that any reasonable person in Secretary Clinton's position or in the position of those with whom she was corresponding about the matters should have known that an unclassified system was no place for that conversation." We’ll also note a couple other major inconsistencies between Clinton’s remarks and the FBI’s findings: Clinton repeatedly said she turned over all work-related emails to the State Department in 2014, about 30,000 emails. However, Comey said FBI investigators uncovered "several thousand" work-related emails that she had not handed over to the State Department. And, Clinton has said her email servers "had numerous safeguards. It was on property guarded by the Secret Service. And there were no security breaches." Comey said that while there’s no evidence anyone successfully hacked Clinton’s email servers, they certainly were susceptible to attack. There was no full-time security staff, which are found at government agencies and commercial email providers like Google. Further, he noted that Clinton used her personal email abroad, which could have allowed "hostile actors" to access her account. Our ruling Clinton said regarding the presence of classified information in her email, FBI director James "Comey said my answers were truthful, and what I've said is consistent with what I have told the American people." A reasonable person would interpret Clinton’s statement to mean that Comey has endorsed her public remarks about her email. This is not the case. Talking specifically about Clinton’s closed-door FBI interview, Comey said there is "no basis to conclude she lied to the FBI" about her email practices. But Comey has specifically declined to comment on whether Clinton’s public remarks have been accurate. Further, while not explicitly rebuking Clinton’s public comments, Comey highlighted a major problem with them. Clinton repeatedly said she did not have any classified information whatsoever in her email, marked or unmarked. After the FBI investigation, including the interview with Clinton, Comey said she unequivocally did. We rate her claim Pants on Fire.

pomt-10328	Says Obama flip-flopped on withdrawing troops from Iraq.	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/jul/24/let-freedom-ring/his-tone-changed-but-not-his-position/	A new TV ad from the conservative group Let Freedom Ring echoes a charge made by Sen. John McCain's campaign that Sen. Barack Obama has flip-flopped on withdrawing troops from Iraq. The allegation is based on comments Obama made on July 3, 2008, when he discussed an upcoming trip to Iraq and what it would mean for his foreign policy. "I've always said that the pace of withdrawal would be dictated by the safety and security of our troops and the need to maintain stability. That assessment has not changed," he said. "And when I go to Iraq and have a chance to talk to some of the commanders on the ground, I'm sure I'll have more information and will continue to refine my policies." The McCain campaign pounced on those comments, charging Obama with flip-flopping. "Since announcing his campaign in 2007, the central premise of Barack Obama's candidacy was his commitment to begin withdrawing American troops from Iraq immediately," said Brian Rogers, a McCain spokesman. "Today, Barack Obama reversed that position proving once again that his words do not matter. He has now adopted John McCain's position that we cannot risk the progress we have made in Iraq by beginning to withdraw our troops immediately without concern for conditions on the ground." Let Freedom Ring made the same point in its TV ad. We examined other claims from the ad in this article. Here, we'll examine the Iraq charge. (Much of the material below comes from this previous item that explored the McCain flip-flop charge.) We examined Obama's statements on Iraq from the campaign to try to uncover whether he was backtracking on earlier promises. Iraq was one of the most pressing issues of the Democratic primary, discussed and dissected during more than 20 debates. We found that Obama has made a few points about Iraq over and over again: that he opposed the war "from the start"; that U.S. troops should leave Iraq quickly and in an orderly fashion ("as careful getting out as we were careless getting in"); and that the United States should not have permanent bases inside Iraq. How quickly should troops leave? His campaign Web site says the following: "Obama will immediately begin to remove our troops from Iraq. He will remove one to two combat brigades each month, and have all of our combat brigades out of Iraq within 16 months. Obama will make it clear that we will not build any permanent bases in Iraq. He will keep some troops in Iraq to protect our embassy and diplomats; if al-Qaida attempts to build a base within Iraq, he will keep troops in Iraq or elsewhere in the region to carry out targeted strikes on al-Qaida." The McCain campaign and the RNC have pointed to the "16 months" statement as an indication that Obama favors a "precipitous withdrawal," presumably as early as the middle of 2010. (We checked that claim earlier here and found it Half True.) They also point to a March 2008 statement from Obama's campaign manager David Plouffe. "On Iraq, he has been very clear," Plouffe said in March 2008. "He offered a withdrawal plan well over a year ago. It's essential to his candidacy and a rock-solid commitment. ... It will be 16 months at the most where you can withdraw combat troops." Plouffe's statement appears to be the best evidence to support the McCain campaign's argument. Plouffe was responding to comments from former Obama adviser Samantha Power, who had said the 16-month timeframe was a "best-case scenario" that Obama wouldn't necessarily follow once he was in office. Power was forced to resign after calling Sen. Hillary Clinton a "monster." But does this mean a 16-month clock starts ticking the moment Obama enters office? We could not find a direct statement from Obama saying that, and found statements he made throughout the campaign that contradicted that. For example: • At a Democratic debate in Hanover, N.H., on Sept. 26, 2007, the late Tim Russert pressed Obama as to whether he would have all troops out by the end of his first term. "I think it's hard to project four years from now, and I think it would be irresponsible. We don't know what contingency will be out there," Obama said. "I will drastically reduce our presence there to the mission of protecting our embassy, protecting our civilians and making sure that we're carrying out counterterrorism activities there. I believe that we should have all our troops out by 2013, but I don't want to make promises not knowing what the situation's going to be three or four years out." • At a Democratic debate in Cleveland on Feb. 26, 2008, Obama said, "As soon as I take office, I will call in the Joint Chiefs of Staff, we will initiate a phased withdrawal, we will be as careful getting out as we were careless getting in. We will give ample time for them to stand up, to negotiate the kinds of agreements that will arrive at the political accommodations that are needed." • At a debate in Philadelphia on April 16, 2008, Obama said, "Now, I will always listen to our commanders on the ground with respect to tactics. Once I've given them a new mission, that we are going to proceed deliberately in an orderly fashion out of Iraq and we are going to have our combat troops out, we will not have permanent bases there, once I've provided that mission, if they come to me and want to adjust tactics, then I will certainly take their recommendations into consideration; but ultimately the buck stops with me as the commander in chief." • On Meet the Press on May 4, 2008, Russert asked Obama what he would do if advisers thought "a quick withdrawal" from Iraq would result in genocide. Obama replied, "Of course, I would factor in the possibilities of genocide, and I factored it in when I said that I would begin a phased withdrawal. What we have talked about is a very deliberate and prudent approach to the withdrawal — one to two brigades per month. At that pace, it would take about 16 months, assuming that George Bush is not going to lower troop levels before the next president takes office. We are talking about, potentially, two years away. At that point, we will have been in Iraq seven years. If we cannot get the Iraqis to stand up in seven years, we're not going to get them to stand up in 14 or 28 or 56 years." Taken in their entirety, Obama's comments reflect a philosophy of "about 16 months" for withdrawal. He also appears to be willing to take advice from commanders on the ground that might affect the general pace, but not the overall goal of withdrawal. Yet Obama has been artful in his rhetoric. His campaign has clearly emphasized "16 months" when speaking to antiwar audiences and " about 16 months" when answering questions from withdrawal skeptics. But Obama never urged a "precipitous" withdrawal; even a bill he offered in January 2007 that set a deadline for getting out of Iraq contained an exemption for national security. The Plouffe statement, however, stands out. Plouffe said the 16-month time frame was a "rock-solid commitment." But it's the only statement we found that supports the idea of withdrawal with no allowances made for circumstances on the ground. After the McCain campaign attacked Obama as a flip-flopper, the candidate responded with another news conference the same day. "I intend to end this war," Obama said. "My first day in office I will bring the Joint Chiefs of Staff in, and I will give them a new mission. And that is to end this war. Responsibly, deliberately, but decisively. And I have seen no information that contradicts the notion that we can bring our troops out safely at a pace of one to two brigades per month. And again, that pace translates into having our combat troops out in 16 months' time." Weighing all these statements together, we find the McCain campaign and Let Freedom Ring are off-base in saying Obama has changed position. Obama repeatedly said facts on the ground could affect the tactical moves of an overall withdrawal. Obama's position was not an ironclad withdrawal timeline in the first place. We find the charge that Obama has reversed position to be False.	None	Let Freedom Ring	None	None	None	2008-07-24T00:00:00	2008-07-24	['Iraq']

pomt-00670	"The families that are covered through the Low Income Pool is a different group of individuals than are covered by Obamacare."	mostly false	/florida/statements/2015/may/11/rick-scott/patients-who-use-lip-are-different-medicaid-expans/	Washington may favor expanding Medicaid, Gov. Rick Scott argues, but it won’t help the people being served by the soon-to-expire Low Income Pool, called LIP. Speaking to reporters, Scott said he doesn’t share the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services’ position that growing Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act is a better solution than renewing the current LIP fund. The LIP program, which mostly helps cover hospital costs for uninsured and underinsured patient visits, is set to expire June 30. "The families that are covered through the Low Income Pool is a different group of individuals than are covered by Obamacare," Scott said. Given the context, we’re taking "Obamacare" to mean Medicaid expansion; we contacted Scott’s office, but they didn’t elaborate. One of the chief arguments for Medicaid expansion is that it would cover uninsured Floridians, many of whom receive care at hospitals and clinics that then turn to the LIP program to offset costs. We decided to check if Scott was right about those being two different sets of potential patients. LIP vs. Medicaid The debate over Medicaid expansion and the loss of federal matching money for the $2.2 billion LIP fund has roiled the state Legislature this year. While the Senate wants a Medicaid expansion based on private insurance, the House refuses. Adding fuel to the fire is that Washington in 2014 said it would not renew the LIP, a temporary program funded since 2005 by both state and federal taxes. That led to a billion-dollar hole in the budget and a standoff that requires a special session in June. One of the primary arguments for expansion has been that more than 800,000 Floridians would be covered under a broader Medicaid program. The Affordable Care Act allows Florida to cover all adults with incomes below 138 percent of federal poverty level. (100 percent is currently $11,770 for an individual and $24,250 for a family of four). The pro-expansion side points out this means the hundreds of thousands of newly eligible Floridians would be able to enroll in Medicaid and have access to the physicians and preventive care it offers. Advocates say this would preclude the need for LIP money, as most of the uninsured who typically turn to emergency room visits for care would then be insured. But just because you are uninsured doesn’t necessarily mean you are poor enough to qualify for an expanded Medicaid. The LIP fund helps reimburse care providers for services rendered instead of directly covering patients. That means it pays for anyone who is uninsured, whether they would qualify for Medicaid or not. Experts told us those who don’t qualify for Medicaid would include undocumented immigrants and people above 138 percent of the federal poverty level without insurance. But that second group at least enjoys the benefit of being able to get subsidized policies if their incomes are less than 400 percent of the federal poverty level. Even if they don’t choose to enroll in one of those policies, the option exists. It’s also not right to say that potential Medicaid beneficiaries and those helped by LIP are mutually exclusive groups, as Scott makes it sound. Chances are that most of the uninsured making these uncompensated ER visits are the poorest patients, Harvard health policy professor Ben Sommers told us. "Technically yes, some portion of the people potentially served by the LIP would not be identical to the people covered by the ACA (Affordable Care Act)," he said. "But in broad strokes, the main people who benefit from the LIP would benefit even more from the Medicaid expansion and ACA Marketplace coverage." Florida has the second-highest total of low-income, uninsured adults in the nation behind Texas, so insuring them through Medicaid would mean hospitals would get paid for their services, those analysts said. It’s much more effective than attempting to pay emergency bills after the fact. "If you have insurance you may know that you can get preventive care like vaccinations, mammograms or primary care," said Leighton Ku, director of the Center for Health Policy Research at George Washington University. "If there is only uncompensated care, more people are likely to skip preventive and primary care because they will worry about the cost ... and only get care when they are quite sick and need emergency or hospital care." Our ruling Scott said, "The families that are covered through the Low Income Pool is a different group of individuals than are covered by Obamacare." This makes it sound as if the people who would qualify for Medicaid under an expansion are completely different than patients who leave hospitals with unpaid bills the LIP fund helps pay to providers. Health policy experts said that while there would still be uninsured people not paying their bills under an expansion, plenty of overlap exists between the two, especially at lower incomes.

pomt-03619	"We are dealing with an administration that, quite frankly, has shown a reluctance to enforce the immigration law."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2013/may/07/marco-rubio/marco-rubio-says-obama-shows-reluctance-enforc/	Republican Sen. Marco Rubio is taking a precarious lead on immigration reform within his party, where the vocal conservative wing is wary of any hint of amnesty for people living in the U.S. illegally. Rubio is framing his case, in part, by reminding Republicans that they don’t want President Barack Obama leading the way on this issue. "We are dealing with 11 million people, but we are also dealing with the future of immigration in this country, and we are dealing with an administration that, quite frankly, has shown a reluctance to enforce the immigration law," Rubio told Fox News’ Greta Van Susteren on April 30, 2013. "Look, if you want to know the single impediment to get things done ... people don't believe the Obama administration or the federal government will enforce the law." As Rubio continues barnstorming for immigration reform, the claim that Obama has gone soft on enforcement has become part of his script. Is it true? We reached out to Rubio’s spokesman, Alex Conant, the White House and other experts to evaluate Obama's record on enforcing immigration law. First, we'll examine points from Obama's critics, evidence that they say shows he is reluctant to enforce immigration law. Then we'll look at the other side, at evidence that some say shows Obama has vigorously enforced immigration law. Where enforcement has decreased Prosecutorial discretion on deportations. Conant pointed us to the criticism that the Obama administration is choosing not to deport millions of known illegal immigrants. In 2011, the administration announced a policy of making deportation of criminals (think violent offenders, gang members and drug traffickers) who are in the U.S. illegally a top priority. Those with no criminal record or threat to public safety became a low priority and would likely be allowed to remain in the U.S. These positions are enshrined in the "Morton memos," directives from U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement Director John Morton issued in June 2011. "ICE … has limited resources to remove those illegally in the United States. ICE must prioritize the use of its enforcement personnel, detention space and removal assets to ensure that the aliens it removes represent, as much as reasonably possible, the agency's enforcement priorities, namely the promotion of national security, border security, public safety, and the integrity of the immigration system," Morton wrote. That meant that family members, students and other longtime resident immigrants would not be targeted. Deferred action on immigrants brought as children. Conant also cited Obama’s actions on immigrants who were brought to the United States illegally as children, commonly called "Dreamers." In June 2012, Obama announced that his administration would no longer deport young undocumented immigrants if they met certain criteria, including having entered the United States as children, having a clean criminal record and attending school. Prosecutorial discretion and deferred action no doubt mean that certain segments of immigrants are not being eyed for deportation. But David Martin, an international law professor at the University of Virginia School of Law, argued that doesn’t add up to a reluctance to enforce the law. He said it’s "choosing different things to enforce." "There’s been an effort since very early to be more serious and more systematic about the priorities," Martin said. "In my view that’s a perfectly appropriately way to operate a law enforcement agency. I see it as more sensible enforcement." Position on "border triggers." Many Republicans, including Rubio, want immigration reform to include a "trigger" that says the border will be secure before immigrants can begin the path toward legal status or citizenship. The Obama administration opposes such a trigger. "I think that once people really look at the whole system and how it works, relying on one thing as a so-called trigger is not the way to go," Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano said in March 2013. "There needs to be certainty in the bill so that people know when they can legalize and then when the pathway to citizenship, earned citizenship, would open up." A border trigger, however, is a mechanism of proposed law -- not something currently in place that the Obama administration is declining to enforce. A lawsuit against Arizona. Is Obama not only shying from enforcement, but also going after states that are getting tough? Conant noted the Justice Department’s 2010 lawsuit against the state of Arizona over its controversial immigration law that grants local police greater authority to check the legal status of people they stop. The law was meant to "discourage and deter" illegal immigrants from staying in the state. Federal officials said Arizona’s law would flood them with cases of illegal immigrants who pose no danger. But the federal government’s lawsuit is a constitutional issue more than an enforcement one. "They went after Arizona on a constitutional principle that the federal government is in charge of immigration and it’s the federal government that should be making immigration laws, not Arizona," said Stephen Yale-Loehr, an immigration attorney and adjunct professor at Cornell Law School. No more 287(g) program. Jessica Zuckerman, a homeland security analyst for the conservative Heritage Foundation, said the Obama administration has "all but abolished" a program that allows state and local law enforcement to essentially be deputized as immigration agents and be allowed to arrest people for immigration issues. It’s known as 287(g). "That program’s been undercut basically to the point that it doesn’t exist anymore," Zuckerman said. Indeed, this 2012 announcement from Immigration and Customs Enforcement, or ICE, says exactly that. "ICE has also decided not to renew any of its agreements with state and local law enforcement agencies that operate task forces under the 287(g) program. ICE has concluded that other enforcement programs... are a more efficient use of resources for focusing on priority cases," the announcement said. Fewer workplace raids. Zuckerman also said far fewer random searches are occurring at workplaces where illegal immigrants are suspected to be employed. Large-scale workplace arrests of illegal workers were hallmarks of the George W. Bush administration's approach, and in 2011 arrests from worksite raids had dropped by 70 percent since Bush left office. That too reflected Obama’s contrasting priorities, as ICE officials turned their attention to employers. If immigration inspectors found evidence that immigrant workers’ identity documents might be false, managers had to dismiss the workers or risk prosecution. But Zuckerman argues that document audits don’t equal enforcement. "It needs to be part of other enforcement measures that have decreased," she said. "None of them alone is a silver bullet." Where enforcement has increased Experts also told us that Obama has ramped up enforcement on some avenues of immigration law. "Secure Communities." While backing away from the 287(g) program, the Obama administration put renewed emphasis on the Secure Communities program which is meant to identify "dangerous criminal aliens" for deportation. Local law enforcement agencies send criminal suspects’ fingerprints to be checked in national crime databases. If an arrestee turns out to be an illegal immigrant with a serious rap sheet, the person can be taken into federal custody. Alex Nowrasteh, an immigration policy analyst with the libertarian Cato Institute, said the program was used in about 3 percent of U.S. jurisdictions when Obama took office and is in about 97 percent today. Secure Communities, he said, "is the most effective immigration enforcement tool to date as it conscripts local law enforcement into enforcing federal immigration laws. Zuckerman, however, noted that "it only focuses on criminal aliens and not the broader issue." Deportations are up. It has been widely reported that overall deportations of illegal immigrants have increased during Obama’s term. ICE deported 409,949 immigrants in the 2012 fiscal year, up from 396,096 immigrants in FY 2011 and more than 392,000 immigrants in FY 2010. Those figures all show a steady increase over every year of the Bush administration. This chart from the pro-immigrant group America’s Voice shows year-to-year figures. Those numbers, however, are disputed by critics who note that deportations at the border are up, while other types -- such as those from the defunct 287(g) program -- have dropped off. "They’re doing a different kind of enforcement that results in higher numbers, but there are definitely not more people being removed from the interior of the country," Jessica Vaughan, director of policy studies at the Center for Immigration Studies which favors lower immigration levels, told the Washington Times recently. At PolitiFact, we have also noted that personnel and other resources to stop illegal crossings at the U.S.-Mexico border have increased dramatically in recent years. The number of border patrol officers more than doubled from about 10,000 to about 21,000 between 2004 and 2012. Employer prosecutions. As we noted above, while fewer workplace raids are happening, the Obama administration is focusing more on prosecutions against employers and doing more audits of workers’ documentation paperwork to ensure immigration compliance. In 2011, the New York Times reported that ICE started 2,746 workplace investigations, more than double the number in 2008. Fines totaling a record $43 million were levied on companies in immigration cases. Our ruling Rubio said the Obama administration "has shown a reluctance to enforce the immigration law." His spokesman pointed out some concrete changes in how Obama has approached immigration, namely a program to allow people brought here illegally as children to seek deferred action on deportation and an emphasis on deporting criminals while leaving many illegal residents who are otherwise law abiders alone. But while Rubio calls that reluctance, others see it as prioritizing. Obama has put new emphasis on some approaches, such as adding border agents, while minimizing others, such as the 287(g) program. Whether those priorities represent sound policy is a matter of opinion. But Rubio’s statement suggests that Obama has turned his back on enforcing the law, and the reality is much more nuanced than that. We rate the statement Half True.

pomt-00231	"Only Duterte’s Philippines and Trump’s United States of America have money bail."	mostly true	/california/statements/2018/oct/09/gavin-newsom/are-us-philippines-only-two-countries-money-bail/	Democrat Gavin Newsom touted a new state law that ends monetary bail during the Oct. 8 California gubernatorial debate. The bill, which outgoing Democratic Gov. Jerry Brown signed in August, emerged after years of complaints that the money bail system is punitive for low-income Americans, in some cases making those who cannot afford their share of the bail wait for months behind bars for minor violations or for crimes they are ultimately cleared of. Instead, the bill would enact a system of "risk assessments" that sets out non-monetary conditions for release. (As is the case currently, the highest-risk arrestees would be remanded into custody without bail.) To Newsom, the law is a first step toward correcting a national blemish. Referring to President Donald Trump and Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte, Newsom said, "Only Duterte’s Philippines and Trump’s United States of America have money bail. California became the first state to step up and step into this debate and do the right thing." When we looked into Newsom’s assertion, we found that he was largely correct, though with some caveats required. The focus on the United States and the Philippines as outliers internationally in bail policy dates back to at least 1991, when a University of Southern Mississippi professor, F.E. Devine, wrote a study titled, "Commercial Bail Bonding: A Comparison of Common Law Alternatives." (Devine died in 2011.) Referring to commercial bail bond companies, Devine wrote that "with the exception of the Philippines and an ambiguous provision in Liberia, which does not seem to result in any important commercialization of bail, these companies do not exist outside of the United States." He continued, "The Philippines exhibits the only bail system outside the United States dominated by commercial provision of bail." Three experts with a specialty in bail bonds said that Devine’s singling out of the two countries still stands, though they added that Newsom could have been more careful in his wording. Other countries do require monetary deposit for pretrial release in at least some cases, said Megan Stevenson, an assistant professor of law at George Mason University. "For instance, I know cash bail is sometimes used in Canada," though its use is much more limited, Stevenson said. A more accurate way to phrase it, she said, would be to say that "only the U.S. and Philippines have a cash bail system that is dominated by commercial bail bondsmen." This makes a difference because a commercial bail industry has a financial stake in the system. Shima Baradaran Baughman, a law professor at the University of Utah, said that she referred to the same two countries as outliers in her 2017 volume, "The Bail Book." Asked whether she agreed with Stevenson’s clarification about commercial bail bonding companies being the important distinction, she said she did. Tim Schnacke, executive director of the Colorado-based Center for Legal and Evidence-Based Practices, agreed. "I've tried to correct people when they say it the way (Newsom said it) but it just keeps finding legs," Schnacke said. The other asterisk we would place on Newsom’s assertion is his invocation of Trump and Duterte. As Devine’s book makes clear, the cash bail policies of the United States and the Philippines predated the Trump and Duterte presidencies by decades. Our ruling Newsom said, "Only Duterte’s Philippines and and Trump’s United States of America have money bail." These two countries are international outliers on bail policy, but Newsom would have been more accurate if he’d specified the role of commercial bail providers, rather than "money bail" more generally. In addition, his references to Trump and Duterte are gratuitous, since the policies were well-established for decades before they took office. We rate the statement Mostly True.

pomt-04220	Operating a health care exchange would be "illegal" in Georgia and some states because of legislation passed in those states.	false	/georgia/statements/2012/nov/28/michael-cannon/experts-say-federal-law-trumps-state-law-obamacare/	Georgians who oppose Obamacare can rest a little easier. According to one health care expert, they don’t have to worry about one particular element of what’s officially known as the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. Three days after the presidential election, Michael Cannon, the director of health policy studies for the Cato Institute, wrote an article in the National Review saying that states are under no obligation to create health care exchanges. He then wrote a claim we hadn’t heard before. "[O]perating an Obamacare exchange would be illegal in 14 states," he wrote. "Alabama, Arizona, Georgia, Idaho, Indiana, Kansas, Louisiana, Missouri, Montana, Ohio, Oklahoma, Tennessee, Utah, and Virginia have enacted either statutes or constitutional amendments (or both) forbidding state employees to participate in an essential exchange function: implementing Obamacare’s individual and employer mandates." Is that correct? PolitiFact Georgia decided to conduct an examination of the claim. Cannon told an Atlanta Journal-Constitution health reporter via email that he based his statement on Senate Bill 411, passed by the Georgia Legislature in 2010 and signed into law by then-Gov. Sonny Perdue. Cannon cited this particular portion of the bill: "To preserve the freedom of citizens of this state to provide for their health care: No law or rule or regulation shall compel, directly or indirectly, any person, employer, or health care provider to participate in any health care system." Cannon declined via email to comment for our fact check, saying he’s continuing his boycott against the PolitiFact franchise. He ended his email with a Latin phrase Cannon has used in other articles, Tyrannis delenda est., which means "tyranny must be destroyed." The Washington-based Cato Institute advocates for limited government intervention on social and business matters. The federal health care law, passed in March 2010, gives states the opportunity to organize health care exchanges where consumers and small businesses will be able to compare the quality and prices of health plans. If states won’t create an exchange, the federal government will do it. Gov. Nathan Deal announced Nov. 16 that he would not set up an exchange under the health care law. Most conservatives and libertarians were livid about the provision in the federal health care law known as the "individual mandate," which requires Americans to buy health insurance and the majority of employers to provide it. Twenty-six states, including Georgia, filed a lawsuit to overturn the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act shortly after President Barack Obama signed it into law in March 2010. Georgia SB 411 was an attempt to counter the federal law. Senate Republicans pushed for the legislation after Democrats refused to support a similar amendment to the Georgia Constitution. Perdue signed the bill in June 2010. PolitiFact Georgia has delved into this topic before. In 2010, Sen. Judson Hill, a Marietta Republican, sent a mailer to potential voters in his district saying he had "stood up to Barack Obama by passing legislation that prevents you from being forced to join government health plans or buy health insurance against your will." Hill was referring to SB 411. PolitiFact Georgia found experts who noted that the state action would have little impact because the federal government has "extremely broad" power to provide incentives and disincentives through the tax code. With those caveats, and the uncertainty over the federal health care law’s future, Hill’s claim was rated Half True. In June, the U.S. Supreme Court upheld the health care law in a 5-4 ruling. Chief Justice John Roberts wrote that the individual mandate may "reasonably" be characterized as a tax. A spokeswoman for Georgia Attorney General Sam Olens, a vocal critic of the federal law, said his office does not generally speak on state law when Olens is not directly engaged in the issue. Bill Custer, director of Georgia State University’s Center for Health Services Research, qualified in his comments to us that he’s not an attorney, but he believes the federal health care law overrides any state legislation. "My understanding is that there is no compulsion in any part of the law now (that was what the Supreme Court ruled this summer) so the state law is moot and in any case federal law supersedes state law on this issue," Custer said via email. Other nonpartisan experts we contacted agreed. "Federal law trumps state law," said Russ Toal, director of the Office of Public Health Practice/Community Service at Georgia Southern University. "I don’t think (Cannon’s claim) is accurate." Kathleen Burch, an associate professor at Atlanta’s John Marshall Law School, said the state law doesn’t prohibit the creation of an exchange. Burch, who specializes in constitutional law, also cited the U.S. Constitution’s supremacy clause, which gives the federal law authority over inconsistent state exercise of power. To sum up, Cannon wrote that creating a health care exchange under the 2010 federal health care law would be "illegal" in Georgia and 13 other states. He wrote that those states have legislation that precludes "implementing Obamacare’s individual and employer mandates." The U.S. Supreme Court ruled that the individual mandate was allowable under the Constitution. The experts we spoke to and others note federal law supersedes state law here. We rate this claim False.

pomt-13151	"Jack Berry voted for a plan to cut $23.8 million from our schools."	mostly false	/virginia/statements/2016/oct/31/levar-stoney/levar-stoney-weakly-claims-jack-berry-voted-cut-23/	There’s a photo of a sad-looking girl sitting at a school desk on a new flier being circulated by Richmond mayoral candidate Levar Stoney. "Jack Berry voted for a plan to cut $23.8 million from our public schools," the handbill states in capital letters. Berry also is among the seven candidates in the mayor’s race. He’s held a number of key administrative posts in the Richmond region but never has held elective office. So we wondered if he had, indeed, voted to cut millions from city schools, as Stoney said. Footnotes on Stoney’s flier base the claim on an April 17, 2012, article in the Richmond Times-Dispatch that updated a funding feud between Mayor Dwight C. Jones and the city’s School Board. The controversy began in February 2012, when the board passed a school budget with $263.7 million in projected expenses but only $239.9 million in projected revenues. Rather than cut expenses, the board opted to approve its underfunded budget and ask Jones and the Richmond City Council to make up the difference. Jones responded in March by appointing a task force of 11 public and private executives to look for savings in the School Board’s budget that wouldn’t hurt classroom instruction. Berry, a former Richmond budget director, was one of the appointees. The panel hired two outside consultants, including former Richmond City Manager Robert C. Bobb, to find possible short- and long-term cuts. The consultants’ $35,000 fee was paid by the Greater Richmond Chamber Foundation. On April 16, 2012, the panel voted 10-1 to recommend $23.8 million in cuts to the School Board’s proposed budget. Berry voted with the majority. An article in the next day’s Times-Dispatch - footnoted in Stoney’s flier - said the task force "leaned heavily" on the consultant’s recommendations in finalizing its list of proposed cuts. The list included: •cutting 20 teacher positions; •cutting 25 teacher aides; •cutting 50 non-teacher positions; •imposing three furlough days; •changing various health care benefits; •changing the structure of plant service and security; and •eliminating the employee bonus pool. Stoney’s flier calls the package of cuts "Berry’s plan," but there’s nothing in The Times-Dispatch’s coverage that suggests he was the mastermind. To the contrary, the article cited by Stoney says the task force "heavily leaned" on the recommendations of its consultants in finalizing its list of proposed cuts. It also should be noted that Berry was not one of the two people Jones appointed as co-chairmen of the panel. A week later, Jones asked City Council to contribute an additional $5.1 million for education - far below the extra $23.8 million the School Board sought. The mayor rejected the task force’s recommendations for furlough days and eliminating health benefits for the school system’s pre-Medicare retirees. The council increased that amount to $5.6 million. In the end, Richmond schools were left with a $250 million budget for the 2012-13 school year, anchored by a $129.4 million appropriation from the City Council and with the rest coming from state and federal sources. That was slightly higher than the $249.1 million for the 2011-12 school year, which included $123.8 million in city funds. Our ruling Stoney’s flier says, "Jack Berry voted for a plan to cut $23.8 million from our schools." The Richmond School Board passed a budget in 2012 that exceeded its revenues by $23.8 million and asked the city to make up the difference. Mayor Jones refused and appointed an 11-member advisory committee, which included Berry, to find savings. The panel voted 10-1, with Berry’s support, to recommend a plan that itemized $23.8 million in cuts to the board’s proposed budget. The City Council largely adopted that plan. Stoney’s statement suggests that Berry had an official role in the budget deliberations. He didn’t. Berry served as an adviser to the mayor with instructions to find efficiencies. He didn’t have a say in the actual appropriation of city funds for education; that remained in the hands of the City Council. It’s also misleading to say, as Stoney does, that the plan "cut" $23.8 million from schools. Most of that sum was hoped-for new money from the City Council that the School Board never received. So Stoney’s statement contains an element of truth but ignores important facts that would give a different impression. We rate it Mostly False.https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/23f24b7a-2d34-4c7d-9f00-81e65e12263b	None	Levar Stoney	None	None	None	2016-10-31T12:16:49	2016-10-17	['None']
pomt-09413	A national poll found that among people who oppose the Democratic health care reform bill, "almost 40 percent" opposed it not because it goes too far, but because "they don’t think it goes far enough. ... They will not be unhappy when we pass health care reform."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/mar/19/john-yarmuth/yarmuth-40-percent-health-care-bill-opponents-say-/	Republicans have repeatedly made the case that the public believes the Democratic health care bill goes too far in restructuring the American health system. But on March 16, 2010, Rep. John Yarmuth, a Democrat from Kentucky, sought to remind the public that a lot of Americans don't think the bill goes far enough. "Madam Speaker," Yarmuth said in a House floor speech, "every time I hear a Republican talking about health care reform, they say the American people don’t want it. They say it so much that I think they’re beginning to try to convince themselves that it’s true. But there’s a national poll that shows what the real story is. They asked, of all the people who are opposed to health care or say they are, how many are opposed to it because they don’t think it goes far enough. Forty percent. Almost 40 percent said that was the reason. They will not be unhappy when we pass health care reform." Given a steady stream of polls showing a plurality or even a majority of Americans saying the bill goes too far, Yarmuth's number struck us as surprisingly high. So we decided to look into it. We asked Yarmuth's office which poll they were referring to. They said it was a poll conducted for McClatchy newspapers by Ipsos Public Affairs -- a credible firm that works with a variety of media outlets -- between Feb. 26 and Feb. 28, 2010. The poll asked 1,076 voters a series of questions about health care and other issues and had a margin of error of plus or minus 3 points. Specifically, it asked the following: "You said you are opposed to the health care reform proposals presently being discussed. Is that because you favor health care reform overall but think the current proposals don't go far enough to reform health care, or you oppose health care reform overall and think the current proposals go too far in reforming health care?" All told, 37 percent of voters said that the current proposals "don't go far enough to reform health care" -- close enough, in our view, to make Yarmuth's "almost 40 percent" reference accurate. On the strategic level, Yarmuth may have a point that the invisibility of the doesn't-go-far-enough crowd in the public opinion wars may have hampered the proreform camp's cause. "There is reasonable evidence that the current bill looks weaker in public opinion polls because some 10 percent to 20 percent of the public say 'opposed' when they mean that they want more progressive, further-reaching reform," said Charles Franklin, a polling expert at the University of Wisconsin. Given the intense media focus on how well the Democratic plan polls, Franklin said, "the irony is that progressives have made health care reform less likely to pass by [telling pollsters] they oppose this bill." But while Yarmuth, in his basic analysis, got his facts right, it's also worth making a few cautionary points. • Even at nearly 40 percent, it's still a minority view among those who oppose the bill. The February Ipsos poll found that 54 percent -- a clear majority -- of those opposed to the health care bill said the bill went too far. (Another 10 percent said they opposed the bill but couldn't explain why.) • An earlier survey by the same pollster showed softer support for "doesn't go far enough." Ipsos asked the same question during a survey taken for McClatchy between Nov. 19 and Nov. 22, 2009. In that poll, 25 percent said they opposed the bill because it doesn't go far enough -- quite a bit lower than the 37 percent who said so three months later. In the earlier poll, 66 percent said they opposed it because it went too far, and 9 percent couldn't explain why they were opposed. • Most importantly, it's not necessarily clear what voters mean when they say the bill "doesn't go far enough." It could mean that the respondent prefers that the bill include the public option -- a more liberal idea that didn't make its way into the final measure -- or it could mean they think it doesn't go far enough in advancing conservative ideas like health savings accounts or medical malpractice reform. As Megan McArdle, a blogger for TheAtlantic.com, wrote in December, "I could go down to [the libertarian Cato Institute] right now and poll 65 percent support for the proposition that the health care reform doesn't go far enough -- in the direction of taking away the employer health care tax exemption, means testing Medicare, and other ideas that no one would call 'left.' " These variations became evident in a CBS News poll taken between Jan. 6-10, 2010. On three distinct issues, poll-takers asked all respondents whether the bill "goes too far," "doesn't go far enough," or is "about right." On how the bill handled providing health insurance "to as many Americans as possible" -- a factor of special interest to liberals -- "doesn't go far enough" edged "goes too far" by a slim 35 percent-32 percent margin. On how the bill handled controlling costs -- an issue favored by fiscal conservatives -- "doesn't go far enough" outpaced "goes too far" by a 39 percent-24 percent margin. And on regulating the health insurance industry, "doesn't go far enough" walloped "goes too far" by a 43 percent-27 percent margin. Trying to meld all these divergent strains into a single, reliable polling question is virtually impossible. Indeed, a look at the data makes clear a bedrock belief of pollsters -- that the framing and the precise wording of a question can make a huge difference in the results. Back to Yarmuth's claim. To his credit, he accurately cited a result from a legitimate poll. However, due to variations in wording and the complexity of polling this issue, there's quite a bit of uncertainty about what that result actually means. It does not conclusively demonstrate that, as Yarmuth put it, nearly 40 percent of voters "will not be unhappy when we pass health care reform." Some of those voters likely believe that the bill should have gone further in a conservative direction, not a liberal one, and they are unlikely to be happy if a Democratic bill passes. So we rate his statement Half True.	None	John Yarmuth	None	None	None	2010-03-19T10:34:44	2010-03-16	['Democratic_Party_(United_States)']
pomt-06147	In a watershed 1958 decision, "the Warren court asserted by itself that the Supreme Court was supreme over the president and the Congress."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/dec/20/newt-gingrich/newt-gingrich-says-supreme-court-crossed-major-thr/	During the Dec. 18, 2011, edition of CBS’ Face the Nation, Republican presidential candidate Newt Gingrich had an extended and often pointed conversation with host Bob Schieffer about his views on how the judiciary relates to the other branches of government. In the interview, Gingrich explained his position that judges, at least in some circumstances, should be called to account for their decisions that flout the public will, either by being brought before Congress or in some cases by being removed from office. In the days before the interview, Gingrich had been pointing voters to a paper he had written about the issue. In the paper, Gingrich suggested a number of options for reining in the judiciary, including "judicial accountability hearings" before Congress, impeachment of judges, defunding or eliminating lower courts and changing how law schools teach the issue of judicial checks and balances Such ideas drew criticism from legal observers, including two former attorneys general who served under President George W. Bush. Fox News reported that Michael Mukasey said that some of the ideas are "dangerous, ridiculous, totally irresponsible, outrageous, off-the-wall and would reduce the entire judicial system to a spectacle." Alberto Gonzales said that the country’s greatness is "built upon the foundation of the rule of law. And one of the things that makes it great and (ensures that) the rule of law is protected by having a strong independent judiciary." But on Face the Nation, Gingrich doubled down. He told Schieffer, "You have this real problem that since 1958, when the Warren court asserted by itself that the Supreme Court was supreme over the president and the Congress, you've had a fundamental assault on our liberties by the courts. You have an increasingly arrogant judiciary. And the question is, is there anything we the American people can do? Well, the standard conservative answer has been, well, eventually we'll appoint good judges. I think that's inadequate." We decided to look at his claim that in 1958, "the Warren court asserted by itself that the Supreme Court was supreme over the president and the Congress." It’s one of the linchpins of Gingrich’s ideas on the judiciary, one he cited both in the Face the Nation interview and in the paper he wrote. Cooper vs. Aaron The 1958 case in question is Cooper vs. Aaron, which grew out of opposition by the Arkansas state government to school desegregation ordered by the Supreme Court in the landmark case Brown vs. Board of Education. In its unanimous ruling, the Supreme Court wrote that "this Court cannot countenance a claim by the Governor and Legislature of a State that there is no duty on state officials to obey federal court orders resting on this Court's considered interpretation of the United States Constitution in Brown vs. Board of Education." In his paper, Gingrich places special emphasis on the role of Cooper vs. Aaron in shaping how the judiciary operates today, calling it a "power grab" that is "a modern phenomenon and a dramatic break from all previous American history." Here’s a portion of his argument: "If the Supreme Court ruled that two plus two equal five, would the executive and legislative branches have to agree? Would we have to pass a Constitutional amendment to overrule the Court and reassert that two plus two equals four? "In 1958, all nine sitting justices of the Supreme Court signed on to a judicial opinion in the case Cooper vs. Aaron that asserted that the Supreme Court’s interpretation of the Constitution was supreme in importance to the constitutional interpretation of the other two branches of government, and that this judicial supremacy, all nine justices asserted, is a ‘permanent and indispensable feature of our constitutional system.’ "The Supreme Court assertions in Cooper vs. Aaron are factually and historically false. Nevertheless, following Cooper vs. Aaron, the executive and legislative branches have largely acted as if the Constitution empowered the Supreme Court with final decision making authority about the meaning of the Constitution. The executive and legislative branches have further behaved as if they have no choice but to give total deference to Supreme Court decisions, even if the executive and/or legislative branch believes the Supreme Court has seriously erred in its constitutional judgments." Legal experts we spoke to agreed that Cooper vs. Aaron was, and remains, an important case on the question of judicial power. But many of the same experts added that Gingrich has exaggerated the case’s significance and meaning. We see two significant problems with how Gingrich used the example of Cooper vs. Aaron. Gingrich’s focus on Cooper vs. Aaron wrongly ignores earlier legal precedents Cooper vs. Aaron did not assert "by itself" the primacy of the Supreme Court, as Gingrich said. It may have offered an especially clear and forceful distillation of that principle, but the view did not emerge suddenly from the minds of the 1958 court led by Chief Justice Earl Warren -- a jurist, not coincidentally, who was unloved by many conservatives on ideological grounds. The notion that the Supreme Court can overrule the other branches of government dates back to the landmark case of Marbury vs. Madison in 1803. "It is emphatically the province and duty of the judicial department to say what the law is," wrote the justices, led by Chief Justice John Marshall. "Those who apply the rule to particular cases, must of necessity expound and interpret that rule. If two laws conflict with each other, the courts must decide on the operation of each. … This is of the very essence of judicial duty." The ruling goes on to state that "the judicial power of the United States is extended to all cases arising under the constitution," and it backs the "principle, supposed to be essential to all written constitutions, that a law repugnant to the constitution is void, and that courts, as well as other departments, are bound by that instrument." Kermit Roosevelt, a University of Pennsylvania law professor, said that "Cooper vs. Aaron is usually taken as the canonical case for judicial supremacy, so it’s not inappropriate to refer to it in this context. But Gingrich is stretching the point to suggest that this was a Warren court invention. The idea that the Supreme Court’s judgment about the meaning and requirements of the Constitution takes priority over that of other governmental actors is clearly articulated in Marbury vs. Madison, which Cooper relies on." Jesse Choper, a law professor at the University of California at Berkeley, added that one can cite a whole host of cases prior to 1958 in which the Supreme Court affirmatively blocked actions by both Congress and the president on constitutional grounds. "There’s a zillion of those," Choper said. "All the New Deal cases were about that. And there are certainly cases in which the Supreme Court has held the executive branch unconstitutional." Probably the biggest, he said, was Youngstown Co. vs. Sawyer (1952), in which the court overruled an executive order by President Harry Truman to nationalize steel mills to avert a nationwide strike. Contrary to what Gingrich says, many of the experts said, there was not a bright line between pre-1958 and post-1958 Supreme Court jurisprudence. Gingrich is incorrect if he’s suggesting that "this is new or different than what largely happened during the period prior to 1958," said Roger Pilon, vice president for legal affairs at the libertarian Cato Institute. All of this said, most of our experts agreed that Gingrich isn’t totally off-base about Cooper. Several noted that the decision’s language is especially forceful, perhaps because it came in reaction to the "massive resistance" to desegregation that Brown had sparked. For instance, the justices in Cooper asserted "the basic principle that the federal judiciary is supreme in the exposition of the law of the Constitution, and that principle has ever since been respected by this Court and the Country as a permanent and indispensable feature of our constitutional system." "No matter how you read it, (that is) a big step beyond Marbury," said Vik Amar, a University of California at Davis law professor. "Marbury said that courts have the power and duty to interpret the constitution, and that they have to do so independently. It didn’t say that other branches always had to fall in line with the courts’ interpretations, and it certainly didn’t say other branches have no interpretive role to play." In addition, several experts noted that Gingrich has a point when he details past historical examples of presidents refusing to bend to the Supreme Court in every instance. "Thomas Jefferson and others not only denounced Marbury vs. Madison as wrong but also asserted that the executive and judicial branches had the power to decide for themselves what is the meaning of the Constitution," said legal commentator Stuart Taylor Jr. Finally, there is a longstanding -- though controversial -- strain of thinking that echoes Gingrich’s views. Cooper vs. Aaron has been "highly criticized, not just on the right but also on the left," said Brad Snyder, a law professor at the University of Wisconsin. Then-Attorney General Edwin Meese argued in a high-profile 1986 speech that in Cooper, the court "appeared to arrive at conclusions about its power that would have shocked men like John Marshall. ... Obviously the decision was binding on the parties in the case, but the implication that everyone would have to accept its judgments uncritically, that it was a decision from which there could be no appeal, was astonishing...." Taylor said that the general acquiescence by the president and Congress to the Supreme Court over the course of history comes from pragmatic reasons. "The alternative is that each branch, and, worse, perhaps even the states, would disregard Supreme Court rulings they did not like, moving from a ‘rule of law’ society toward something more chaotic," he said. Cooper vs. Aaron doesn’t explicitly deal with the presidency or Congress at all Despite what Gingrich said on Face the Nation, Cooper vs. Aaron addressed actions of state-government officials, not the president or Congress. "Cooper vs. Aaron was about the supremacy of federal law over the states," said Erwin Chemerinsky, dean the law school at the University of California at Irvine. "It had nothing to do with the Supreme Court relative to Congress and the president. It was about whether Arkansas could disregard a federal court order for desegregation." Roosevelt agreed. "Giving the Supreme Court the last word vis-a-vis state officials is less controversial than giving it the last word vis-a-vis the other branches of the federal government," Roosevelt said. On these grounds, "the claim that Cooper established judicial supremacy over the President and Congress is substantially misleading." Gingrich's larger argument While it's beyond the scope of this fact-check, we do think it's worth noting that almost all the experts we asked had serious problems with Gingrich's proposed policies. "The supremacy of judicial review has served to protect our constitutional rights for over two centuries," said Ronald Rotunda, a law professor at Chapman University. "It was a unanimous decision, signed by each of the nine justices," said Chemerinsky, a leading liberal in legal thinking. "It emphatically says that federal law is supreme and court orders must be complied with. It is hard to imagine a less controversial decision in hindsight." Douglas Kmiec, a Pepperdine University law professor who held top Justice Department posts under Presidents Ronald Reagan and George H.W. Bush, concurred. Gingrich’s solution, Kmiec said, "is to go to war with the basic idea expressed in every civics class by every school child -- namely, judges interpret that which is written down as law, and state executives in administering the interpreted laws can’t reinterpret them, or the whole system falls. … As I see, it Newt's argument has the tendency to wrongly invite citizens to be mad over nothing, or at least nothing he has addressed. This will prompt unknowing citizens to hold courts in the same low regard as they hold Congress itself. It also suggests a mind more inclined to invent trivial, hypothetical problems, which undermines the fragile commitment to the rule of law needed to fairly resolve real cases or controversies." Our ruling In attacking the Supreme Court for its power relative to the other branches of government, it’s understandable that Ginrgich has zeroed in on Cooper vs. Aaron. It is an unusually strong statement of the court’s primacy. But in doing so, Gingrich gets two things wrong, leaving out crucial context. He says the decision claimed that "the Supreme Court was supreme over the president and the Congress," when in fact the decision dealt with the court’s primacy over state officials. Meanwhile, he exaggerates how much of a watershed the 1958 decision was. There was a tradition of judicial review going back to 1803, and the court had repeatedly curtailed both presidential and congressional power in the years between. On balance, we rate his statement Mostly False. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/154167aa-a11c-47e9-973f-f2bb7d90a584	None	Newt Gingrich	None	None	None	2011-12-20T01:01:29	2011-12-18	['United_States_Congress']

pomt-07024	Says U.S. House opponent Michael Williams does not live in and has never voted in the congressional district he’s seeking to represent.	false	/texas/statements/2011/jul/05/roger-williams/roger-williams-says-foe-has-never-voted-congressio/	Newly stumping for a U.S. House seat, Roger Williams told a Weatherford crowd that opponent Michael Williams lacks local grounding. The two Williamses (unrelated) are both Republicans who recently dropped U.S. Senate bids to run in the same newly created North Texas House district. "My opponent does not live in the district," Roger Williams said June 28, according to The Weatherford Democrat. "My opponent has never voted in the district." Not living there? Never voted there? Per the U.S. Constitution, a citizen does not have to live in a congressional district to hold its House seat, though they must be an inhabitant of the same state. If a candidate doesn't live in the district, though, their opponents are likely to point that out. In this episode, Roger Williams was questioning his foe's ties to the 33rd Congressional District just drawn by the Republican-controlled Legislature. Its map of the state’s 36 congressional districts awaits Gov. Rick Perry’s approval. Michael Williams’ campaign disputed Roger Williams’ charge in a June 30 press release. The release says Michael Williams and his wife, Donna, "have owned and claimed a homestead exemption on the same home" in the district since 1995 and, it says, Williams has voted in Arlington many times. In an interview, Will Fullerton, Michael Williams’ campaign manager, told us Williams lived in an Austin condominium while serving on the Texas Railroad Commission, from 1999 to this spring, to satisfy a state constitutional provision requiring statewide elected officials to live in the capital. He said too that Williams has lived in his Arlington home since resigning from the commission as of April 2. Williams was registered to vote in Austin while serving as a commissioner, Fullerton said, though he laid plans to register in Tarrant County after stepping down. We turned next to government sources. According to a clerk with the Tarrant County Appraisal District, Michael and Donna Williams have claimed a homestead exemption on an Arlington residence since 1995. A county elections clerk, Rita Castillo, told us the county fielded a voter registration application from Michael Williams on June 24 and it’s being reviewed by the Texas secretary of state’s office, which oversees elections. Castillo said a state database lists Michael Williams as currently registered to vote in Austin. Responding to our open-records’ request, Tarrant County later provided information indicating that Michael Williams went to the county’s polls 10 times from November 1994 through November 1999. To our inquiry, Roger Williams’ spokesman Colby Hale stressed by email that Michael Williams admits to living in Austin for a decade and to making Austin the "principal location where he votes." He later added that Roger Williams intended to say that for more than a decade, Michael Williams lived, worked and voted in Austin. Far as we can tell, this amended description is about right. However, Michael Williams has also lived in Arlington, where he has claimed a homestead in Arlington for more than 15 years. And contrary to his foe’s published statement, Michael Williams also has voted in the 33rd district and lives there now. All told, the essence of Roger Williams’ statement — that Michael Williams is a carpetbagger — doesn’t hold up. We rate the claim False.

pomt-08785	"In 2008 (Mandel) was re-elected to a second term, representing a district with a 2:1 Democrat to Republican voter ratio."	mostly true	/ohio/statements/2010/aug/20/josh-mandel/republican-josh-mandel-touts-his-electability-comi/	Josh Mandel, a Republican from the left-leaning region of Northeast Ohio, knows the importance of cross-over appeal to winning an election. That’s why Mandel, a state representative running for Ohio treasurer, has been telling voters this year about the overwhelmingly Democratic makeup of his constituency. The message is part of Mandel’s strategy to snatch up some Democratic votes in his bid against incumbent Treasurer Kevin Boyce, a Democrat. "In 2008 (Mandel) was re-elected to a second term, representing a district with a 2:1 Democrat to Republican voter ratio," according to the online biography on Mandel’s campaign website. Mandel, of Lyndhurst, was first elected in 2006 to represent the 17th House District, made up of more than a dozen suburbs in eastern Cuyahoga County. He was re-elected in 2008, securing 72 percent of the vote. Northeast Ohio long has been a region that favors Democrats. But does Mandel's district, which includes some of the wealthier suburbs in Cuyahoga County, lean to the left as much as his online biography suggests? Is his cross-over appeal that strong? Mandel’s campaign cited voter registration statistics recorded at the time of his re-election in November 2008. They showed 38,575 registered Democrats in Mandel’s district compared to 16,449 registered Republicans. "The voter registration of the district is actually over 2-to-1," campaign manager Michael Lord said in an e-mail. "Josh will continue using this number because it’s true and he’s proud to have been elected with a strong mix of Democrats, Republicans and independents." Although Mandel’s math is right, voter registration records usually aren’t the best way to size up an electorate, said Ohio State University political science professor Paul Beck, whose specialties include voting behavior and political parties. "The registration records themselves are not a very good litmus test," Beck said. That’s because the party affiliations only attach when voters participate in primary elections and choose a specific party’s ballot. Those who only vote on issues and do not declare for a party and those who don’t vote in the primary election at all remain classified as independents and would not show up in Mandel’s numbers. And depending on the races in a primary election, voters may switch parties. Consider this scenario: A moderate voter opts to vote in the hotly contested 2008 primary between Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton. Even if that voter had supported Republicans in the past and even if he voted for Republican John McCain in the general election, that voter remains a Democrat on county voting records until opting for Republican ballot in another primary. Beck also noted that voter registration records can be inflated with voters who may have moved away without canceling their registration. Recent election results are a better gauge of a voting population’s tendencies, he said, because they include a larger sample of voters and lack the fundamental flaws of registration statistics. Using recent election results, Mandel’s district has favored Democratic candidates, but by a much slimmer margin than he asserts. The Ohio Manufacturers’ Association studied results of five recent elections for its 2010 Ohio Election Guide. It found that Republicans in the 17th House District tend to receive about 46 percent of the vote. In the 2008 presidential election Mandel's district split nearly evenly between Democrats and Republicans. Obama received 37,350 votes, about 51.5 percent. McCain received 35,207 votes, about 48.5 percent. What all this shows is that depending on which gauge you use, the ratio of Democrats to Republicans can vary significantly. Yet by one measurement, Mandel is correct We rate his statement as Mostly True. Comment on this item.

pomt-06698	"Point Pleasant Beach does not own its beaches; they are privately owned and operated by businesses such as Jenkinson’s"	mostly true	/new-jersey/statements/2011/sep/05/vincent-barrella/point-pleasant-beach-mayor-says-boroughs-beaches-a/	It might seem a given that a Shore town would rake in waves of revenue from its beaches. But that’s not always the case. Point Pleasant Beach, for example, doesn’t own most of its beaches but is responsible for some of the costs associated with millions of visitors every summer, according to Mayor Vincent Barrella. "Point Pleasant Beach does not own its beaches; they are privately owned and operated by businesses such as Jenkinson’s," Barrella wrote in an Aug. 22 column that appeared in The star-Ledger. Could it be true that some of the most popular beachfront along the Jersey Shore is privately owned? PolitiFact New Jersey found that more than 42 acres of beach are privately owned and operated in Point Pleasant Beach, and the borough owns only the 1.03-acre Maryland Avenue Beach. Several other Shore towns also do not own their beaches, said Larry Hajna, spokesman for the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection. Let’s look at beach ownership in the borough. Point Pleasant Beach has approximately two miles of privately held oceanfront property, according to the borough’s 2006 Open Space and Recreation Plan. The public can access nearly 30 of those 42 acres by purchasing daily or seasonal badges from private operators. The remaining beach is not open to the public, according to the plan. Most of the borough’s beaches are owned by Jenkinson’s, Martell’s, Risdens Beach Inc., the Elizabeth Carter Association and a number of private homeowners. One of the largest beaches in the borough is owned by Jenkinson’s, but the company also has the costs that come along with it. "We own it, operate it, insure it and staff it," said Marilou Halvorsen, marketing director for Jenkinson’s Boardwalk. Although the Maryland Avenue Beach is owned by the borough, Aqua Serve Lifeguard Service leases and operates it. The difference in ownership means Aqua can charge whatever admission fee the market can bear, while municipal operation of the beach would mean the state sets the maximum fee, said Borough Clerk Maryann Ellsworth. And that’s been a losing proposition for the community. "We lost so much money running it that we decided at least six years ago to lease out the running of the beach," said Ellsworth, who added that the borough lost from $10,000 to $14,000 annually when it operated the beach. Aqua Serve pays the borough $2,000 annually to operate Maryland Avenue beach, but that money is largely eaten up in costs the borough pays for portable toilets there, Ellsworth said. The daily badge fee at Maryland Avenue Beach is $8. Beaches and the cost to operate them was even an issue for the town’s forefathers. Minutes from the Aug. 16, 1887 meeting of the Point Pleasant Beach Council state "Ownership of the beach turned down by the Council because of extreme cost to the borough for maintenance," according to the Point Pleasant Historical Society. At that point, the council decided to permit privately owned beaches in the borough. Still, Barrella told PolitiFact New Jersey that he hopes the borough can one day buy Risdens Beach if it ever becomes available, so the borough can generate revenue the way he said Belmar and Manasquan do from their beaches. Belmar’s beach badge revenue total was $3,023,386 from Memorial Day to Labor Day in 2010; and $2,657,278 from Memorial Day this year through Aug. 21, said Patricia Zwirz, purchasing agent. Manasquan, which has a utility to operate its beach, took in $1,793,000 from beach badges in 2010 for the same period as Belmar; and was at $1,695,000 just before Hurricane Irene hit the Jersey Shore, according to Beach Department manager/beach manager Walter Wall. Our ruling Barrella says the borough’s beaches are privately owned and operated by various businesses in town. While Jenkinson’s and others do own most of the beachfront, the borough owns slightly more than an acre of prime real estate: the Maryland Avenue beach. For that reason, we rate Barrella’s claim Mostly True. To coment on this ruling, go to NJ.com.	None	Vincent Barrella	None	None	None	2011-09-05T05:15:00	2011-08-22	['None']
pomt-12352	For 22 percent of N.H. Meals on Wheels recipients, the delivery driver is "the only human contact in their life from week to week."	true	/new-hampshire/statements/2017/jun/09/ann-mclane-kuster/kuster-says-meals-wheels-critical-human-lifeline-s/	New Hampshire could be considered one of the main exhibits of the "silver tsunami," a term used to refer to the aging population in the United States. Tied for second in the nation for the oldest population in terms of median age, the state is bracing for the effects of a declining workforce, strained medical services and ballooning public retirement benefits. But economists’ focus on those issues fails to capture the experiences of seniors living alone in their homes – sometimes after all their peers have died. U.S. Rep. Annie Kuster reminded listeners this week of the isolation of needy seniors with a depressing statistic she picked up from a ridealong with a local Meals on Wheels program. Kuster, a Hopkinton Democrat who was discussing the potential detrimental effects of President Donald Trump’s proposed budget, said for 22 percent of home delivery participants, "Meals on Wheels is the only human contact in their life from week to week, the only person they see." The claim was striking. Do so many needy seniors in New Hampshire have no one else in their lives but the Meals on Wheels driver? Kuster made the statement to group of nonprofit officials from the fields of child care, mental health and nutrition. She said the cuts proposed in Trump’s budget outline, especially an 18 percent reduction to the Department of Health and Human Services, were "so dramatic and so Draconian." To be clear, the president’s budget is just a spending plan and it does not earmark any specific cuts to Meals on Wheels. It's premature for us to project what could happen to Meals on Wheels spending, so we not checking whether Trump's budget is Draconian; rather, we’re examining Kuster’s claim about the lonely lives of New Hampshire seniors. Meals on Wheels is a national program that serves 2.4 million people. It’s funded partly through federal dollars and delivered more than 137 million meals in 2016. We reached out to Kuster, who said her claim was about New Hampshire Meals on Wheels recipients, not a nationwide statistic. The best figures on this subject are kept by a coalition of Meals on Wheels affiliates in six New Hampshire counties that all administer the same survey each year. These organizations cover both the most rural and also the most densely populated parts of the state. Meghan Brady is the longtime president of St. Joseph Community Services, which is based in Merrimack and is one of the members of the New Hampshire Coalition of Aging Services. As a group, the coalition served more than 1.1 million meals to more than 13,000 older and disabled adults in 2016, Brady said. It’s made up of the Community Action Program of Belknap-Merrimack Counties (in Concord), the Grafton County Senior Citizens Council (in Lebanon), Ossipee Concerned Citizens (in Center Ossipee), Tri-County Community Action Program (in Berlin) and St. Joseph Community Services (in Merrimack). In the fall, the coalition delivers a survey along with its meals to everyone who’s in the program at the time, she said. The return rate is better than half. "On any given day, the likelihood is the delivery person is the only individual the Meals on Wheels recipient will see, but for 21 percent of them, the driver is the only person they’ll see all week," Brady said, quoting last year’s statewide statistics. For her program in particular, the 22 percent statistic that Kuster cited is dead on, she said. At the event Kuster's staffer offered a different statistic, but she said 22 percent, so we'll stick to that number. Brady, who has been working for St. Joseph Community Services for 22 years, said she’s seen this situation grow worse in recent years. "Over the last several years, all of us have seen an increase in isolation and hunger," she said. "We measure this by the annual surveys, by the requests we receive for additional food and by the number and type of follow-ups we do," such as calling social workers on clients’ behalves, putting them in touch with additional services and sometimes calling 911. Some of the other findings, she said, are significant: 63 percent reported that because of the Meals on Wheels program, they can continue to live in their homes, and 36 percent reported that they don’t always have enough money or food stamps to obtain the food they need without the deliveries. "We have a gentleman who’s in our program who is 102. How old do you think his kids are?" she asked. "People are living longer. We have people who have outlived family and friends, so this is very important." St. Joseph’s Community Services raises about 30 percent of its budget privately, she said, but it also relies on a few sources of government funding, which was the context in which Kuster originally made her claim. Some news media outlets reported Trump’s budget director allegedly claiming that Meals on Wheels is "not showing results." The Washington Post’s fact-checker investigated that claim and found he never said that. As for the budget’s impacts on Meals on Wheels, it’s not exactly clear yet, Brady said. "My understanding is that the proposed budget includes an 18 percent decrease at the Department of Health and Human Services at the federal level," she said. "Two of our funding sources are in that area. What impact that cut would have, we do not know." On thing that is clear in the budget is that it seeks to nix funding for a federal Housing and Urban Development program called Community Development Block Grants. Brady said her organization has received a $42,000 block grant, but that’s only a sliver of the total $3.6 million in revenue and support the nonprofit reported last year from the government and donors. Nationally, Meals on Wheels doesn’t keep data specific to human interaction, said Jenny Bertolette Young, the vice president of communications. "We do know that 51 percent of home-delivered meal recipients live alone," she said in an email. "One would assume that homebound recipients that live alone likely lack human contact outside of the Meals on Wheels volunteer." She said it’s a "common anecdote" that the driver is oftentimes the only person a recipient will see in a given day. Our ruling Kuster said for 22 percent of Meals on Wheels home recipients, the driver "is the only human contact in their life from week to week, the only person they see." The depressing statistic is backed up by the data collected by a coalition of Meals on Wheels providers in New Hampshire. We rate the claim True.

pomt-12098	Says the Joker's "Red Hood" origin story is "the true one."	mostly false	/punditfact/statements/2017/aug/25/jake-tapper/joker-origin-story-draws-out-geek-cnns-jake-tapper/	For Batman fans, the history of the Joker is no laughing matter. A report that said Warner Bros. is working on a spinoff featuring the origins of the arch-villain led to a Twitter tussle between DailyWire.com editor Ben Shapiro and CNN’s Jake Tapper. On Aug. 23, 2017, Shapiro tweeted his dismay at the news that Warner Bros. may feature a young version of the Joker, with a gritty, 1980s-style backdrop similar to potential producer Martin Scorsese’s well-known crime dramas. "The whole point of the Joker is that he has no set origin story," Shapiro said, including a link about the potential film. Tapper, apparently a Caped Crusader devotee, tweeted a reply contradicting Shapiro: "Not true, you obviously never heard of the RED HOOD." Tapper included a page from Detective Comics No. 168, which was released in 1951. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com The page shows the Joker telling Batman how he once had been a laboratory worker who attempted to steal $1 million from the Monarch Playing Card Company. He made his escape by swimming through chemical waste, which turned his skin white and his hair green. He took his name from the eponymous playing card and has been arching Batman ever since. But something sounded off to this fact-checker, who thought Shapiro had a point about the Joker’s past being mysterious. PolitiFact has written about whether there’s been a female Thor, and whether Wonder Woman’s Gal Gadot or Man of Steel’s Henry Cavill is paid more money, so we have some experience. In true geek fashion, we raised this objection with Tapper, saying that the Red Hood origin story was just the one with which people were most familiar. "Because it's the true one," Tapper replied. See Figure 2 on PolitiFact.com We’ll see about that. Red Hood or red herring? The most succinct reply to this came from Nick Valente, a publicist for DC Comics. "You are correct, there is no definitive backstory for the Joker," he said. CASE CLOSED! But wait! Like most comic book plotlines, there’s always room for this story to expand and change. The Joker has been around almost as long as Batman himself, first appearing in 1940s Batman No. 1, when the Dark Knight got his own title after starting in Detective Comics a year earlier. There have been several iterations of the character, but through the decades he has been portrayed largely as a psychotic killer, bent on antagonizing Batman and the people of Gotham City. The Joker had no backstory to speak of until 1951, when the anecdote about the Red Hood that Tapper cited was printed. Versions of this origin have appeared in various forms over the years, with details changed. Glen Weldon, author of The Caped Crusade: Batman and the Rise of Nerd Culture‎, said that DC gave the character an origin story, but that was "back in the halcyon days before a ravenous fanbase insisted that every random story must calcify into canonical truth." One of the most famous modern versions of the Red Hood story is Alan Moore’s account in 1988’s The Killing Joke, in which the Joker is a former engineer and failed comedian who leads armed robbers into his former employer, Ace Chemical Processing, Inc., after the death of his pregnant wife. He wears the Red Hood as a disguise and jumps into the chemicals to flee Batman. See Figure 3 on PolitiFact.com But that doesn’t mean we should believe the Joker, because, well, he’s the Joker. He’s an unreliable narrator, because his insanity keeps him from telling the truth, and us from knowing the difference. Even Moore’s version of the Joker acknowledged that his story is essentially unknowable. "Sometimes I remember it one way, sometimes another," the Joker said. "If I’m going to have a past, I prefer it to be multiple choice!" There are plenty of other variations of the story. Sometimes Batman knocks the Joker into the vat, sometimes the hapless criminal jumps. Sometimes the Red Hood isn’t involved at all. Later storylines show that the Red Hood is an alias adopted by many other criminals. Eventually, even Batman’s sidekick Robin dons the Red Hood. "Since that (1951) story was first published, just about every time any comic's made even the most casual reference to Joker's origin, the Red Hood bit has come and gone, but the ‘fall into a vat of acid, goes nuts’ thing remains," Weldon said. The movies complicate things further. In the 1989 film version of Batman, Jack Nicholson’s Joker is a lifelong criminal named Jack Napier (the only time the Joker is given a first and last name) who actually is the man who killed Bruce Wayne’s parents. The late Heath Ledger’s acclaimed 2008 take on the Joker in The Dark Knight gives a nod to the ambiguity of it all, with the grease-painted antagonist telling different characters more than one version of how he was disfigured. (There’s also an offshoot movie based on Jared Leto’s tattooed Joker and Harley Quinn from 2016’s Suicide Squad coming, but that’s a different set of issues altogether.) DC Comics recognizes that their most famous villain juggles the truth. Their Origin of the Joker showed the killer acknowledging that even he gets confused by which story is right. See Figure 4 on PolitiFact.com "Though the Red Hood story — in its blurriest form of spills and chemical burns — is perhaps the most-pointed to origin story for the Joker, it is by no means the definitive one," said Brad Ricca, SAGES Fellow at Case Western Reserve University and a comics historian. Recent comic book storylines have suggested that Batman has actually matched wits with three different Jokers through the years. Other stories hint further that the Joker may be immortal. The character has cycled through several personalities and backstories, sometimes insane and sometimes not, but always a dark-humored and lethal opponent for Batman. That’s the strength of comic books, which are free to retroactively change the continuity however the creators see fit, our experts said. Will Brooker, a film and cultural studies professor at Kingston University, said that the most sinister aspect of the character is that inability to define how he became the way he is. "My feeling is that to pin Joker down to a fixed backstory and identity is reductive, unimaginative and suggests a lack of understanding of what Joker is really about," said Brooker, author of Batman Unmasked: Analyzing a Cultural Icon. "He is essentially the opposite of Batman, who has a fixed, definite origin. The whole point is that Batman can never work out who Joker is and where he came from." Our ruling Tapper said the Joker's "Red Hood" origin story is "the true one." That's right, we're fact-checking where the Joker came from. So sue us! This claim is throwing down the gauntlet for comic book nerds, pointing to a 1951 backstory about the Joker wearing a disguise and swimming through chemical waste as the one, true origin of the archvillain. He may prefer that version, and that’s fine, because it’s not wrong. But comic historians and even a DC Comics publicist we consulted agreed that the Joker has no definitive backstory — indeed, that is one of the defining strengths of the character.

In it, Priebus offered a striking statistic. "The tax hikes President Obama wants will only fuel Washington's addiction to spending rather than help curb it," he wrote. "More importantly, they will hurt one of the strongest engines of growth and job creation in our economy: small businesses. And they will harm middle-class families by taking more money from their pockets at a time when Americans need every dime to cover their expenses. In fact, according to the Tax Foundation, Americans will pay more in taxes in 2011 than they will spend on food, clothing and housing combined -- and it's still not enough for Barack Obama." The reader wondered whether it was really true that "Americans will pay more in taxes in 2011 than they will spend on groceries, clothing and shelter combined." So we decided to look into it. Before we checked with the Tax Foundation, the source Priebus cited, we did our own math. First, we’ll note that no one -- including Priebus -- knows for sure how Americans will allocate their money in 2011, since more than half the year hasn’t happened yet. The best we can do is extrapolate from previous years. Given the data available, the last year for which we can do it accurately is 2009. We began by measuring expenditures on groceries, clothing and shelter. For this, we turned to statistics collected by the Bureau of Economic Analysis, an office within the U.S. Commerce Department. In a data series known as National Income and Product Accounts, the bureau tracks how Americans spend their income. For 2009, Americans spent almost $778 billion for food and beverages consumed at home. For clothing, the figure is $322 billion, and for housing, it’s $1.582 trillion. Total expenditures: $2.682 trillion. For taxes paid, we had to look in two places. The amount of federal taxes paid is included in the historical tables for the president’s fiscal year 2012 budget proposal. In 2009, the federal government took in $2.105 trillion in revenues. As for the states and localities, the Tax Foundation found a total of $1.282 trillion in taxes collected. Add both of these tax categories together and you get $3.387 trillion in taxes. So in 2009, Americans did indeed pay more in taxes than they did for food, clothing or shelter. By that calculation, Priebus is correct, as is the Tax Foundation, the source of his information. (It would have been closer if Priebus had said "food" rather than groceries, since Americans spent an additional $513 billion for food in restaurants. But he didn’t.) Some economists, however, say this is not the only way to calculate it. The Tax Foundation calculation shows that the average American pays more for taxes than for food, clothing and shelter. But there are wide variations in what individual Americans pay. One chart published by the Urban Institute-Brookings Institution Tax Policy Center shows what percentage of income is paid in taxes by Americans of different income levels. There are wide differences. Households with less than $10,000 in annual income actually get a small amount of money back from the federal government, often through the Earned Income Tax Credit, a refundable federal income tax credit for low to moderate income working individuals and families. For Americans with incomes between $10,000 and $20,000, only three-tenths of 1 percent of income goes toward taxes. For those between $20,000 and $30,000, less than 6 percent went to taxes. And for those between $30,000 and $40,000 in income, less than 11 percent is spent on federal taxes. Now let’s compare that to patterns of spending. According to the Bureau of Economic Analysis, for taxpayers of all incomes, groceries accounted for about 8 percent of personal consumption expenditures in 2009, while clothing accounted for 3 percent and housing accounted for 16 percent. Combined, that’s 27 percent. Meanwhile, "Personal consumption expenditures" accounted for about 89 percent of total personal income. So food, clothing and housing probably account for roughly 25 percent of personal income. While we couldn’t find these statistics for different income classes, lower-income Americans would probably spend a larger percentage of their incomes on these items, since these are necessities, and they have less overall to spend. So, for those toward the the bottom of the income scale, the tax burden -- even when adjusted for state and local taxes -- is probably less than 20 percent, while spending on food, clothing and shelter probably accounts for 25 percent or more. By contrast, the higher you go up the income ladder, the more accurate Priebus’ claim becomes. Those with incomes between $100,000 and $200,000 pay 20 percent of their income in federal taxes. Between $200,000 and $500,000, it’s 23 percent, and between $500,000 and $1 million, it’s 25 percent. And for those over $1 million, it’s 27 percent. Add in state and local taxes and these percentages climb even higher. Meanwhile, the percentage spent on necessities is probably lower than 25 percent. So, many people within these upper-income groups do likely pay more in taxes than in food, clothing and shelter. The difference is that, according to the Tax Policy Center, these upper-income groups account for a smaller share of the population. Approximately 44 percent of Americans have annual cash incomes at $40,000 or below -- the first category we looked at, in which people likely pay more in food, clothing and shelter than in taxes. By contrast, about 22 percent of Americans have annual cash incomes of at least $100,000, a level at which the tax burden likely outpaces food, clothing and shelter. So while a substantial minority of Americans probably does pay more for taxes, the numbers suggest that there are more Americans whose food, clothing and shelter expenses exceed their tax burden. This doesn’t mean that the Tax Foundation calculation is not useful. Kail Padgitt, a staff economist for the Tax Foundation, notes that the study "is purposefully designed to take an aggregate look at the overall tax burden of the country, not any one individual person." Among other things, the way the Tax Foundation calculates it is helpful for studying changes in the tax burden over time, and in comparing the United States’ tax burden to that of other countries. J.D. Foster, an economist with the conservative Heritage Foundation, calls the dispute "an age-old running battle." He said "The Tax Foundation is using averages. The purpose of averages is to summarize information." When Priebus says that "Americans will pay more in taxes in 2011 than they will spend on groceries, clothing and shelter combined," his statement is vague enough to be read either as an aggregate measurement (in which case he’d be correct) or a description of the patterns for individual Americans (in which case he’d likely be wrong more often than he’s right). On balance, we rate his statement Half True.	None	Reince Priebus	None	None	None	2011-04-18T12:17:19	2011-04-14	['United_States']
pomt-11662	"Queen Elizabeth removes Obamas from royal wedding guest list."	pants on fire!	/punditfact/statements/2018/jan/08/american-today/no-proof-queen-elizabeth-removed-obamas-prince-har/	The guest list for Prince Harry’s wedding to Meghan Markle has been the subject of fake news accounts — including one that Queen Elizabeth delivered a "well-deserved and humiliating beatdown" to Michelle Obama by striking her from the guest list. "Queen Elizabeth removes Obamas from royal wedding guest list," said a Dec. 10 headline on America Today. Facebook users flagged the post as being potentially fabricated, as part of the social network’s efforts to combat fake news. The story is similar to an earlier article by Just News USA. We found only speculative news reports about whether the Obamas would be invited and no official reports about the guest list. We found no credible news articles which stated that the Queen struck the Obamas from the list. The fake story said that when Michelle Obama heard that Harry was marrying a black woman (Markle is biracial) she tried to "sneak a spot on the guest list." "Barack, who had been practically stalking Prince Harry on Twitter in recent weeks, made a post within seconds of the news coming out, which served the purpose of letting the Royals know that he and Michelle were angling for an invitation to the wedding of the year," the story said. Ever since the couple announced their engagement in November, there have been multiple speculative news reports about who will and won’t be invited to the wedding. Some news reports based on unnamed sources said that the couple want the Obamas at their May 19 wedding. While the royal family has been friendly with the Obamas, we found no official reports. The royal family has put out two press releases regarding the engagement in November, and neither mention an invite list. On Dec. 27, while guest-editing a BBC morning radio program, Harry joked that the guest list was still a ways off. "I don't know about that -- we haven't even put the invite or the guest list together yet. Who knows if (Obama's) going to be invited or not," Harry said. "I wouldn't want to ruin that surprise." News reports have speculated about whether Trump will be invited to the royal wedding although there is precedent for sitting U.S. presidents to not attend. While those reports are speculative, Markle was critical of Trump before her engagement. In May 2016 while on The Nightly Show with Larry Wilmore, Markle said Trump was "divisive" and "misogynistic." A headline said that "Queen Elizabeth removes Obamas from royal wedding guest list." We found no credible reports that the Queen took this action -- just speculation about whether the Obamas will be invited. We rate this headline Pants on Fire.

pomt-08017	Obama’s mid-term approval ratings are similar to other presidents who went on to re-election.	half-true	/virginia/statements/2011/jan/10/tim-kaine/tim-kaine-says-obamas-approval-ratings-fine-compar/	With Democrats woozy from their shellacking in November’s congressional elections, political junkies are riveted on 2012 and whether President Barack Obama will win a second term. No one is putting a better spin on Obama’s fortunes than Tim Kaine, chairman of the Democratic National Committee. He wrote an end-of-the year column for Politico, a Washington news organization, saying Obama’s "list of achievements already dwarfs that of many presidents." Kaine, a former Virginia governor, encountered skepticism during a TV interview last Sunday. Ed Henry, CNN’s senior White House corespondent, noted Obama’s approval rating from voters dropped 6 percentage points in 2010. "You made your case but it seems like the American people aren’t buying it, sir," Henry said. Kaine replied, "Relatively, if you look at the president’s mid-term numbers compared to other presidents in their mid-term, he’s fine." We decided to take a closer look. Kaine was responding to a Gallup poll conducted in the final week of December that showed 47 percent of adult Americans approved of Obama’s job performance, 45 percent disapproved and 8 percent were undecided. First, we asked for clarification of what Kaine meant when he said Obama is "fine." Alec Gerlach, a DNC press secretary, said Kaine meant Obama’s mid-term poll numbers "are in the neighborhood of other presidents who got re-elected, including Reagan and Clinton." So for this fact-check we will focus on whether Obama's ratings are indeed similar to presidents who got re-elected. Then we researched polls by Gallup because it has the longest record of tracking presidential popularity, dating to 1937 when Franklin Roosevelt was beginning his second term. We compared Obama’s numbers to the approval ratings other presidents received at the start of the year after mid-term congressional elections. To keep the comparison consistent, we turned to the first Gallup poll on Obama completely conducted in 2011. A survey from Jan. 2 to Jan. 4 found the president had 49 percent approval, 45 percent disapproval and 6 percent were undecided on his job perfromance. The average mid-term mark for presidents -- from Roosevelt in 1939 through Obama in 2011 -- is 53.5 percent approval, 36 percent disapproval and 10.5 percent undecided. Obama seems to be in the neighborhood, but not on the best street. Let’s look at the presidents who got reelected in that time span. Their average mid-term approval was 57 percent and disapproval was 35 percent. Obama is not in that school district. But neither were Ronald Reagan nor Bill Clinton midway through their first terms. Then they moved up quickly. Reagan was the least popular mid-term president. At the start of 1983, with the nation emerging from recession, he had 37 percent approval and 54 percent disapproval. Less than two years later, Reagan carried all but one state in a landslide reelection. Bill Clinton’s numbers at the start of 1995 were similar to Obama’s today. Clinton had 47 percent approval, 45 percent disapproval. In 1996, he was easily reelected. In contrast, George H.W. Bush had a robust 59 percent approval rating in early 1991 only to lose reelection the next year. All told, we were able to find the last 19 mid-term presidential polls by Gallup. Obama’s approval rating is the 11th highest. Of the eight presidents below him, four times their party retained the White House in the next election, and four times it didn’t. Larry Sabato, a University of Virginia political scientist, says mid-term polls are a horrible gauge of coming elections because a president’s popularity can soar or plummet with events. "They don’t say a thing," he said. "The numbers that matter are the votes of people and, considering the beating Democrats took on Nov. 7, the president is by no means OK, assured of a successful term or a second one." Let’s review. Kaine, with his spokesman’s elaboration, said Obama’s mid-term polling popularity is "fine" compared to other presidents who went on to re-election. Kaine is correct in saying that Obama’s numbers compare favorably to Reagan and Clinton. But the president’s mid-term approval rating -- gauged by the first poll completely conducted in the new mid-term year -- is 8 percentage points below the average of re-elected presidents since 1939. His disapproval rating is 10 percentage points above the average. We know those numbers can change in an instant. But when a politician is down by 8 or 10 percentage points, we say he’s behind but within striking distance. We rate Kaine’s statement Half True.

pomt-04371	"There are more oil rigs in operation in the United States than the rest of the world combined."	false	/rhode-island/statements/2012/oct/22/david-cicilline/us-rep-david-cicilline-says-us-has-more-oil-rigs-o/	Are we doing enough to produce energy in the United States? That was one of the issues on the table when U.S. Rep. David Cicilline, a Democrat, and former state police Col. Brendan Doherty, a Republican, squared off in a WPRI - Providence Journal debate Oct. 16. Doherty talked about a bill he supports that would raise revenue for infrastructure by allowing more oil and gas drilling on federally-owned lands. Cicilline called it "a big, big giveaway to big oil . . . when we already know, according to the best available data as of February of this year, there are more oil rigs in operation in the United States than the rest of the world combined." More oil rigs in operation than everyone else in the world? That's quite a statistic. We wondered if it is true. This is a talking point that has been used in the past by the Obama administration. In fact, when we asked the Cicilline campaign for the source of the factoid, they sent us to a blog entry at the White House website that stated it without giving a source or offering any numbers. PolitiFact Florida looked at the claim (and a related claim) this winter, when President Obama offered it in February during speeches in Miami and earlier in New Hampshire. They found that the answer wasn't quite so simple. The U.S. Energy Information Administration recommended that PolitiFact get the latest count from Baker Hughes, an oilfield services company. We checked the numbers from two weeks ago. (For even more recent numbers, go here.) As of Oct. 12, 2012, the company had tallied 1,835 oil and gas drilling rigs in the United States and 1,615 in other countries. (That U.S. number is 188 lower than the 2011 total. The international number is 71 rigs higher.) However, the Baker Hughes data do not include rigs drilling in Russia or onshore China because those statistics are difficult to get. Richard Mason, who works for the publication Hart Energy Digital, told PolitiFact in February that "the last numbers I saw out of Russia, which are 18 months old, had more than 1,000 rigs active." Kurt Abraham, executive editor of World Oil, another energy publication, cited a report from a Chinese state-owned company that manufactures rigs and rig equipment that showed more than 1,000 land rigs. As Cicilline’s statement stood, only 221 more international rigs were need to make it False. And the Baker Hughes count is probably missing the approximately 2,000 rigs in Russia and China. And all that was applicable in February. Our ruling David Cicilline said, "There are more oil rigs in operation in the United States than the rest of the world combined." He said that information comes from "the best available data" in February. He's relying on a count that excludes some of the largest producers of oil and gas in the world, calling that the "best available data." It's not. The best available data would take into account reliable evidence that two thousand rigs are in operation in China and Russia, a number that would allow the world total to overwhelm the U.S. total. Just because you haven't counted something, doesn't mean it's not there. For that reason, we rate Cicilline's claim False. (Get updates from PolitiFact Rhode Island on Twitter: @politifactri.

pomt-06731	Say Oregon Reps. Peter DeFazio and Earl Blumenauer are "socialists who are openly serving in the U.S. Congress."	pants on fire!	/oregon/statements/2011/aug/29/blog-posting/bloggers-claim-peter-defazio-and-earl-blumenauer-a/	Democratic Rep. Peter DeFazio has been called a lot of things over his 12 terms in Congress -- hot head, visionary, renegade, principled, effective and determined. Now, if a burst of activity on websites and blogs in recent weeks is to be believed, DeFazio is something else -- a socialist. And he’s not alone. The posts, all of which piggyback from a single offering that has been replicated on dozens of websites in recent weeks, says there are 70 card-carrying Socialists in the House of Representatives, including Rep. Earl Blumenauer, another Democrat from Oregon. (The number actually varies. Some posts say 70 while others insist it’s either 73 or 76. One post used both 76 and 75 in the same entry.) An Aug. 12 post on the website for a group called Sovereign Citizens United mentions DeFazio and Blumenauer by name. It also says this: "I’m sure if you asked random people on the street if we had open socialists in the US Congress, they would say – well only Bernie Sanders (Senate). But the right answer is much, much worse." "This should come as a surprise to absolutely no one," says an Aug. 16 post on ConservativeByte.com. "The radical Marxist-progressives (communists) took control of the Democrat party some time ago. They’ve only become more emboldened with the election of Barack Obama, who was raised as a communist from birth." In case you miss the point, the post comes equipped with a large and very bright hammer and sickle emblem. While most of the names politicians are called are opinions, calling a congressman a Socialist sounds both emphatic and exact, which always gets our attention here at PolitiFact Oregon. Another thing that gets our attention is when a claim gets spread far and wide. This one meets that test, too. Here’s a blog post on Aug. 17 by Texas radio host Dan Cofall, whose show airs out of Fort Worth: "The magic number ‘70’ is the number of members of the 111th Congress who are members of the Democratic Socialists of America (DSA). These are not just politicians who vote left of center; these are card-carrying members of ‘The Democratic Socialists of America’." Cofall did not respond to an email asking for comment. And we couldn’t reach anyone from ConservativeByte. Before we get to our ruling, let’s begin with some basics. Congress resets itself every two years, which means the current edition is the 112th Congress, not the 111th. Why does that matter? Because the new Congress that begins in January every two years always follows an election and some of the people on the list are no longer in office. Cofall acknowledges this but then continues to list names from the 111th Congress anyway. Those listed as "card carrying" socialists who are no longer serving include: Robert Wexler (Florida), Phil Hare (Illinois), John Hall (New York), Alan Grayson (Florida), and Neil Abercrombie (Hawaii). Then there’s this: Real card-carrying Socialists say those members, including DeFazio and Blumenauer, aren’t Socialists. The list that Cofall and dozens more rely upon "is completely fraudulent," said Frank Llewellyn, who served as national director of the Democratic Socialists of America for 10 years until stepping down July 5. There is not one member of Congress who is a formal member of the DSA, Llewellyn said. In order to join, a person must fill out a form and pay dues. Even Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, a self-described democratic socialist, is not a formal member of the DSA, Llewellyn said. The last member of Congress who was an actual card-carrying member, he said, was California Democratic Rep. Ron Dellums, who served 28 years in the House until leaving in 1998. Llewellyn and DSA’s new national director, Maria Svart are chagrined for two reasons. First, they have to spend time knocking down reports that never seem to go away. Second, Llewellyn said, "if we had formal political relationships with 70-odd members, we would be making a lot more money’’ from dues. For the record, both DeFazio and Blumenauer say they’ve never been associated with the Democratic Socialists of America. "This is another made-up Internet rumor that has no merit," DeFazio said. "I am a proud Democrat who has taken many independent stands over the years. I am anti-so called free trade, pro-American jobs, pro-infrastructure investment, pro-fair taxation, anti-amnesty, pro-balanced budget amendment, pro-Wall Street re-regulation, and pro-audit the Pentagon and Federal Reserve. I am an Oregonian and an independent thinker." Blumenauer was equally annoyed. "No matter which side of the political aisle it comes from, this kind of name calling and rhetoric represents exactly what is wrong with our democracy today," he said. "Rather than bringing people together to solve our nation's problems, it spreads false and divisive allegations throughout the media and the public. It is a major distraction from the real work that needs to get done." Bad information gets spread all the time. But where did the number, or numbers, come from? The list purported to have originated with the DSA says this on page two: Q: How many members of the U.S. Congress are also members of the DSA? A: Seventy It then lists them by name. What it does not say is that the names are simply lifted en masse from the membership of the Congressional Progressive Caucus, a collection of liberal-leaning lawmakers that includes DeFazio and Blumenauer but officially, not a single socialist. According to its website, the Progressive Caucus is one of the largest in Congress and works for such causes as economic justice, civil rights and civil liberties as well as global peace and security. Llewellyn said that DSA supports some of the policy positions of the caucus. Voicing support for positions embraced by a group of lawmakers is a routine part of business on Capitol Hill and is employed by organizations as disparate as the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the National Rifle Association and NORML, a group devoted to legalizing the use of marijuana. But agreeing with some positions doesn’t make a member of Congress a card-carrying Socialist. Llewellyn says similar accusations of Socialism (with a capital S) have surfaced every election year since 1991 when the Progressive Caucus was created. "There’s nothing we can do to stop it, Llewellyn said. "I can’t tell you the number of times we’ve tried to stop it." Misinformation and smear campaigns also are part of political life. But these persistent claims about socialists are riddled with errors and outright lies. Any one of the problems would be sufficient to discredit the report, but taken together, the effort is flagrantly false. For that reason, we rate this claim: Pants on Fire.

pomt-13243	"Back in the Great Recession, when millions of jobs across America hung in the balance, Donald Trump said rescuing the auto industry didn’t really matter very much. He said, and I quote again, ‘Let it go.’ "	pants on fire!	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/oct/18/hillary-clinton/clinton-twists-trumps-words-rescuing-auto-industry/	Donald Trump didn’t care about rescuing the auto industry during the 2008 recession, Hillary Clinton said at a rally in Michigan. Clinton told her audience at Wayne State University in Detroit that she supported the 2008 government bailout for the American auto industry, which was faltering during the financial crisis. But Trump, she said, doesn’t support American workers, much less those in Michigan’s auto industry. "Nobody should be surprised, because back in the Great Recession, when millions of jobs across America hung in the balance, Donald Trump said rescuing the auto industry didn’t really matter very much," Clinton said at the Oct. 10 rally. "He said, and I quote again, ‘Let it go.’ Now, I can’t imagine that. I supported President (Barack) Obama’s decision to rescue the auto industry in America." Actually, Trump's public comments about the auto industry's demise were the opposite of what Clinton said. He called for saving it. In December 2008, when Congress and then-President George W. Bush were debating giving the auto industry a bailout, Trump gave several interviews in which he stressed the importance of saving the Big Three automakers: General Motors, Ford and Chrysler. Trump’s position on an auto bailout was inconsistent leading up to Dec. 19, 2008, when Bush laid out plans to go forward with the bailout. Trump said the government should help the auto companies, but he also regularly suggested the they could save themselves if they filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy, with some government support. Mid 2009, months into his first year as president, Obama forced Chrysler and General Motors to go through bankruptcy. While he might have clashed with Bush and Obama on exact particulars of how to solve the auto crisis, Trump consistently said the auto industry needed to be saved: Dec. 9, 2008, Fox: Trump told host Greta Van Susteren that "I think you have to try and save the companies, and I think you can easily save the companies." He added, referring to "bankruptcy," that auto companies "don't like the ‘B’ word. I think they probably should use it." Dec. 10, 2008, CNBC: "You have to save the car industry in this country," Trump said. "General Motors can be great again, Ford can be great again, and Chrysler could be great." Dec. 17, 2008, Fox: Cavuto asked Trump if he thought the country could do without one of the Big Three auto makers. Trump responded, "No. I think you should have the Big Three…. I think the government should stand behind them 100 percent. You cannot lose the auto companies. They are great. They make wonderful products. Maybe they are making too much. Maybe they are not making too much. I just bought a Dodge Ram truck from Arrigo Dodge, who is a member of one of my clubs and a great guy." Dec. 18, 2008, CNN: Host Wolf Blitzer asked Trump if Bush should bail out the auto industry. Trump replied, "Well, I hope he does it, but you have to make a much better deal with the unions. … The fact is you have to make the companies competitive. And if you're not going to make a deal with the union, and a great and fair deal and a competitive deal, then they shouldn't do it. But absolutely, they should try and save the companies. You just can't lose Chrysler, you can't lose Ford, and you can't lose General Motors." Clinton also quoted Trump saying "let it go," referring to the auto industry. Clinton’s phrasing makes it sound like Trump said that quote during the recession. But he actually said it in 2015. And Clinton took the comment out of context. "You could have let it go, and rebuilt itself, through the free enterprise system," Trump said in August 2015, according to the Washington Post. "You could have let it go bankrupt, frankly, and rebuilt itself, and a lot of people felt it should happen. Or you could have done it the way it went. I could have done it either way. Either way would have been acceptable. I think you would have wound up in the same place." So six years after the $80 billion bailout began, Trump has maintained his ambiguous position. He said either a bailout or just bankruptcy would have been fine. But his message was not firmly, as Clinton implied, that the country should have left the auto industry out to dry. Our ruling Clinton said, "Back in the Great Recession, when millions of jobs across America hung in the balance, Donald Trump said rescuing the auto industry didn’t really matter very much. He said, and I quote again, ‘Let it go.’ " Trump is documented as saying just the opposite during the recession. He regularly said the auto industry needed saving amid a low point for manufacturers in December 2008. He said the government should stand behind the auto industry "100 percent." Clinton also takes the "let it go" quote out of context and time. Trump made that comment in 2015, not 2008. And he was making the point that a number of actions could have saved the auto industry, one of which was "let it go" into bankruptcy. We rate Clinton’s statement Pants on Fire!

pomt-02737	Gov. Rick Scott "backed the federal shutdown."	mostly false	/florida/statements/2013/dec/18/florida-democratic-party/rick-scott-back-federal-shutdown-florida-democra/	Gov. Rick Scott had a "terrible 2013," says the Florida Democratic Party in a year-end video bashing the Republican leader who faces voters next year. The Democrats unveiled a long list of attacks, most of which were recycled from earlier attacks or news articles. But this one in particular caught our eye: "This fall Scott even backed the federal shutdown that cost Floridians millions each day and pushed America to the brink of default." We wanted to check if Scott, the self-described jobs governor, backed the October shutdown that furloughed hundreds of thousands of employees. Some House Republicans had hoped to use a shutdown to delay or defund the federal health care law, but that didn’t happen. What Scott said Scott didn’t get a vote on the federal shutdown so the only way to judge whether he "backed" it is by reading his words. We reviewed statements Scott made in news releases and to the media about the shutdown, which started Oct. 1 and ended Oct. 16. We found that Scott repeatedly bashed Obama and praised the way that Florida had handled its own finances, but he avoided taking a stance in favor or against the shutdown. On Sept. 30 Scott issued a news release that stated: "The impending federal government shutdown represents a failure of leadership. One of the most basic functions of governing is budgeting. At the state level, we compromise and negotiate to create a balanced budget every year. But, President Obama has shown no interest in negotiating or compromising. We have paid down state debt in Florida by $3.5 billion and paid back another $3.5 billion federal loan over the last two and a half years while also cutting taxes." (We should note that state debt is a very different animal than federal debt, and states are prohibited from running annual budget deficits.) In addition to that news release, a Scott spokeswoman sent us a few tweets by Scott ("The buck stops with the President. We need leadership now," and "@BarackObama and Congress should not take pay for every day of shutdown"). But none of those tweets shed much light on whether he thought shutting down the government was a good idea or not. During a news conference Oct. 9, Scott refused to answer questions about whether he agreed with Republicans in Washington who tied the budget to delaying or defunding Obamacare: "What I agree with is the fact that the buck stops with the president," Scott said. "It's disappointing he doesn't know how to compromise and negotiate to get a budget done. I've done it for three sessions...." The next day, Scott’s chief of staff announced that Florida would not use state funds to temporarily backfill federal programs. At the time, there was mounting criticism that the shutdown which closed federal parks was a blow to the fishing and tourism industry in the Keys. On Oct. 16, Obama signed a bill that ended the shutdown. Scott criticized the fact that it wasn't a long-term agreement on debt and said that "our nation’s leaders have their heads in the sand about our economic future." A spokesman for the Florida Democratic Party pointed to two blog posts -- from the Tampa Bay Times and the Florida Times-Union -- that stated Scott’s position on the shutdown aligned him with congressional Republicans and pointed to Scott’s repeated criticism of Obama. While it’s true that Scott did put blame on Obama, a review of Scott’s actual statements shows that he appeared to dodge the question of whether he supported or opposed the shutdown as a political tactic. Instead, Scott used the shutdown as a chance to criticize Obama and call for reducing federal spending and debt. One final note: The Florida Democratic Party also said the shutdown would "cost Floridians millions each day." Financial analysts at Moody’s estimated the shutdown cost the economy about $20 billion in direct and indirect effects, or roughly $4 per day for every man, woman and child in America. Based on Florida’s population of about 19 million, that translates to about $77 million per day in Florida. "It’s fair to say that the shutdown cost Floridians as economic agents and as taxpayers millions per day," Moody’s economist Brian Kessler said. Our ruling The Florida Democratic Party said that Scott "backed the federal shutdown." Scott used the October shutdown as an opportunity to tout the state’s fiscal management and wag his finger at Obama. But a review of Scott’s statements about the shutdown shows that he dodged taking a clear stand favoring or opposing the shutdown itself. We rate this claim Mostly False.

pomt-12552	"When public schools face increased competition, they get better and kids learn more."	mostly false	/new-hampshire/statements/2017/apr/17/jeb-bush/does-school-competition-lift-all-boats-jeb-bush-sa/	As New Hampshire considers the merits of a universal Education Savings Account bill, education reformers nationwide are watching - and weighing in. Senate Bill 193 would allow parents to use 90 percent of the per-pupil grant the state gives to local public schools and instead put it toward alternative educational expenses, including private school tuition or homeschooling. ESAs function basically like vouchers, but they give parents more options about how the money can be spent. Proponents of ESAs tout them as the next evolution in school choice. If SB 193 is passed by the House (it cleared the Senate in March), it would be one of the most expansive school choice laws in the country. Former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, whose Foundation for Excellence in Education is backing market-based education reform efforts nationwide, submitted an op-ed in New Hampshire papers this week, urging passage of the bill. "This legislation (will not) hurt public schools. In fact, a large body of research, including that done in my home state of Florida, indicates quite the opposite. When public schools face increased competition, they get better and kids learn more," he wrote. Critics of choice typically say that diverting funds from public schools hurt those schools. So putting aside the question of whether vouchers actually help the kids who use them, we wondered: Does research show that school choice, and specifically vouchers, help public schools get better? ESAs, like vouchers, have traditionally been targeted to certain types of students, like those in low-performing schools or students with disabilities. But the bill in New Hampshire, as it’s currently written, is open to all. Five states so far have adopted ESA programs -- Arizona, Mississippi, Tennessee, Florida, and Nevada -- but only Nevada and Arizona have recently opened up eligibility to all, as New Hampshire is considering doing. Bush’s team at the Foundation for Excellence in Education pointed us to a compilation of 30 policy briefs and academic studies put together by EdChoice, a school choice advocacy group. In all but one of the studies cited by EdChoice, researchers found some sort of gain for public schools facing competition from vouchers or tax-credit scholarships. But most of the studies compiled by the advocacy group found only modest positive relationships between test scores in public schools and competition from voucher programs or tax-credit scholarship programs. Here’s how EdChoice explained that: "Many existing voucher programs are limited in the number and type of students they’re allowed to serve and the amount of choice they’re allowed to offer. Narrowly constricted programs produce narrowly constricted results. To produce revolutionary results, we would need broad programs -- eligibility for all students," the group wrote on its website page where the studies are posted. But David Figlio -- who co-authored three of the studies cited by EdChoice -- said expanding eligibility for these programs wouldn’t necessarily produce more positive gains. "Less responsible voucher advocates will say that this is proof positive that these programs work," said Figlio, who is the Orrington Lunt Professor of Education and Social Policy at Northwestern University. "I think a more responsible take on this is these programs don’t seem to be hurting public schools -- at the scale that they’re at." Figlio has studied the effects of voucher programs in Ohio and Florida and found "modest positive gains," he said, for students in public schools facing competition from voucher programs. He added later: "Key emphasis on the word modest." Figlio said it was important to note two things about the voucher systems he had studied -- the types of students they served, and the number, and cautioned against overstating the research. "In both Florida and Ohio, these are programs that are serving very disadvantaged students," Figlio said. "I would feel very uncomfortable with taking that work and looking at vouchers for more advantaged kids." The number of students participating in the programs Figlio studied were small. And so it makes sense, he said, that schools would have retained the capacity to make improvements -- because they hadn’t lost that much revenue. Figlio said he wasn’t aware of domestic research that had shown negative effects of vouchers on public schools. But research in the U.S. has so far just looked at relatively small, targeted voucher programs. The program being proposed in New Hampshire would be open to all public school students. So Figlio suggested research in foreign contexts -- namely, Chile -- might be instructive here. Miguel Urquiola is a professor of economics at Columbia University. He's published extensively about Chile, which adopted a universal voucher program in the 1980s. Urquiola said that in Chile's case, public school performance -- as measured by test scores -- got "significantly" worse with the implementation of vouchers. But Urquiola cautions that the main driver behind this was likely not that public schools did a worse job. Rather, the key factor was that higher-performing students transferred in large numbers from public to private schools. "(Chile) seems to be mainly a story of affluent students and affluent families leaving the public sector," he said. On the whole, Urquiola said that vouchers had been a "disappointing" reform effort, with minor measurable effects on student performance. "School choice and the privatization of schools are fun things to argue about. But in terms of real effects they are a bit of a red herring," he said. "The evidence indicates that -- perhaps surprisingly -- such reforms do not make education really good; they do not make it really bad either." As for the research on competitive effects of school choice policies in general -- vouchers, tax-credit scholarships, and charters all together -- the jury is still out, said David Arsen, a professor of education policy and K-12 educational administration at Michigan State University. "The research is mixed. For the most part the competitive effects of school choice are modest. Sometimes positive. Sometimes negative. Sometimes no effect at all," he said. Arsen, who wrote a review of the literature on the competitive effects of choice back in 2012, warned against making "broad, generic claims about the competitive effect." "Because it depends. Most particularly it depends on details of policy design," he said. Our ruling In urging the passage of a New Hampshire bill to establish education savings accounts, Jeb Bush said "when public schools face increased competition, they get better and kids learn more." Some research shows positive gains in public schools when choice is offered, but researchers say those studies typically only show minor effects, and that the specifics of the programs matter a lot. In Florida and Ohio, where vouchers were targeted to certain types of students, researchers found minor improvements in public school performance. In Chile, where vouchers were universally available, public school test scores got worse. But Bush cited "a large body of research," and ESA programs like the ones being proposed in New Hampshire have only very recently been implemented in Arizona and Nevada, and haven’t been studied. To imply that competition will lift all boats -- especially in the context of this legislative proposal -- isn’t supported by the research. We rate this claim Mostly False.

Nathan Deal made a claim on his Twitter page that initially had us stumped. "Spending of government money is 17 percent less than it was a decade ago," the message said as Deal delivered his State of the State address. Isn’t the state budget larger than it was a decade ago? In fiscal year 2003, which began July 1, 2002, and ended June 30, 2003, then-Gov. Sonny Perdue and the Legislature approved a $16.2 billion general fund spending plan. In the proposed fiscal year 2014 budget, Deal wants to spend about $17.4 billion for the state’s general fund. The entire proposed state budget would be about $19.8 billion. Deal explained the decrease in his speech. "Using 2012 dollars, our per capita spending of government money is 17 percent less that it was a decade ago," the governor said. Adjusted for inflation, the fiscal year 2003 budget would now be $20.15 billion. The difference between that budget and Deal’s proposed budget is about $3 billion, a 17 percent decrease.

But we can't resist using our Flip-O-Meter to record such a complete reversal of position. Arlen Specter, the senior senator from Pennsylvania, was a moderate Republican, and one of only three Republican senators to vote for the economic stimulus bill that passed in February 2009. But many moderates in Pennsylvania have jumped ship. In the 2008 election, about 200,000 Pennsylvania Republicans became Democrats, many so they could vote in the hotly contested Democratic primary between Barack Obama and Sen. Hillary Clinton. This meant that as Specter looked to re-election next year, his prospects for beating a more conservative challenger — Pat Toomey, a former congressman who headed the free-market, antitax Club for Growth — were looking pretty bad. Yet Specter had ruled out switching parties, until ... Well, let's look at the evidence. Specter, in an interview with The Hill on March 17, 2009: "I'm staying a Republican because I think I have a more important role to play there," he said. "I think each of the 41 Republican senators, in a sense — and I don’t want to overstate this — is a national asset," he said, "because if one was gone, you'd only have 40, the Democrats would have 60, and they would control all of the mechanisms of government." Specter, in a news conference on April 28, 2009: "In the course of the last several months since the stimulus vote, I have traveled the state and surveyed the sentiments of the Republican Party in Pennsylvania and public opinion polls, observed other public opinion polls, and have found that the prospects for winning the Republican primary are bleak. I am not prepared to have my 29-year record in the United States Senate decided by the Pennsylvania Republican primary electorate ... . But I'm prepared today take on all comers — all comers — in a general election. And therefore, I have decided to be a candidate for re-election in 2010 in the Democratic primary."

pomt-04505	Romney’s Medicare plan was estimated to "cost the average senior about $6,000 a year."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/oct/04/barack-obama/obama-said-romneys-plan-could-cost-future-retirees/	Viewers of the first presidential debate got a heavy dose of Mediscare politics. Mitt Romney attacked President Barack Obama for"cutting $716 billion from the program," which mostly covers seniors’ health care expenses. Obama attacked Romney for supporting a "voucher"-like model to reform Medicare. At one point, Obama stared straight into the camera and told certain viewers to listen up. "If you're 54 or 55, you might want to listen 'cause this, this will affect you," he said during the Oct. 3, 2012, debate at the University of Denver. "The idea, which was originally presented by Congressman (Paul) Ryan, your running mate, is that we would give a voucher to seniors and they could go out in the private marketplace and buy their own health insurance. "The problem is that because the voucher wouldn't necessarily keep up with health care inflation, it was estimated that this would cost the average senior about $6,000 a year." Obama and other Democrats, including Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius, have invoked premium hikes somewhere in the neighborhood of $6,000 before. We’ve quibbled with it because the figure is rooted in a study of an outdated Medicare plan by Ryan, the House budget chairman from Wisconsin. Ryan released his initial Medicare plan in early 2011, and Democrats have attacked it as harmful to seniors ever since. Under this first version of the plan, Medicare would have changed from a program that pays doctors and hospitals fees for particular services to one in which beneficiaries would be paid an amount by the government that they could use toward private insurance premiums. Critics said those who fell under the new rules would face an increasingly large gap between what the government paid for their benefits and what their health care services cost. This plan passed the GOP-led House but died in the Senate. Ryan has offered updated versions of the plan, the most recent being part of his fiscal year 2013 budget proposal. It still offers seniors a defined amount toward private insurance rather than paying providers directly. But there are two big differences between the new plan and the earliest one: The newer version allows beneficiaries under 55 a choice of using their payment to buy private insurance or a plan that acts like traditional Medicare. The amount of their payment would be set by the price of the second-cheapest plan. Romney indicated in an August interview that he supports Ryan’s most recent plan. The Democrats have cited as evidence for their claims of the Romney-Ryan plan’s increased out-of-pocket costs a report by the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a liberal think tank. This 2011 report relied on analysis from the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office that found the difference of out-of-pocket office costs between the Ryan plan ($12,500, in 2022) and traditional Medicare ($6,150) to be $6,350. The problem with Obama using this estimate is simple: The CBO analysis was of the original Ryan plan, not the more recent one that Romney supports. Ryan has not yet asked for a more thorough analysis of his latest proposal. Ryan’s current plan caps overall growth in Medicare spending, but it’s also a little more generous in how fast it allows subsidies to grow as health care costs increase. Ryan also made a number of other technical changes to address concerns that the credits wouldn’t keep up if medical costs kept going up and up. As we said earlier, the amount a beneficiary receives would be based on the second least-expensive plan available on a Medicare exchange. The Obama campaign pointed us to an Oct. 2, 2012, memo from David Cutler, a Harvard economist who advised Obama’s 2008 campaign. Cutler’s memo summarizes an August 2012 analysis he co-authored for the liberal Center for American Progress regarding Romney-Ryan’s new Medicare plan. "Overall, these results confirm the view that even under the revised voucher proposal, the additional cost to enroll in Medicare for the vast bulk of people will be $6,000 annually or more," Cutler’s memo states. Still, absent details from the Ryan camp and an updated CBO analysis, it’s not clear what would happen over time if the new, market-based payments grew faster than the Ryan plan’s cap on Medicare spending. Would savings still come from beneficiaries? Or providers? Or somewhere else? Competing claims about its financial impact on seniors remain speculative. Obama is repeating a number about an old Republican plan because there isn’t an updated analysis of the new plan, which contains significant differences. We rate this claim Half True.

Barack Obama said no."	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/may/01/hillary-clinton/clinton-and-obama-differ-on-freeze/	A new Hillary Clinton ad highlights sharp differences between Obama and Clinton on gas taxes and housing. "When the housing crisis broke, Hillary Clinton called for action -- a freeze on foreclosures. Barack Obama said no. "Now, gas prices are skyrocketing, and she's ready to act again. Hillary's plan: Use the windfall profits of the oil companies to pay to suspend the gas tax this summer. Barack Obama says no, again." We looked at Obama's position on a gas tax holiday previously . He does oppose it, calling it an expensive, short-term fix with little impact for consumers or national energy policy. On housing, Clinton wants lenders to freeze foreclosures for 90 days on owner-occupied homes purchased with subprime mortgages. She wants lenders to freeze interest rates on subprime loans for owner-occupied homes for five years, or until homeowners can refinance. She wants to create a $30-billion fund for states to deal with the effects of foreclosures, everything from helping individual homeowners pay their bills to making up lost property tax revenues for police and firefighters. Clinton believes lenders should voluntarily embrace the freezes she suggests as a means of preventing widespread defaults. She would not impose the freezes through the force of law. Obama, on the other hand, opposes interest-rate freezes and a foreclosure freeze. He and his advisers have said that across-the-board freezes on foreclosures and interest rates are short-term fixes. The measures could end up doing more harm than good if lenders decide to raise interest rates on new homeowners to make up their losses, the campaign has said. He favors a $10 billion fund that would help homeowners avoid foreclosures. He also proposes reforms to bankruptcy court that would allow judges to modify mortgage terms. Of course, Clinton's ad doesn't explain any of that. But it's not wrong when it says that Obama opposes the foreclosure freeze. We find her statement True.

pomt-11622	Says under her leadership, "Democrats fought to ... make sure the (2011 HOPE) bill ... prevented the use of ACT/SAT testing standards."	half-true	/georgia/statements/2018/jan/24/stacey-abrams/georgia-governors-race-hope-scholarship-abrams/	Democratic gubernatorial candidate Stacey Abrams has taken some heat for co-sponsoring a 2011 bill to revamp the HOPE higher education aid program. Critics of the former House minority leader say she cut a deal that hurt poor and minority students. The Abrams campaign rejected the charge. "Under Abrams’ leadership, Democrats fought to prevent certain cuts and make sure the bill included funding for remedial classes at technical colleges, a 1 percent low interest loan program, and prevented the use of ACT/SAT testing standards that would have harmed poor students and students of color," spokeswoman Caitlin Highland wrote in an email Jan. 17. A key point of contention centers on the role of standardized test scores in the aid program. In this fact-check, we looked at whether Abrams prevented the use of ACT/SAT testing standards in setting eligibility for scholarships. A program called HOPE HOPE stands for Helping Outstanding Pupils Educationally and dates from 1992. It was one of the country’s earliest merit-based state aid programs. Over the years, it reached hundreds of thousands of students and provided billions of dollars in assistance. Until 2011, it had two basic streams: HOPE grants defrayed costs for attending technical colleges, and HOPE scholarships covered the full-tuition, plus books and other fees, for people working on two-year associate’s and four-year bachelor’s degrees. In 2011, costs were outstripping proceeds from the Georgia state lottery that funded the program. The state’s newly elected governor, Republican Nathan Deal, moved to trim the spending. A bipartisan bill In February 2011, flanked by lawmakers including Abrams, Deal unveiled a plan for HOPE. Among its many measures, it created two tiers in the scholarship awards part of the HOPE program – one for the best students and one for good but not exceptional ones. The original full-tuition HOPE scholarship was renamed the Zell Miller scholarship in honor of the former U.S. senator and governor. It significantly racheted up the eligibility requirements. Aimed at high performers, the Zell Miller scholarship program was limited to students with a 3.7 grade point average and a combined score of at least 1200 for the critical reading and math sections on the SAT or a 26 ACT score. The original HOPE scholarship remained in name, but the bill made it less generous. Instead of full tuition, it provided support that approached 90 percent of tuition, and it no longer covered books and other costs. Unlike the Zell Miller award for elite scholars, the HOPE scholarship remained free of a standardized test score requirement. As before, students were eligible if they had at least a 3.0 grade point average. Test scores on the table Did Abrams actually save the HOPE scholarship program from a standardized test requirement? Abrams’ communications director Priyanka Mantha told us Abrams did. "The original Republican proposal sought to impose testing requirements on students who wished to receive the scholarship, in order to narrow eligibility," Mantha said. "But under her leadership, the scholarship retained an eligibility tier without testing requirements because such tests would have disproportionately disqualified low-income students and students of color." There is no hard data on the discussions that took place behind closed doors, but an Atlanta Journal Constitution article from that time said the test score idea was in play. The news report listed eight suggestions. One of them was "require high school graduates to earn a minimum SAT/ACT score to be eligible." Mantha said the creation of the Zell Miller scholarship with a test score requirement was the result of Abrams’ intervention. "The two tiers of the HOPE program are the crux of the compromise she achieved," Mantha said. "Students who may have been eliminated from eligibility under the GOP proposal instead retained access to a version of the HOPE scholarship." Ben George, chief of staff to the Senate Minority Leader in 2011, said his boss and other Democrats were not part of the discussions and were "caught completely off-guard" by the deal with the governor. The fallout from 2011 As part of the 2011 bill, lawmakers raised the grade average for the HOPE grant for technical colleges from 2.0 to 3.0. According to a report from the Georgia Budget and Policy Institute, a liberal-leaning study center, full-time enrollment in the state’s technical college system fell "nearly 25 percent between 2011 and 2012." In 2013, lawmakers rolled back the hike in the grade average. Other changes, however, remained in place, including pulling back the amount of HOPE grant and scholarship aid. That made it harder for lower income students to stay enrolled. After the first two years, a Wall Street Journal analysis found that students from higher income neighborhoods went from being twice as likely to secure a full-tuition scholarship to three times as likely, compared to students from lower income neighborhoods. Georgia State University told the Journal that it had to drop dozens of students for not paying tuition after their scholarship aid dropped (although most of them were able to return after the school made a special plea to donors). Our ruling Abrams said she led the fight to prevent the use of standardized test scores as part of the HOPE program. In 2011, she supported a plan to make minimum test scores part of the eligibility requirements for the full-tuition HOPE scholarship.

pomt-08472	Says Illinois gubernatorial candidate Bill Brady's first priority after winning the primary "was to sponsor a bill that would mass-euthanize sheltered dogs and cats in gas chambers."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/oct/12/pat-quinn/pat-quinn-blasts-bill-brady-sponsoring-bill-pet-eu/	Illinois is famous for its rough and tumble politics, but Gov. Pat Quinn still managed to turn heads with a new TV ad that says his Republican rival, state Sen. Bill Brady, wanted to make it easier to put pets to death. With creepy music in the background, the ad shows grainy images of dogs being forced into a chamber. As the dogs are put in, the soundtrack suggests the dogs are screeching and howling with fear. Words superimposed over the images of the dogs say, "Just two days after Bill Brady won the primary for governor, Sen. Bill Brady's first priority was to sponsor a bill that would mass-euthanize sheltered dogs and cats in gas chambers." It continues, "Bill Brady's law would undo a deal worked out over two years by veterinarians, Farm Bureau and Illinois' Humane Society." The ad cuts to shots of people with their pets denouncing the bill and Brady's role in it. "Shame on Bill Brady!" says a woman holding a fluffy white dog. "I'm a Republican, but I don't support him for the mass euthanization of animals." To check the claims in the ad, we first turned to the legislative archive for the Illinois Senate. We found the bill referenced in the ad, SB 2999. It was indeed filed on Feb. 4, 2010, two days after the Feb. 2 primary, and we confirmed that it was the first bill Brady introduced after primary day. However, the primary election results were so close that, due to recounts, it actually took until March 5 for Brady to officially be declared the winner. Brady's bill sought to amend a landmark 2009 law on euthanizations. The 2009 law was a compromise for animal-welfare advocates who had been seeking a flat-out ban on the use of gas chambers. Instead, it put more restrictions on the practice. Under the 2009 law, shelters using the gas chambers had to euthanize animals one at a time, had to provide a justification for using the gas chamber, and had to have a veterinarian present from start to finish. The new requirements were expected to sharply reduce the use of gas chambers in Illinois, because of the significant added time and expense, said Jordan Matyas, Illinois state director for the Humane Society of the United States. A lethal injection -- the most common way of euthanizing pets -- typically takes two minutes or so, rather than the 30 to 40 minutes it takes in a gas chamber. So two of the biggest reasons a shelter would want to use the gas chamber -- euthanizing many pets at once and doing it inexpensively -- were upended by the new law. In fact, Matyas said he's unaware of any gas chambers being used in Illinois today. Brady's bill, offered the following year, would have widened the options for animal shelters. His bill, which according to media reports was introduced on behalf of a constituent who works in animal control, would have lifted the one-animal-at-a-time limit. That could have made a difference in how shelters calculated whether to use gas chambers instead of injection. For instance, the chambers can be used for "fractious cats, violent dogs or other animals that may subject the staff at the animal control facility to risk of injury," said Peter S. Weber, executive director of the Illinois State Veterinary Medical Association, one of the groups that initially had supported gas chambers prior to backing the 2009 compromise bill. Our research suggests that the ad's summary of the issue is pretty accurate. But there are a couple of significant caveats that we think are worth noting. First, the ad says the bill "would mass-euthanize sheltered dogs and cats in gas chambers." Actually, the bill wouldn't mandate it, as the ad's use of the word "would" suggests, but rather allow the practice. In fact, the bill requires veterinarians "to use professional judgment" on doing single or multiple euthanizations, "taking into consideration the safety of facility staff and the most humane practices" -- a requirement that animal-welfare advocates believe would be used as a loophole, but which does appear explicitly in the bill. Second, the ad includes footage of dogs being placed into a cramped-looking metal box that, we are led to assume, is a gas chamber for putting down shelter animals. In the footage shown, we counted at least four, possibly five dogs, crammed into the same enclosure within that box. However, whether the practice shown on the footage would be allowed under Brady's bill is questionable. The Brady bill required that the euthanasia chambers "must allow for the separation of animals." Matyas' interpretation is that the chambers must be manufactured to be compatible with separated chambers, but that the separators don't have to be installed. But the wording is vague enough that no one knows for sure how that language would be interpreted. So the ad's use of footage showing dogs crammed into one chamber is justifiable, but not necessarily the only outcome. Third, we think a viewer watching the ad could come away thinking the bill is still active, and that Brady continues to back it. In fact, just days after sponsoring the measure, Brady backed off after opposition by the Humane Society of the U.S. and its allies prompted several unflattering news articles. In one Chicago Sun-Times story, Matyas was quoted saying, "I have no idea why Sen. Brady introduced a bill that would allow as many animals as you want to be put into a gas chamber and they’d be exposed to one another. Under his legislation, you could have 10 dogs in one box, gasping for air, at the same time fighting, at the same time fearing for their lives." A Quad City Times story quoted Brady explaining his decision to back off. "It’s not ready," Brady said. "And the political games were distracting from the discussion." Ultimately, on March 3, John O. Jones, the state senator who became sponsor of the bill after Brady dropped out, tabled the measure. So the bill has been moot for more than half a year. The Brady campaign told us the ad gets the timing wrong because of the long delay in settling the election. Indeed, by the time Brady was officially declared the winner, Brady had disassociated from the bill and it had been tabled by its new sponsor. So where does this leave us? Quinn's stark ad is right that the bill was sponsored two days after the primary but it incorrectly suggests that it was Brady's first act after winning. Quinn is close on the substance of what the bill would have done. But the ad oversteps somewhat in suggesting that the bill would have required mass euthanizations, rather than just allowing them, and it glosses over the fact that Brady dropped his sponsorship and that the bill has been moot for most of this year. On balance, we rate the claim Half True.	None	Pat Quinn	None	None	None	2010-10-12T18:49:57	2010-09-30	['Bill_Brady_(politician)']

pomt-10389	Obama couldn't have afforded his home without Rezko's help.	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/jun/17/republican-national-committee-republican/theres-no-"gotcha"-here/	In the immediate wake of the conviction of Antoin "Tony" Rezko, a prominent former fundraiser for Sen. Barack Obama, on federal charges of fraud and money laundering, the Republican National Committee put out a news release that raises questions about whether Obama has profited from his relationship with Rezko. "Could Obama have afforded his home without Rezko's help?" the release asks. Obama and his wife, Michelle, purchased a century-old mansion from a Chicago doctor in 2005 for $1.65-million. On the same day the Obamas closed on their house, Rezko's wife, Rita Rezko, bought a vacant lot next door from the same seller, at the full asking price. While the lots were being sold separately, and the seller has confirmed that the Obamas got no discount from Rezko purchasing the lot next door, the GOP news release suggests Obama flip-flopped on the issue of whether he could afford to buy the vacant lot purchased by Rezko. "Obama originally said that he could not afford to purchase the parcel of land Rezko's wife purchased and that the house itself was already a stretch." "But Obama later said that he did not need help purchasing 'both or either of the tracts' of land involved in the purchase of his Chicago home." The first statement is accurate. It comes from an interview Obama had with the Chicago Tribune, published Nov. 1, 2006: "It was 'already a stretch' to buy the house, Obama said, so the vacant lot was not affordable for his family." The second quote is based on a Time magazine reporter asking Obama for a March 6, 2008, story: "Did you generally or expressively state a need for help in buying both or either of the tracts?" Obama: "No, I didn't need help." This answer isn't the clear contradiction it's made out to be. Obama was not asked if he could afford to buy both of the tracts, he was asked if he ever told Rezko that he needed help buying both or either of the tracts. In an interview with the Chicago Sun-Times in March 2008, Obama said the sellers had originally sought to sell the house together with the vacant lot next door, but when the property sat on the market for a long time, they decided to separate the lots. The second vacant lot was big enough to be developed. So by the time the Obamas first saw the house, it was being marketed separately. Obama has consistently said that he only ever pursued the purchase of the home, not the lot. In that context, he would have had no reason to tell Rezko he couldn't afford both lots. And with his recent book advances, he apparently had the money to buy the house without Rezko's help. (His 2005 financial disclosure form states that he received $378,239 in book royalties; and $847,167 in a book advance.) His answer to Time appears to reflect that. The GOP appears to be parsing words in hopes of scoring a "gotcha" that just isn't there. We rate the statement False.

pomt-08582	A $300 million stimulus allocation to Wisconsin "has led to the creation of tens of thousands of jobs in every corner of this state."	false	/wisconsin/statements/2010/sep/26/tom-nelson/tom-nelson-says-initial-stimulus-allocation-create/	If you want to incite lively conversation during halftime of your next Packer party, ask how many jobs have been created by the federal stimulus. Let’s just say that opinions differ -- widely -- on how effective the stimulus has been. If your party-goers include Tom Nelson, the Democratic nominee for lieutenant governor, he might chime in before anyone reached for another cheese curd. "I have a track record of dealing with tough budgets as a vehicle, as a means to get people back to work," Nelson said in a radio interview that aired a week before his Sept. 14 primary win. "And we were one of the first states in the country to pass and to implement a statewide stimulus that has led to the creation of tens of thousands of jobs in every corner of this state." That’s a lot of new jobs. Nelson, the majority leader of the state Assembly, used the term "statewide stimulus." But he told PolitiFact Wisconsin he meant the federal stimulus money that was distributed throughout the state. More specifically, Nelson said he was referring in the radio interview to the 2009 Wisconsin Act 2. That law, which Nelson voted for, was adopted in February 2009 by three-vote margins in both the Assembly and the Senate. It was a budget-adjustment measure that also directed an initial $300 million in federal stimulus funds to the state Department of Transportation. The money was for 47 projects, mostly on highways and freeways. So, for Nelson’s "tens of thousands" of jobs statement to be correct, that $300 million would have to have created at least 20,000 jobs. Did it? From the beginning, stimulus job-count figures have been beset with problems, in Wisconsin and around the country. The Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, for example, found that an October 2009 report by the White House -- claiming stimulus money created or saved more than 10,000 jobs in Wisconsin -- was rife with errors, double counting and inflated numbers. In January 2010, the White House abandoned its method of counting jobs "created or saved." Instead, it began labeling jobs as having been funded by stimulus dollars. That isn’t to say the stimulus has not had any effect. A July 2010 paper by two economists -- one from the public sector and one rom the private -- said stimulus spending created 2.7 million jobs. But Nelson’s claim was not about all stimulus money, just that initial gush of cash given to the DOT. Nelson said he based his jobs statement on "talking points," which he later said were based on two sources: The state website that tracks federal stimulus spending, which says 63,000 jobs have been created or saved. A November 2009 news release from state Rep. Mark Pocan (D-Madison), which cites two statements about new jobs. One statement, from a contractors group and three unions, referred to a study that said the 2009 state budget would create more than 25,000 jobs. The other statement, from a transportation builders group, predicted the state budget and "remaining federal stimulus dollars will support" more than 28,500 jobs. But Nelson is mixing apples and oranges. The first talking point refers to jobs created or saved, when Nelson’s comment referred only to jobs created. What’s more, the 63,000 figure is based on all stimulus money given to the state as of August 2010, not the initial $300 million Nelson originally cited. The second talking point moves everything to a different source. It claims the state budget -- not stimulus money -- would create the jobs cited. Or the budget and remaining stimulus money. Again, Nelson is off point. There are hard numbers -- rather than predictions -- that Nelson could have used to gauge the effect of the $300 million given to DOT. PolitiFact Wisconsin analyzed figures from Recovery.gov, the federal website that tracks stimulus funds. The latest data available show that, through the first half of 2010, the $300 million cited by Nelson funded 1,203 jobs. There’s no way to know how many were created and how many were saved. But that’s miles away from Nelson’s original claim. OK, almost time for the second half kickoff. Where does all of this leave us? Nelson stated that an initial $300 million in stimulus money for road projects created tens of thousands of jobs in Wisconsin. As evidence, he turns to much broader measures -- jobs created or saved, all stimulus spending, the state budget and stimulus money. But the actual jobs figure from the initial allotment barely exceeds 1,200 -- and even that is a mix of jobs created and jobs saved. We rate Nelson’s statement False.

pomt-15238	"This is the most generous country in the world when it comes to immigration. There are a million people a year who legally immigrate to the United States."	mostly true	/florida/statements/2015/aug/06/marco-rubio/rubio-america-most-generous-when-it-comes-legal-im/	When U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida addressed the topic of immigration during the first Republican debate, he portrayed our country as the leading repository of legal immigrants. "This is the most generous country in the world when it comes to immigration," Rubio said Aug. 6. "There are a million people a year who legally immigrate to the United States and people feel like we are being taken advantage of." Rubio went on to talk about people who call his office in frustration as they wait years to come to the United States legally. Statements about illegal immigration by Rubio, former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush and businessman Donald Trump were hot topics during the debate. Here, we will fact-check whether Rubio got his figure right, and we will explain what he means about the United States being the "most generous in the world when it comes to immigration." Legal immigration Rubio’s stance on how to change immigration laws has been a hot topic since 2013 since Rubio and seven other senators crafted bipartisan legislation that passed the Senate. The bill included a pathway to citizenship for certain illegal immigrants, though one with significant hurdles. But the House wasn’t interested in that approach, and after that died, Rubio said he still favored changing immigration law through piecemeal bills. In May, Rubio said at the National Review Forum that "We have a legal immigration system in America that accepts 1 million people a year, legally. No other country in the world even comes close to that." As we explained in our earlier fact-check, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security keeps track of the number of new legal permanent residents a year, and in 2013 it was just shy of 1 million at 990,553. Of the 2013 number, about 46 percent were new arrivals, and about 54 percent were people already in the United States whose status was upgraded to "permanent." As for how the United States stacks up against other countries in terms of legal immigration, we turned to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. Formed in 1961, the OECD collects data on a wide range of topics, including immigration. We looked at the data in two ways for 2013: First, the sheer number of legal immigrants and secondly, the number of new immigrants as a percentage of the population. OECD standardizes the data from various countries to make them comparable with those in the United States. That process aims to count only permanent residents and exclude other categories such as seasonal workers or students. When we fact-checked Rubio’s claim in May, the OECD was in the process of standardizing the data for 2013, but expected the United States to be in the top spot for the sheer number of immigrants with nearly 1 million immigrants. Provisional figures by OECD showed that Germany had 466,000 while the United Kingdom had 291,000. In per capita rates,the United States placed 19th out of 24 countries. That means that the United States received fewer immigrants per capita in 2012-13 compared with several European countries, New Zealand, Australia and Canada. Our ruling Rubio said, "This is the most generous country in the world when it comes to immigration. There are million people a year who legally immigrate to the United States." Rubio got his number correct: Nearly 1 million legal immigrants came to the United States in 2013, according to data from the federal government. In terms of sheer numbers, that puts the United States ahead of other countries, but not in terms of a percentage of the population. We rate this claim Mostly True.

pomt-04143	AIG has fully repaid the federal government "plus a profit of more than $22 billion."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2013/jan/02/american-international-group/aig-says-it-has-repaid-government-plus-profit/	New Year’s Day football watchers got a heavy dose of rah, rah from AIG, the big insurance company that was bailed out by federal taxpayers. An ad called "Thank You, America" featured scenes from Hurricane Sandy, tornado-ravaged Joplin, Mo., and the World Trade Center — disasters the company insured — with the message: We paid you back. AIG has repaid "everything, plus a profit of more than $22 billion," an employee in the ad says. Text on the screen soon flashes: "$205 billion, paid to America from AIG." You’ll see the ad over the next two weeks as you watch sports, news and the Golden Globes. We thought you might wonder: Is that true? Did the company pay back its loans plus a profit? Final stock sale Back in 2008, AIG was in deep trouble. AIG Financial Products had invested heavily in complicated financial instruments called credit default swaps. As financial journalist Michael Lewis put it in his book The Big Short, AIG became, essentially, the world’s biggest owner of subprime mortgage bonds. When those bonds turned out to be dangerously hollow, the financial world unraveled. Bear Stearns failed, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac collapsed and Lehman Bros. went bankrupt. After markets reacted badly to the Lehman bankruptcy, the Federal Reserve and Treasury Department decided to rescue AIG. Offering $182 billion to stabilize the company, the federal government became its largest stockholder. Two years ago, the Treasury held 92 percent of AIG’s common stock — more than a billion and a half shares. The company made significant changes, including slashing bad investments made by AIG Financial Products, the division that oversaw the controversial credit default swaps. The federal government gradually sold its stake. Last month, the Treasury sold the last shares for an overall "positive return" of $22.7 billion. Andrew Ross Sorkin, a New York Times columnist and author of Too Big to Fail, called AIG the "turnaround of the year." Still, the New York Times editorial board and critics of the bailout point out that amount doesn’t take into account tax breaks the company got as part of the deal. Former members of an oversight panel said in March that a special tax exemption offered by the Treasury in 2008 amounted to a "stealth bailout." It allowed AIG to count net operating losses against future tax bills, which "some estimate has contributed to $17.7 billion in profits for the company," according to the group of former oversight panelists, including chair Elizabeth Warren, now a Democratic senator from Massachusetts. So, have the government’s loans been repaid, with a "positive return" of $22 billion for taxpayers? Yes. Was the entire U.S. bailout of AIG, including special tax provisions, that profitable? No. Our ruling AIG says it honored its commitment to repay the government, plus a profit of more than $22 billion. It's true that the government has recouped the $182 billion it loaned AIG, plus $22.7 billion. Still, critics have a point that a special tax provision granted to aid the struggling company substantially offsets that "profit." We rate the company’s claim Mostly True.

pomt-02627	In 2011, Carlos López-Cantera "staunchly supported" a Florida bill modeled after Arizona’s immigration law	mostly false	/florida/statements/2014/jan/21/democratic-hispanic-caucus-florida-miami-dade-coun/democratic-hispanic-group-says-carlos-lopez-canter/	Gov. Rick Scott named former House Republican leader and Miami-Dade property appraiser Carlos López-Cantera as his lieutenant governor and runningmate on Jan. 14, 2014. López-Cantera was born in Spain to Cuban parents and lives in a county with a large number of Hispanic voters. Democrats dove into López-Cantera’s past record on immigration and launched immediate attacks, including about a controversial 2011 proposal known as the Florida Immigration Enforcement Act (HB 7089). "In 2011, Lopez-Cantera staunchly supported HB 7089, the anti-immigrant bill modeled after the racial profiling Arizona law, which Rick Scott embraced during his first governor's race," said the Miami-Dade chapter of the Democratic Hispanic caucus of Florida in a Jan. 16 press release. "Lopez-Cantera called it a ‘common sense’ and ‘reasonable’ bill in a press release on March 10, 2011." The Florida Democratic Party launched a similar attack. We wanted to know, did López-Cantera "staunchly support" House Bill 7089? López-Cantera’s comments about an Arizona-style law in 2010 During his Republican primary in 2010, Scott vowed to bring an Arizona-style law to Florida. "Rick Scott backs Arizona’s law; he'll bring it to Florida and let our police check if the people they arrest are here legally. That’s common sense," his campaign said. Signed into law by Arizona Gov. Jan Brewer in 2010, that law requires police who stop a person to verify their immigration status if they reasonably suspect the person of being in the country illegally. (The U.S. Supreme Court struck down part of the law in 2012.) The law became a focal point of a hotly contested Republican primary between Scott and then Attorney General Bill McCollum as they battled for conservative voters. In May 2010, McCollum announced he would support an Arizona-style law. Though Scott strongly supported the measure as a candidate, he abandoned it once he became governor. PolitiFact Florida rated the campaign pledge a Promise Broken on our Scott-O-Meter, a database of his campaign promises. Back during the 2010 campaign, the Miami Herald interviewed Hispanic legislators, including López-Cantera, about McCollum’s support for the Arizona law. "As far as I’m concerned, I don’t think Florida has a problem like Arizona does," López-Cantera said. "I realize there’s a problem in Arizona. They have a serious problem, but I don't think you can compare it to Florida." In August 2010, López-Cantera told the Tampa Bay Times: "I am concerned that this could jeopardize civil liberties." The topic of immigration reform remained a concern for López-Cantera after Scott won the primary, and it appeared the two had a conversation about it. "I asked about the issue going forward, and he (Scott) said immigration is an issue, but the more pressing one is jobs and the economy," López-Cantera told the Miami Herald in September 2010. Immigration bills during 2011 session López-Cantera served as the state House majority leader and would have to deal with a range of Republican viewpoints on immigration reform: both hardliners who wanted a crackdown and some Hispanic lawmakers and constituents who viewed such a push as anti-Hispanic. During the 2011 session, legislators introduced the Florida Immigration Enforcement Act as HB 7089 and a similar bill in the Senate, SB 2040. The bills were not identical to Arizona’s law, but for immigrant advocates it raised fears that it would increase racial profiling. Some business-backed groups also raised concerns because there was a component that related to employers. The House bill would have required police to check the immigration status of a person subject of a criminal investigation if the police had "reasonable suspicion" the person was in the country illegally. Also, employers would be required to check workers’ immigration status. The Senate counterpart didn’t go as far and only let police police check the status of an inmate -- not a person only under investigation -- and it gave some wiggle room to employers. In March 2011, the House judiciary committee passed the bill 12-6. López-Cantera, Miami-Dade’s delegation chair, wasn’t a member of that committee. But in his press release after the vote he spoke positively about the law but didn’t specifically state how he would vote on it: "Chairman Snyder and the Judiciary Committee recognize the unique and diverse history of our state and have worked hard to bring all stakeholders to the table to produce this piece of common sense, Florida immigration reform. This legislation is designed to preserve employment opportunities for Floridians through the use of the E-Verify system. "The bill does not require law enforcement officers to ask individuals for immigration documentation during routine traffic stops. It does, however, give law enforcement officers the tools necessary to enforce the immigration laws of the United States." "I look forward to watching this reasonable and effective approach to immigration reform work its way through the legislative process." Activists opposing the bills turned up the heat and particularly targeted López-Cantera and Sen. Anitere Flores, a sponsor of the Senate bill and another Hispanic Republican from Miami-Dade. In April, left-leaning and Hispanic groups announced they would launch Spanish-language radio ads calling out the two legislators. Groups also held a protest in front of López-Cantera’s office. While the attacks were going on, the Herald reported that López-Cantera was now against the House measure and planned to vote against it as well. "Florida doesn’t need an immigration law," he said in April 2011. The Senate passed a version of the bill, but the full House never took a vote. The measure was dead by the end of the session. We asked for evidence from the Miami-Dade group that made the claim but didn’t hear back. However Joshua Karp, spokesman for the Florida Democratic Party, said there was a period of time when López-Cantera supported the bill but later flip-flopped. We were unsuccessful at getting a direct response from López-Cantera. A spokesman for the Republican Party of Florida sent us a statement arguing that Florida’s proposed bill was different from the Arizona law and repeated this line from López-Cantera’s press release: "The bill does not require law enforcement officers to ask individuals for immigration documentation during routine traffic stops." Our ruling The Democratic Hispanic Caucus of Florida’s Miami-Dade chapter that stated López-Cantera "staunchly supported" a bill modeled after Arizona’s immigration law. López-Cantera never had to take a vote on the bill, so the only evidence we can evaluate is his statements about the bill. At first, López-Cantera said he looked forward to "watching this reasonable and effective approach to immigration reform work its way through the legislative process." That’s a positive statement, but hardly "staunch" support. But as protesters turned up the heat on López-Cantera, he became decidedly opposed, saying "Florida doesn’t need an immigration law."

pomt-14045	"Vietnamese is the third most commonly spoken language in Texas."	true	/texas/statements/2016/may/26/john-cornyn/john-cornyn-says-vietnamese-third-most-common-lang/	John Cornyn recently stressed that Communist Vietnam, visited by President Barack Obama, needs to improve its human rights record. Cornyn opened his Senate floor remarks, though, by calling Vietnamese residents of his home state of Texas "some of the most accomplished people." The second-term Republican added: "Many are surprised when I tell them that Vietnamese is the third most commonly spoken language in Texas." English is most-spoken, Cornyn told his colleagues, with Spanish ranking No. 2. Makes sense. But we wondered about his Vietnamese language claim. By email, Cornyn spokesman Drew Brandewie told us Cornyn reached his conclusion based on U.S. Census bureau charts on languages spoken at home posted in October 2015. By far, according to the bureau’s 2009-2013 American Community Survey, English and Spanish were most-spoken at home in Texas--and Vietnamese placed a distant third, . Brandewie also noted news accounts that cited the bureau data including a November 2015 Texas Tribune story. A chart with the Tribune story presents the state’s most-spoken languages other than English under this summary: "Of the nearly 24 million people in Texas five years or older, 65 percent speak only English at home. The rest speak more than 160 languages combined." Top 10 languages other than English spoken in Texas households Language Number of Speakers Spanish 6,983,380 Vietnamese 193,408 Chinese* 140,971 Tagalog 72,248 German 69,140 French 60,730 Hindi 59,602 Urdu 57,662 Korean 55,794 Arabic 55,304 *Includes Cantonese, Mandarin other Chinese languages SOURCES: News story, " As Texas Grows, More Languages are Spoken at Home," Texas Tribune, Nov. 26, 2015, chart citing 2009-2013 American Community Survey. Some 164 languages are lately spoken in Texas, the story said. Significantly, it said, changing "immigration patterns are increasing the number of other foreign languages spoken in Texas households, from Vietnamese and Chinese to Tagalog, the language spoken in the Philippines." 2014 census data Seeking the latest available data, we reached out to bureau spokesman Robert Bernstein who emailed us a breakdown drawing on results from the 2014 one-year ACS indicating that some 201,997 Texas residents age 5 or older speak Vietnamese at home. That count trailed only the 2014 survey’s tally of English-only speakers in Texas (16,126,855) and Spanish speakers (7,465,279). Some perspective; 65 percent of the estimated 25 million Texans age 5 or older speak only English at home, according to the survey, and 30 percent speak Spanish--while only 0.81 percent speak Vietnamese. That is, there’s a big dropoff from second to third place. Bernstein also provided national results on languages spoken at home. According to the 2014 ACS, 79 percent of the 299 million U.S. residents 5 or older speak only English, 13 percent speak Spanish and, in third place, about 5.5 percent speak French. Next, per the survey, 1 percent of residents speak Chinese at home with 0.5 percent, nearly 1.5 million residents, speaking Vietnamese. Longer view We also heard back from Lloyd Potter, the state demographer, who noted by email that according to the ACS covering 2010-2014, English, Spanish and Vietnamese were the three most-spoken languages in Texas. Those were followed, the five-year results suggest, by Chinese, other Asian languages, African languages, Tagalog, German, French and Urdu. Our ruling Cornyn said Vietnamese is the third-most-spoken language in Texas. Survey data supports this claim though English or Spanish is spoken by far more residents. We rate the claim True.

pomt-07561	"Originally, Democrats promised that if you liked your health care plan, you could keep it. One year later we know that you need a waiver to keep your plan."	mostly false	/virginia/statements/2011/mar/31/morgan-griffith/morgan-griffith-says-you-need-waiver-keep-your-hea/	U.S. Rep. Morgan Griffith is on the long list of Republicans who observed the first anniversary of the health-care reform law by firing out a scathing statement. Griffith, who represents the 9th Congressional District in Southwest Virginia, said in a March 25 newsletter that Americans were misled about the bill. "Originally, Democrats promised that if you liked your health-care plan, you could keep it," Griffith wrote. "One year later we know that you need a waiver to keep your plan." We gave his statement a checkup. Roughly 160 million Americans get health insurance through employee benefits, and millions more buy it on the private market, according to Tim Jost, a law professor at Washington and Lee University and a consumer advocate for the National Association of Insurance Commissioners. Our research turned up no evidence of blanket waivers being required by the government. But experts did tell us Uncle Sam was issuing some waivers for limited-benefit plans and coverages that were not meeting a new requirement to spend at least 80 percent of premiums on health benefits rather than administrative or other costs. Beth Breeding, Griffith’s press secretary, confirmed that Griffith’s comments refer primarily to the limited-benefit, or "mini-med" plans popular at huge employers with lots of part-time or low-wage workers. Two of the largest users are Wal-Mart and McDonalds. These policies often have annual limits on on total payouts. Jost said the caps can be as low $2,000. The new law bars annual benefit limits, starting in 2014. The ban will be phased in over the next three years, allowing benefit caps of $750,000 in 2011, $1.25 million in 2012 and $2 million in 2013. But the health-care reform law provides an out for plans that can’t meet these new limits without jacking up premiums. If an insurer can convince regulators that the new caps would cause premiums on a plan to soar, regulators can issue a waiver. During the first two months of this year, 1,040 waivers were issued for limited-benefit plans covering 2.6 million workers, according to the the Department of Health and Human Services. That’s roughly 1.6 percent of the employees with health care coverage. Jost believes virtually every mini-med plan in America has sought a waiver. "These waivers include some pretty good plans with $250,000 or $500,000 annual limits that just can’t quite get to the threshold," Jost said. "Some offer pretty decent coverage, and some offer virtually nothing." Michael Tanner, a senior fellow at the libertarian Cato Institute, said mini-med plans are expected to all but vanish by 2014. He said the government predicts many businesses will bring their plans into compliance with new standards, even though it will likely force businesses to spend more. But Tanner stressed that most companies and their employees will not go through a waiver process. "That’s just not the case now," Tanner said. During the health care debate, President Barack Obama promised Americans would be able to keep their plans, if they like them. PolitiFact rated that statement Half True, because while many elements of the health care system will not change, private companies retain the right to switch and tweak their health care plans. Many do so now, and they will continue to do so after 2014. When Obama later said nothing in the law will force most employers to change plans, the statement was rated True. While employers retain the right to change plans, they are not, in most cases, required to do. So here’s our final diagnosis. Griffith wrote in a column excoriating insurance provisions in the health care reform law that "you need a waiver to keep your plan." His press secretary told us the congressman was only talking about limited-benefit plans, although Griffith made no such distinction in his writing. About 2.6 million Americans are covered by limited-benefit plans. That’s a tiny percentage of the 160 million people who have employer-sponsored health coverage, and millions more who have other forms of coverage. Contrary to what Griffith said, very few Americans will need a waiver to keep their health-care plan. We rate his statement Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.

pomt-00692	Says the Clintons "burst through their own self-pronounced guidelines" by accepting foreign donations. "There is a clip of Bill Clinton saying we're not going to take foreign donations."	mostly false	/punditfact/statements/2015/may/04/joe-scarborough/scarborough-clinton-foundation-broke-its-own-rules/	A 2012 Q&A session between Bill Clinton and Ashley Judd has surfaced as evidence in the case against the Clinton Foundation and its acceptance of foreign donations while Hillary Clinton served as secretary of state. In the video, Clinton’s words seem hypocritical. Here’s how MSNBC host Joe Scarborough described it on his April 30, 2015, show. "There is a clip of Bill Clinton saying we're not going to take foreign donations because if somebody had business before the State Department, there would be an appearance of impropriety," Scarborough said. "They not only burst through what the guidelines of the White House put up, they burst through their own self-pronounced guidelines." Scarborough is right that there's a video clip of Clinton dicussing foreign donations, but as this fact-check will show, he misleads viewers by saying it's a sign the Clintons burst through their "self-pronounced guidelines" of taking foreign donations. What Bill Clinton said The 2012 interview took place at the London School of Economics. Clinton was asked by a fawning Judd about the creation of the Clinton Global Initiative -- which is, effectively, a subsidiary of the Clinton Foundation. Initiative projects range from paying for technology so that small stoves to charge cell phones, to loans for small businesses, to free Web ads to raise money for overseas development nonprofits. As often happens with Clinton, he gave a sidewinder of an answer. But here’s the relevant portion of his response for our purposes: "The Clinton Global Initiative meets every year. Then we do one (meeting) just on the American economy, which we will continue to do until we reach full employment. We had one (meeting) in Hong Kong for Asia, which I had to suspend those while Hillary was secretary of state for good reason. In order to do one around the world and make the economics work and keep the entry fee fairly low, you have to have sponsors. And if your wife is secretary of state and you get sponsors in another country, they may be doing it just because they believe in it, but it opens up too many questions of conflicts of interest. So we suspended those. "But if she leaves the State Department in January, then I expect we’ll have one in 2013 in Latin America and then another shortly thereafter in Asia because they’re interested in it." As you can see, Scarborough’s comments aren’t out of thin air. But Clinton is talking specifically about the Clinton Global Initiative. That’s an important distinction, it turns out, because of the specific guidelines set out by the Clintons when Hillary Clinton was nominated as secretary of state. A bevy of initiatives The Clintons (and we say Clintons to describe them as a group, but Hillary Clinton was walled off from the organizations as secretary of state) operate several separate initiatives under the umbrella of the Clinton Foundation. While Hillary Clinton ran the State Department, the foundation oversaw the Clinton HIV/AIDS Initiative, the Clinton Climate Initiative, the Clinton Guistra Sustainable Growth Initiative and the Clinton Hunter Development Initiative. (The last one had nothing to do with hunting. It was named for Scottish entrepreneur Sir Tom Hunter and focused on development projects in Rwanda and Malawi.) The foundation still runs those different programs, although it has dropped the initiative label from some of them. The point is, the Clinton Global Initiative was one of a handful of programs under the foundation’s umbrella. The modus operandi of the Clinton Global Initiative is to act as a broker between donors and doers. It holds big meetings to bring together governments, donors, and non-governmental organizations with shared concerns. The initiative charges fees to join as members, seeks sponsors to hold these big meetings and then pushes members to make big dollar commitments to key projects. Brian Mittendorf, a professor of accounting at Ohio State University’s Fisher College of Business who follows nonprofit filings, including those of the Clinton Foundation, said that most of the money never passes through the Clinton Global Initiative’s hands. "CGI (the Clinton Global Initiative) doesn't implement the projects but instead acts as a ‘facilitator’ to match donors and get commitments to action," Mittendorf said. "So, those commitments are not reflected as donations to the Clinton Foundation or CGI." To get an idea of the contrast, in 2011, the global initiative had $26 million in revenues, but boasted that it secured commitments of $7.39 billion for projects that would roll out over many years. The promises of the Clintons and the memorandum of understanding So now we get to the Clintons "self-pronounced guidelines." When Hillary Clinton was nominated by Barack Obama as secretary of state in 2008, the Clinton Foundation instantly emerged as a stumbling block to her confirmation. The Obama transition team attempted to deal with the possible conflicts of interest with a memorandum of understanding between the Clinton Foundation and the new administration. That memo created different requirements for the Clinton Global Initiative and other Clinton entities. According to the memorandum, the Clinton Global Initiative would be spun off as a separate nonprofit entity that could take no money from any foreign government. In addition, the Clinton Global Initiative agreed not to hold any big meetings outside the United States. The other Clinton programs and initiatives could continue to accept money from foreign governments, but they had to report new donors or any existing government donor that decided to "increase materially its commitment." Memorandum terms Clinton Global Initiative Memorandum terms Clinton Foundation and other Clinton subsidiaries No donations from foreign governments Can accept donations from foreign governments, increased reporting requirements No large meetings outside the United States Foreign meetings allowed This, again, is key, because Clinton was speaking only of the Clinton Global Iniative in his 2012 remarks. Clinton Foundation spokesman Craig Minassian said the global initiative was treated differently because the initiative mainly brought funders together. As such, the global initiative did not need to collect money directly from foreign governments. In contrast, Minassian said, a program like the Clinton HIV/AIDS Initiative -- now called the Clinton Health Access Initiative -- ran projects that delivered health care to people in developing countries. "You couldn’t stop the money for AIDS because millions of people depended on that for their drugs," Minassian said. "Those were programs we actually implemented. No one wanted to interrupt that because it would make no sense." So why would the Clinton Global Initiative have any need at all for funds from foreign governments? Minassian said such help made large foreign meetings possible. "You need to be invited. You need additional police and security," Minassian said. "The host country is a key sponsor. This is not like holding a meeting at the Sheraton in New York City." Minassian said that after a meeting in December 2008 in Hong Kong, the program limited its annual gatherings to New York City from 2009 to 2012, the years Hillary Clinton headed the State Department. The first meeting outside America took place about 10 months after she left. It was held December 2013 in Brazil. Foreign money did go to the Clinton Global Initiative The restriction on the global initiative applied specifically to foreign governments. However, the initiative could and did accept donations from foreign donors (Scarborough just said foreign donations, not donations from foreign governments). There are two ways to support the initiative. Membership costs $20,000 and comes with a ticket to go to the annual meeting. Sponsors pitch in substantially more to help pay for the meetings themselves. In return, they get publicity, multiple tickets to the meeting and other perks like their own meeting room at the annual gathering. The organization’s Internal Revenue Service filings show total revenues of $28.2 million in 2012 and $26 million in 2011. The split between member fees and sponsorships is unclear, but Minassian said those are the only two sources of revenues. In 2011, foundations backed by Ukrainian businessman Victor Pinchuk and Dubai-based Indian Sunny Varkey helped fund the annual meeting in New York. So did the French bank Credit Agricole and Indo Gold, an Australian mining company with investments in India, Africa and Germany. During Hillary Clinton’s confirmation hearings, senators raised concerns about any foreign entity, government or private, making donations to the Clinton Foundation. The policy for the Clinton Global Initiative that emerged from the memorandum only banned accepting funds from foreign governments, along with no longer holding large meetings outside America. Since Hillary Clinton left the State Department, the governments of Germany, Saudi Arabia, Australia, Oman, and others have given money to the global initiative. Minassian said that now that she is running for president, that will stop, as will plans to hold gatherings overseas. Our ruling Scarborough accused Bill Clinton of hypocrisy, saying the former president violated his own self-pronounced guidelines by accepting foreign donations while his wife was secretary of state. As evidence, Scarborough pointed to comments made by Clinton in 2012. But Clinton's comments were more narrowly focused than Scarborough let on. Clinton said the Clinton Global Initiative didn’t take donations from foreign entities while Hillary Clinton was secretary of state because it opens questions of conflicts of interest. That prohibition is outlined in a memorandum of understanding signed by the foundation and the Obama administration. There is, as of yet, no accusation that the initiative broke that term of the agreement. As far as the other Clinton programs and initiatives, the Clintons were permitted to collect donations from foreign governments. But they did agree to increased reporting requirements, though the Clinton Foundation says it failed to meet the reporting requirements in some cases. In short, there are serious questions about how the Clinton Foundation reported foreign government donations. But Bill Clinton’s 2012 interview provides little extra fodder -- beyond a juicy soundbyte -- for those questioning the Clintons’ decision to take foreign government money.

pomt-08559	When each faced a pension funding crisis, Tom Barrett made tough choices and smart cuts while Scott Walker passed $400 million in pension debt to the next generation.	half-true	/wisconsin/statements/2010/sep/29/tom-barrett/tom-barrett-says-gubernatorial-rival-scott-walker-/	Republican Scott Walker likes to tout his credentials as a reformer who led a people’s crusade to clean up a county government racked by pension corruption and fiscal mismanagement. His Democratic rival in the governor’s race, Milwaukee Mayor Tom Barrett, is taking aim at the heart of Walker’s white-knight appeal -- and his record as Milwaukee County executive -- in a multimedia barrage. In a statewide TV spot, buttressed by his campaign’s blog and Facebook and Twitter accounts, Barrett paints an alternate vision: A county executive who recklessly borrowed a mountain of money to help pay for those bloated county pensions. In a TV ad, Barrett says he and Walker faced the same pension funding crisis. "Under Tom Barrett, the city of Milwaukee met the crisis head on, and Barrett used smart budget cuts to help solve the problem," the ad says. "In Milwaukee County, Scott Walker borrowed $400 million -- $400 million -- and passed the pension debt on to the next generation. So who do you trust? It’s Tom Barrett who’s a straight shooter, with honest plans for Wisconsin." Barrett’s campaign website labels Walker’s borrowing "reckless" and says: "People are angry at politicians who duck the tough choices, kick the can down the road, and then pose for the holy pictures. This is precisely how Scott Walker dealt with the County pension crisis." The issue is an important -- and complicated -- one. The TV ad refers to actions in 2009, one by the city and one by the county, to shore up funding shortfalls in their employee pension funds. Milwaukee County’s dilemma stemmed from three sources. First was the mega-generous pension benefits deal for employees approved by Walker’s predecessor, Tom Ament. It was outrage over the pension deal that drove Ament from office in 2002. Second, stock market losses slammed the county’s pension fund, along with those of many other such funds. Finally, Walker and the County Board underfunded pensions by $41 million from 2004 to 2008. By late 2008, the county faced a nearly $53 million payment from its budget to the pension fund. Instead of making the payment through tax increases or budget cuts, at Walker’s urging the County Board took a borrow-and-invest approach using pension obligation bonds. The county issued $400 million in pension-related notes on March 19, 2009, a county summary of the plan shows. That partially shores up the county pension fund right now, but the county must repay the debt over 25 years. If the invested funds earn 8 percent, it could save the county $240 million. If they don’t earn at least 6.19 percent, the county could wind up paying extra. In year one, the bond deal meant the county paid in $8.5 million less than it would have without the deal. At City Hall, in the fall of 2009 Barrett faced a major pension squeeze that was largely due to the financial crisis and stock market losses. In recent years, the city’s fund had been in such good shape that no payment by the city was required. This time a $49 million contribution was required. To make the payment, Barrett and the Common Council made cuts in library service, fire ladder-truck staffing, public works laborers and others. They also raised fees and property taxes. Before we move on, there are two other things to note: First, Milwaukee County faced the exact same sized contribution as the city did -- $49 million -- in 2007. It made the payment through budget cuts and a County Board-initiated tax increase. Second, city ordinances -- unlike those governing Milwaukee County -- require officials to keep the pension fund at a level where it can pay for all future obligations. That is known as 100 percent funded. The details mentioned in Barrett’s ad are not in dispute. Beyond those details, though, is the main message: Barrett took a responsible approach, while Walker recklessly used a short-term fix that will push costs onto the next generation. Is Barrett right? Let’s start by looking more deeply at pension obligation bonds, also known as POBs, the approach Walker and the county took in 2009. Such bonds are controversial, a 2010 study by the Center for Retirement Research at Boston College notes. "Many state and local governments remain wary of these transactions," the study says. "Some view POBs as being unfair to future generations, and others see them as overly risky." Why are they considered risky? The bonds are sold to investors and the proceeds are invested, often in securities. That approach is riskier but can bring in higher yields and generate long-term savings, notes Duquesne University business professor James Burnham in his study of pension bonds. Wisconsin is one of 10 states where most of the use of pension obligation bonds has been concentrated. Given the right circumstances, they can be a useful tool for managing pension costs, experts say. The State of Wisconsin has used the approach. The Boston College study looked at every pension obligation bond issue from 1986 to 2009. It noted: "Unfortunately, in practice, the data show that governments with healthy pensions and solid fiscal positions have historically not issued POBs. Rather, the governments that issue POBs are those facing the greatest fiscal stress and thus least able to shoulder the additional risks from a POB." Milwaukee County would certainly fit that profile; numerous independent studies have detailed the county’s structural deficits. Let’s get back to the heart of Barrett’s message, and its three main critiques: 1. The county approach pushes costs onto the next generation. On the face of it, the plan does. It locks Milwaukee County into payments for 25 years in contrast to the pay-as-you-go system pensions are usually paid on. Moody’s rating service analyzed the county’s bond issue and noted that it "will increase the county’s debt burden" to well above average. The Boston College study says taxable pension bonds "transfer a current pension obligation into a long-term, fixed obligation of the government." But others say the county’s overall indebtedness isn’t really changed by the approach, because pensions are paid for on a deferred basis regardless of whether a loan is involved. The POB is just a different way to finance it, said Stephen Gauthier, director of technical services at the Government Finance Officers Association, a membership organization. As a normal practice, the county determines annually how much to contribute to the pension fund based on a 30-year amortization period, county officials note. 2. It’s a bad deal for taxpayers. On this point, it’s too soon to tell, mostly because the county’s calculated gamble is a long-term bet. Should the county’s investment returns on the $400 million badly miss the mark, the deal will be a net loser -- the pensions will cost more than they would have, said David Anderson, senior managing consultant at the PFM Group, the county’s financial adviser. But if the county meets its investment goals over 25 years, the POB deal could save more than $240 million in pension payments, county officials were told. The county took various steps to minimize the risk. It borrowed a large amount but within the range of reasonable by a standard used by Burnham, the Duquesne professor. Its timing on the bond sale was very good. The investments are off to a good start. So those are good signs. But the county skipped a $2 million payment this year to a "stabilization fund" it set up to guard against losses from the bond sale. And the county’s funding problem was so deep that even the $400 million didn’t cover the entire shortfall. The bonds covered 82 percent of it. That means the county has to make contributions on top of the debt repayments. On the cautionary side: The past performance of POBs across the country is not encouraging, the Boston College study found. The study found that "most POBs issued since 1992 are in the red." It was done after the financial crisis, which had a major effect on many pension funds, so factor that in. 3. Tom Barrett faced the same pension crisis and made tough choices and smart cuts instead of borrowing money. Were their situations really comparable? In the big picture, the county’s fund is in tougher shape. When it came to choices, Barrett had little choice but to meet the problem head-on, because the city’s charter ordinance requires that officials keep the pension fund at 100 percent funding. The county is not required to meet that threshold, so it can underfund the account today in hopes that market increases will cover the difference later. Let’s wrap this up. Everyone agrees the approach used by Scott Walker and the County Board carries inherent financial risks -- though it also has potential financial rewards. It does push costs down the road, in this case over a 25-year period, though it’s hard to say at this point whether that will be longer than the payoff without such a loan. Barrett labels the approach "reckless." In his favor, the county fits the profile of troubled municipalities that a study shows haven’t fared as well with POBs. But even critics say POBs can be useful if employed under the right circumstances. And if the return on investments meets best-case projections, it could mean $240 million in savings to the county. We won’t truly know for decades. While the pension challenge Barrett faced was real, it was a one-year wonder as crises go, unlike the county’s ongoing drama. Barrett did avoid borrowing and made cuts in some popular programs -- but he also raised taxes and fees to address it. Beyond that, under the city system Barrett essentially had no choice but to address the problem immediately. We rate the Barrett statement Half True.

pomt-07425	"Every person on death row was a foster kid."	false	/florida/statements/2011/apr/25/steve-wise/sen-stephen-wise-says-everybody-death-row-was-fost/	Here at PolitiFact Florida, we always welcome suggestions for claims worth checking. This item came to our attention via Twitter from Florida Times Union political columnist Abel Harding. "Sen. Stephen Wise: 'Every prisoner on death row was a foster kid.' Any way to check that @PolitiFact_FL?" We were up for the task. Wise's comment came during the March 30, 2011, Senate Education PreK-12 Committee hearing, during a discussion of SB 1546, a charter school expansion proposal sponsored by Sen. John Thrasher. The measure is aimed at authorizing state universities and other Florida College System schools to enter into charter school contracts with local school districts. Leslie Poole, outreach director for the Washington, D.C.-based The Seed Foundation, a nonprofit that operates two high-performing "urban boarding schools," testified before the committee about the success of the foundation's charter program. The foundation's two schools in the District of Columbia and Maryland have been featured on 60 Minutes. President Barack Obama held a bill-signing at the D.C. school in 2009, where he lauded the program as "a true success story." When asked by Wise how many children in the program came through the foster care system, Poole responded that of the D.C. school's 336 students, about one-third of them have been touched by the child welfare system. "I'll just say this to you members, so you can kind of know what the situation is in Florida," Wise said after Poole's comments."One-third of all the inmates in the State of Florida come through the foster care system. Every person on death row was a foster care kid. This is a program that will make a difference in kids' lives." (You can hear the statement on this video of the meeting posted on the state Senate website. Wise's remark is about 41 minutes into the meeting.) As of April 22, 2011, there are 393 inmates on death row, according to the Florida Department of Corrections. We were startled to hear that every one of these killers has something in common. Could it be that all of them had, at one point, been through the foster care system? We wanted to ask Wise and his legislative staff for the source of his statement. But after calling and e-mailing him and his staff for four days, we never heard back. So we started looking. State agencies and advocates • Department of Corrections: The agency responsible for death row keeps stats on the age, race and gender of death row inmates -- you can view it online -- but has nothing regarding their upbringing, said department spokeswoman Jo Ellyn Rackleff. "All we keep is documents regarding their conviction, none of which would indicate if they were in foster care," Rackleff said in a phone interview. • Florida Department of Children and Families: The agency that administers the state's foster care program says it collects no data on foster care children who wind up on death row. DCF does periodically survey adults ages 18 to 22 to determine their status after they leave foster care, and it produced a 2009 report titled "Independent Living Transitional Services." According to the report, roughly 9 percent of 1,500 respondents between the ages of 18 and 22 said they had been incarcerated within the past 12 months. "We do know that kids who have been in the foster care system have a higher risk of being arrested, but whether or not they end up on death row, that's too specific to know," said Diane Hirth, spokeswoman for DCF. "If we tracked that information, we would have to do it in reverse. Why not track all the foster kids who graduated college and became successful?" • Commission on Capital Cases: Created by the Legislature in 1997, the commission oversees capital punishment cases and ensures that those convicted have proper access to legal representation. Roger Maas, the commission's executive director who has headed the commission since its formation, said he does not have such statistics. "Let me know if you figure out if it's true or not," Maas said. "I've never heard that, but it would be interesting to know." • Floridians for Alternatives to the Death Penalty: This Tampa-based group advocates for the elimination of the death penalty and is headed by Mark Elliott. Elliott said he has not come across any studies similar to what Wise claimed. "It doesn’t sound familiar," Elliott said, before referring us to a Miami-based criminal attorney. • Defense attorney: Terence Lenamon has made a name for himself representing high-profile death penalty cases, and founded the Florida Capital Resource Center, which collects statistics to provide to death penalty defense attorneys. He has been featured on CNN's Nancy Grace show and on the A&E reality crime-series The First 48. Lenamon currently represents Casey Anthony, the Orlando mother charged with murdering her 2-year-old daughter, Caylee Anthony. "I can assure you, not everyone on death row has been in the foster care system," Lenamon said in a phone interview. "I have two guys on there right now who weren't in the foster care system. That right there dispels the theory." Two killers who weren't in foster care The two clients Lenamon was referring to are Wadada Delhall and Harrel Braddy. Delhall was sentenced to death row in September 2008, after a jury found him guilty of the first-degree murder of Hubert McCrae. Delhall reportedly shot McCrae 11 times in front of an auto-repair shop where McCrae worked. McCrae was a witness to a previous murder at the same shop in which Delhall's brother was a suspect. During the sentencing hearing, Delhall's mother, Grace Allen, pleaded with the jury to spare her son's life, according to an Aug. 16, 2008, Miami Herald article. Allen told jurors how Delhall, her eldest son, assumed the responsibility of taking care of his five younger brothers when he was 18, because she was arrested on charges of drug trafficking in 1995. "He took care of his brothers, but he was never in foster care," Lenamon said. In Braddy's case, a Miami-Dade judge handed down the death penalty in 2007 for the 1998 killing of a 5-year-old girl. Braddy was accused of dumping Quatisha Maycock's body in the Florida Everglades, where she was attacked by alligators. "The child was found dead in the Everglades with alligator bite marks on her head and stomach and her left arm severed," reads an Oct. 16, 2007, Miami Herald article on the trial. "The medical examiner testified that the girl was still alive when one or more alligators bit her. Braddy told investigators he left Quatisha in the swamp because she witnessed him trying to kill her mother, who survived Braddy's choking attack." The article notes that both of Braddy's parents attended the trial, and Lenamon again stated his client was never in the foster care system. "I think it's kind of an irresponsible assertion to make without backing it up," Lenamon said of Wise's claim. Possible source The closest we came to information similar to Wise's claim was a March 24, 2009, posting that appeared in an online forum maintained by the Sun-Sentinel. The article was written by Mike Dunlavy, then chairman of Florida Youth Shine, a statewide advocacy group for foster care children. Dunlavy spent years in the Florida foster care system as a child, and was appointed by then-DCF secretary Bob Butterworth to a state Task Force for Child Protection. In the online forum called "The Slant," Dunlavy described a 2009 visit to Tallahassee to speak to the Senate PreK-12 Education Committee, of which Wise was also then a member. Dunlavy wrote: "Sen. Frederica Wilson, a Miami Democrat, asked, 'What happens to the foster youth who do not enter the Independent Living program.' That one was easy. 'Unfortunately,' I said, 'many of them fall to the wayside, contributing the root of the many ailments that plague our communities. Without support it's hard to imagine them creating a better way of life for themselves.' "She followed up with a statistical question that no one in the room knew off hand. Trying to maintain my wit, I answered 'I'll research that,' but you all might find it interesting that recent research shows that every person currently on Death Row in Florida spent time in foster care." We tracked down Dunlavy in Jacksonville, where he remains active in foster care advocacy, to ask him about that comment. He said he received the anecdote from a Tallahassee lobbyist dealing with children's rights issues. He could not recall the name of the person who gave him that statistic, or what group she might have represented. "I think it stretched so that it wasn't just kids in foster care, but kids who went through the adoption process, or kids who didn't quite make it into the foster care program but were abandoned," Dunlavy said. "Thinking back, I don't know how complete that figure was." Our ruling To us, this claim is woefully incomplete and unsubstantiated. The state agencies that supervise death row inmates and foster kids said they don't have information about inmates who were in foster care, nor do any other groups involved with death row or foster care that we could find. We easily found two cases of inmates on death row who had not been through the foster care system, disproving the claim of "all" death row inmates. A foster care advocate who made the same claim two years earlier says today he can't vouch for it. Perhaps Wise was just repeating Dunlavy's comment from 2009, or perhaps he is privy to other information that "every person on death row was a foster kid." We wish that the senator had called back to tell us the source for his comment, because it carries a harsh sting for those who are or have been in foster care, as well as the officials, families and volunteers who work with them. If we hear from him later, we will update this item. For now, we rate the claim False.	None	Stephen Wise	None	None	None	2011-04-25T09:42:09	2011-03-31	['None']

abbc-00114	A brawl reportedly involving up to 200 people in the Melbourne suburb of Collingwood has reignited the debate about crime in Victoria and, in particular, offending by African Australians.	in-the-green	http://www.abc.net.au/news/2018-09-05/fact-check-sudanese-gangs-victoria/10187550	Ms Nyuon's claim checks out. Between April 2017 and March 2018, they made up a combined 73.5 per cent of the unique offender population (those people alleged to have committed crimes) in Victoria; whereas, those born in Sudan made up 1.1 per cent. Experts told Fact Check that statistics from the CSA were an accurate representation of Victoria's offender characteristics. Monash University Associate Professor in Criminology Rebecca Wickes said: "1 per cent of offences are being committed by those who have reported being born in South Sudan. That is accurate." Melbourne University Professor of Criminology Mark Woods said: "Nyadol Nyuon's claim is correct; the overwhelming majority of crime in Victoria is committed by Australian-born offenders." This fact reflects population statistics more generally: Australian-born and New Zealand-born people account for 64.8 per cent and 1.6 per cent of Victoria's population, respectively. In percentage terms, there is a greater disparity between population and crime rates for people born in Sudan and South Sudan, who make up just 0.14 per cent of Victoria's population. However, experts stressed that discussions surrounding this issue fail to take into account the age profile of the Sudanese population in Victoria, which helps explain their overrepresentation in the crime statistics.

pomt-14806	"Ron Johnson said specifically that he hopes the first steps occur to privatize the" Veterans Administration.	half-true	/wisconsin/statements/2015/nov/27/russ-feingold/us-sen-ron-johnson-wants-take-first-steps-privatiz/	In an interview on a liberal talk show on Madison radio, Russ Feingold answered a question about the Veterans Administration -- hit by scandals nationally and in Wisconsin -- by contrasting himself and U.S. Sen. Ron Johnson, the man who took his Senate seat in 2010. Mike Crute, co-host of the "The Devil’s Advocates," asked Feingold on Nov. 12, 2015: "Do you think we have a problem with the Veterans Administration, does it need major reform, or does it simply need more financial resource?" Feingold, a Democrat who was in the Senate for 18 years, began his reply by saying: "Well, this is an area of enormous difference between me and the incumbent senator." Then he made an attack on Johnson, saying of his Republican opponent in the 2016 Senate race: "Look, we have to show a genuine commitment to make sure that veterans, when they come home, are able to get a job and that they have timely and adequate health care. The answer is not to privatize the VA. And Ron Johnson said specifically that he hopes the first steps occur to privatize the VA." As we’ll see, Johnson has advocated for privatizing elements of the VA -- such as allowing veterans to get medical care outside the VA system. But he has not gone so far to call for replacing a public system with an entirely private one. VA scandals The Veterans Administration’s medical care of veterans, both nationally and in Wisconsin, has been under fire for more than a year and a half. In May 2014, Veterans Affairs Secretary Eric Shinseki resigned from President Barack Obama's cabinet. There had been intense scrutiny of the VA during the previous month, following allegations that 40 patients died while awaiting care at a Phoenix VA hospital where employees kept a secret waiting list to cover up delays. It turned out to be a system-wide problem in which VA employees lied about how quickly they saw patients to take advantage of a program that incentivized VA hospitals if they scheduled a primary care appointment within 14 days. In January 2015, the California-based Center for Investigative Reporting revealed that doctors at the VA medical center in Tomah, Wis., handed out so many narcotic painkillers that some veterans took to calling the place "Candy Land." That led to scrutiny from the VA and state regulators, as well as the arrests of three people on charges of illegal drug sales at the facility. Also in January 2015, Milwaukee Journal Sentinel columnist Daniel Bice reported that Democratic U.S. Sen. Tammy Baldwin -- under fire for her office's inaction over alleged overmedication at Tomah -- abruptly ousted one of her top state staffers. And in March 2015, Bice reported that Johnson aides had sat on whistleblower tips about the facility. Johnson on the VA As for Johnson’s position on the VA, there’s no question he has pressed for turning to the private sector for some aspects of care. A couple of weeks after the VA secretary’s resignation, the Senate passed legislation aimed at easing scheduling problems at Veterans Affairs facilities by allowing the VA to contract with private medical facilities -- enabling veterans facing long waits to get quicker treatment. The bill also enabled the VA to use $500 million from its current budget to hire more medical staff. Johnson was one of only three senators to vote no, indicating he wanted to go further, in terms of private options. He said at the time that he preferred another bill, which he co-sponsored, that would have given veterans the ability to receive treatment outside the VA system -- not just from private facilities the VA might contract with. "I want to fix the problem and I think the best way to fix it is that we give veterans the ability to exit the system if they're not given quality care in a timely manner or if they're too far from a VA (facility)," Johnson said. The Feingold campaign cited that statement among others as evidence to back Feingold’s claim. These two statements were from March 2015 were the strongest: According to to VoteVets.org, which has produced material criticizing Johnson, Johnson said at a campaign event: "I’ll tell you from my standpoint, I believe the long-term solution on VA hospitals is, start moving it more toward a private system." In an interview with a Wausau, Wis., TV station, Johnson was asked if veterans should be treated in private health care. He said: "We're moving toward that model. The veterans' health care bill that we did pass, the Choice Act, starts a pilot program. And we need to assess that, we need to look at that very carefully. I don't want to throw everybody under the bus. I think the vast majority of people who work in the VA system are doing it because they really want to provide good, quality care. But, again, it's a bureaucratic, government-run system, and that's just a problem." Again, Johnson was advocating a move toward more privatization. But he left the door open to making changes that would stop short of turning to a completely private system. For example, in an October 2015 statement cited by Feingold’s campaign, Johnson said: "I really do think that is probably the long-term solution for the VA healthcare system is move more towards veterans’ choice. Accessing the private care system as opposed to building new centers that we’re not able to staff. There’s a better way of doing this. And I think it really is relying more on a private healthcare system." Our rating Feingold said "Johnson said specifically that he hopes the first steps occur to privatize the" Veterans Administration. Johnson has advocated for privatizing at least parts of the VA system, but not for moving to a completely private system. We rate Feingold’s claim Half True. More on Feingold-Johnson National Republican Senatorial Commitee: Says Russ Feingold cast the "deciding vote" for the "largest tax increase" in history. Mostly False. Feingold: Says Johnson "opposes entirely a federal minimum wage," except perhaps for "guest workers." True.

pomt-00392	"Thanks to President Trump and Republicans over the past year through July, U.S. manufacturing added 327,000 jobs, the most of any 12-month period since April 1995, when the figure added a healthy 345,000 positions."	mostly true	/west-virginia/statements/2018/sep/06/west-virginia-republican-party/its-largely-accurate-manufacturing-jobs-have-been-/	Have manufacturing jobs been on the rise more quickly than in two decades? The West Virginia Republican Party touted gains in manufacturing employment in a tweet on Aug. 7. "Thanks to President Trump and Republicans over the past year through July, U.S. manufacturing added 327,000 jobs, the most of any 12-month period since April 1995, when the figure added a healthy 345,000 positions," the tweet said. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com To support its assertion, the state party tweeted a link to a CNBC article that included that text verbatim. How accurate are those numbers? They check out. Between the months of July 2017-July 2018, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported a gain of 327,000 jobs in manufacturing, just as the CNBC article said. We looked at the previous July-to-July gains or losses in manufacturing jobs going back to 1994-95 and found that the 2018 performance was easily the best during that period. Here are the results: See Figure 2 on PolitiFact.com We also confirmed that from April 1994 to April 1995, the economy gained 345,000 manufacturing jobs. The intervening periods -- May 1994 to May 1995, and June 1994 to June 1994 -- both fell short of 345,000. We’ll note that manufacturing jobs are only slowly recovering the ground they have lost since the 1980s, and especially after the Great Recession in 2008 and 2009. Here’s the long view of manufacturing employment in the United States: To the extent that manufacturing employment has been increasing, it’s been doing so at a fairly steady -- if modest -- rate since 2010, including more than six years on President Barack Obama’s watch. In addition, while the tweet gave Trump and Republicans credit for the recent gain, economists say presidents don’t deserve either full credit or full blame for employment trends on their watch. The president is not all-powerful on economic matters; broader factors, from the business cycle to changes in technology to demographic shifts, play major roles. Our ruling The West Virginia Republican Party tweeted, "Thanks to President Trump and Republicans over the past year through July, U.S. manufacturing added 327,000 jobs, the most of any 12-month period since April 1995, when the figure added a healthy 345,000 positions." The numbers and the length of time are accurate. It’s worth noting, however, that the climb has been under way for years, and that many factors play a role in such economic achievements, not just the president or his party. The statement is accurate but needs additional information, so we rate it Mostly True.

pomt-13124	Says Russ Feingold "voted to raise taxes on Social Security benefits for seniors, he even tried to give Social Security benefits to illegal immigrants."	mostly false	/wisconsin/statements/2016/nov/03/ron-johnson/ron-johnson-russ-feingold-social-security-votes-ra/	A Ron Johnson radio ad that criticizes opponent Russ Feingold begins by talking about the federal budget deficit, then turns to one of the most common attack themes in election campaigns: Social Security. The female narrator in the ad, which was released Oct. 10, 2016, says Johnson’s Democratic challenger "voted to raise taxes on Social Security benefits for seniors, he even tried to give Social Security benefits to illegal immigrants." It’s a two-fer sort of claim, combining nearly identical attacks that Johnson has made separately elsewhere. For example, a TV ad by the Republican incumbent says Feingold "voted to increase taxes on Social Security benefits." https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/5e846588-f639-4bfd-b092-3704294314d4 And in the first debate of the Wisconsin Senate race, Johnson said Feingold "voted to tax Social Security benefits" and "also voted to give Social Security benefits to people who come into this country illegally." So, with the Nov. 8, 2016 election looming, let’s check the two parts of the claim from the radio ad. "Voted to raise taxes on Social Security benefits for seniors" Johnson’s campaign cites Feingold’s yes vote in 1993 on President Bill Clinton’s 1994 federal budget. One provision in the budget raised income taxes on Social Security benefits for middle-class and affluent seniors. A vote for the massive federal budget, of course, is a vote for the overall taxing-and-spending plan. It doesn’t necessarily mean support for every one of the thousands of provisions in it. For example, when Johnson was accused of having "supported a plan to cut benefits and raise the retirement age" for Social Security, our rating was Mostly False. Part of the evidence cited was Johnson’s vote for a federal budget plan, not a proposal dealing solely with Social Security. In this case, there was a motion to remove the tax increase from the budget. Feingold voted to table the motion -- a vote that helped keep the increase in the budget. Republicans have also posted a video clip of Feingold speaking prior to his votes that indicated why he was not opposed to the tax increase. He said he probably would vote for the tax increase because it would be paid only by people who were earning enough money that they were already paying income taxes on their Social Security benefits. So, the vote was to raise taxes only on more affluent Social Security recipients, not all of them. "Tried to give Social Security benefits to illegal immigrants" Johnson’s campaign cites a Feingold vote on an amendment to the Comprehensive Immigration Reform Act of 2006, saying Feingold voted against closing a loophole to ensure that illegal immigrants did not receive Social Security benefits. There was a motion to table the amendment and the motion was approved 50-49, with Feingold in the majority. In other words, the amendment failed. But we’ve already rated this part of the claim, when Johnson made it in the 2010 Feingold-Johnson campaign. Our rating was False. The amendment did not apply to illegal immigrants. It dealt with the policy on payments to formerly illegal workers -- undocumented workers who later were made legal. Illegal immigrants would not have been made eligible for Social Security benefits even if amendment had passed. Our rating Johnson says Feingold "voted to raise taxes on Social Security benefits for seniors, he even tried to give Social Security benefits to illegal immigrants." On a proposal that would have removed a tax increase on Social Security benefits from the 1994 federal budget, Feingold voted no and indicated he was satisfied the increase applied only to higher-income senior citizens. The tax increase wasn’t imposed on all Social Security recipients. Feingold did not vote to give Social Security benefits to illegal immigrants. For a statement that has an element of truth, our rating is Mostly False. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/e545737e-e5bf-4db1-a246-22fc389df84b	None	Ron Johnson	None	None	None	2016-11-03T09:30:00	2016-10-10	['Russ_Feingold', 'Social_Security_(United_States)']
pomt-05984	"Eleven states have enacted these pay-to-play reforms."	mostly true	/georgia/statements/2012/jan/23/william-perry/ga-group-uses-claim-back-pay-play-proposal/	The presidential race isn’t the only place where there has been some bare-knuckle debate recently. Atlanta Mayor Kasim Reed and Common Cause Georgia Executive Director William Perry went one on one during a recent broadcast on WXIA-TV, and it got quite heated. The main topic was Atlanta’s process of awarding contracts to individuals and companies hoping to run businesses at the city-owned Hartsfield-Jackson International Airport. Perry’s argument: It wasn’t transparent and lends itself to accusations of cronyism. Reed’s take: It was open, and Perry’s complaints were hypocritical. Perry wants Atlanta to enact pay-to-play legislation that would restrict campaign contributions to elected officials or candidates running for office. Perry’s proposal would cap campaign contributions for those doing business with Atlanta at $250 per business entity. He wrote a letter to Reed outlining the idea and said he supports similar legislation for the state of Georgia and in Fulton County. "It is the state law in 11 states and has withstood court challenges, so we’ll continue to push it because it is good public policy," Perry said during the WXIA broadcast on Jan. 4. Perry’s claim about 11 states having pay-to-play laws prompted us to test the accuracy of his claim on the Truth-O-Meter. During the Jan. 3 Atlanta City Council meeting, Perry and Councilman H. Lamar Willis went back and forth on several details concerning Perry’s pay-to-play idea. Perry defended the idea. "It is the state law in 11 states and has withstood court challenges, so we’ll continue to push it because it is good public policy," Perry said. Perry said the 11 states he was referring to were California, Connecticut, Hawaii, Illinois, Louisiana, New Jersey, Ohio, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, Vermont and West Virginia. Perry told PolitiFact Georgia he may have underestimated the total. He provided us a May 2010 report by the law firm Perkins Cole to back up his argument. The report on pay-to-play statutes lists 19 states with some sort of pay-to-play guidelines. Some of those states, such as New Jersey, prohibit businesses with state contracts exceeding $17,500 from making contributions to any candidate, state or county political committee. New Jersey’s law has an exemption for highway contracts. Other states in the report that Perry cited have guidelines that are more narrowly defined. Here are some examples from the report Perry sent us: Indiana prohibits anyone who has a contract with that state’s Lottery Commission from making a contribution to a political candidate while the contract is in effect and three years after the contract has expired. Violators can face up to three years in prison and a $10,000 fine. Louisiana has pay-to-play restrictions on casino operators, no-bid hurricane rebuilding contractors and contractors for the Louisiana Citizens Property Insurance Corp. New Mexico does not allow a prospective contractor, family member or representative to give a campaign contribution or any other thing of value to a public official during the negotiation period for a sole-source or small purchase contract. In Pennsylvania, a person who has made a political contribution to a municipal official or candidate within the past two years is disqualified from entering into a contract with that municipality’s pension system. The report notes two states that had their pay-to-play initiatives removed. In Florida, state lawmakers repealed two statutes concerning pay-to-play. In Colorado, the state Supreme Court overturned its law that sole-source government contractors and their families cannot contribute to political campaigns during the contract or two years afterward. The court ruled it violated the First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. Natalie O. Wood, an official with the National Conference of State Legislatures, published a study of pay-to-play laws for her organization in 2009. Her report concluded that there were nine states with comprehensive pay-to-play laws: Colorado, Connecticut, Hawaii, Illinois, Kentucky, New Jersey, Ohio, South Carolina and West Virginia. Each state has laws that essentially limit people doing business with the government from making campaign contributions to elected officials or candidates. In an interview, Wood said she would cut that list to eight states because of the Colorado court decision. She discussed the distinction between comprehensive pay-to-play laws and the rules in some states that focus on sole-source contracts. "My understanding of the issue of no-bid versus competitive-bid contracts is that in those states that only focus on the former, the ban on contributions would only impact companies who obtained their contract without having to bid on it," Wood said. A few states have seen legal efforts to challenge pay-to-play laws, arguing the guidelines violate free speech. Some have argued the laws aren’t strong enough. New Jersey Comptroller Matthew Boxer complained in September that the state’s pay-to-play law "does not work" because some local governments exploit a loophole that allows them to award contracts to any vendor — regardless of how much money they contribute to candidates — as long as they use a "fair and open" process. Perry told us he stood by his claim. "Some [states’ pay-to-play laws] are extremely specific while others are expansive," he said. "In at least 11 states, there is some recognition that it is not a good idea to allow campaign contributions to decision makers." There are variations of pay-to-play laws in at least 11 states, as Perry said. However, some are more detailed and comprehensive than others, as Wood said. The laws in some states seem to be less rigorous than what Perry has proposed in the city of Atlanta. We believe Perry’s claim needs some clarification and rate it as Mostly True.

pomt-03963	Wisconsin’s laws "ranked the worst in the world for mining investment."	mostly false	/wisconsin/statements/2013/feb/15/wisconsin-manufacturers-and-commerce/wisconsin-regulations-ranked-worst-world-mining-bu/	With the prospect of thousands of jobs being created in northern Wisconsin, Republican legislators and business leaders are once again leading a push for changes to the state’s mining laws. Gogebic Taconite has continued to express interest in spending $1.5 billion to open an iron ore mine in far northwestern Wisconsin. Before it proceeds, the company wants lawmakers to write new laws specifically for iron mining that would relax some environmental rules and provide greater certainty about the regulatory process. A bill to accommodate Gogebic narrowly died in 2012 and with Republicans back in control of both houses and the governor’s office, a renewed campaign to secure passage is under way. Wisconsin Manufacturers and Commerce, the state’s largest business group, has aggressively pushed for the bill’s approval. In interviews and public hearing testimony, the group’s chief lobbyist, Scott Manley, has spent months trying to put Wisconsin’s mining laws into perspective. At a Jan. 23, 2013, public hearing before a joint legislative committee considering mining legislation, Manley had this to say about the need for mining legislation: "A recent survey of 500 mining companies throughout the world by the Fraser Institute … found alarming evidence that Wisconsin’s environmental regulations and regulatory framework discourage investment in mining jobs. "For example, of the 79 states and countries analyzed in the survey, Wisconsin’s environmental regulations ranked the worst in the world for mining investment. Eighty-five percent of the respondents characterized Wisconsin’s environmental laws as either a ‘strong deterrent to investment’ or ‘would not invest due to this factor.’ The Fraser Institute survey diagnoses a significant problem with Wisconsin’s mining laws." Manley has made similar statements in the past, including a Nov. 30, 2012, interview with talk show host Charlie Sykes, and in a Nov. 24, 2012, Milwaukee Journal Sentinel opinion piece. So, is Wisconsin really worst in the world for mining investment? Let’s start with the study. Since 1997, the Fraser Institute, an independent Canadian think tank, has taken a look at the state of the mining industry around the world. The group says it conducts "an annual survey of metal mining and exploration companies to assess how mineral endowments and public policy factors such as taxation and regulation affect exploration investment. Survey results represent the opinions of executives and exploration managers in mining and mining consulting companies operating around the world." The survey Manley cites is Fraser’s 2010-11 report. The results were gathered between Oct. 19 and Dec. 3, 2010. That time frame overlapped the election for governor won by Republican Scott Walker, but was well before discussion on mining legislation heated up. There have also been two reports issued since then -- and those reports don’t include Wisconsin. So, Manley is picking an outdated report to make his point. What’s more, it is a survey. The results are determined by whoever chooses to respond. It is not scientific. So, the conclusions you can draw from it are limited. In the survey in question, Fraser sent it to 3,000 mining and exploration firms and executives, and received responses from 494, or about 16.5 percent. All told, the responses addressed the economic and political climates for mining in 79 regions around the world. That underlines how the results are dictated by who responded, not by any effort to represent all states or countries in a proportional way. Nor does it require any particular knowledge of how one state’s regulations compare to, say, another country’s regulations. The findings, when listed as the top 10 and bottom 10 geographic regions, were pretty grim for Wisconsin. "The bottom 10 scorers are Indonesia, Zimbabwe, Wisconsin, Madagascar, India, Guatemala, Bolivia, DRC (Congo), Venezuela, and Honduras," the report said. "Unfortunately, except for Wisconsin these are all developing nations which most need the new jobs and increased prosperity mining that can produce." The report included two comments about Wisconsin. In each case, the respondent is described only in vague terms. "Make everyone do without any mining products for a month or a year in Wisconsin. Outlaw all mining materials. — Producer company with more than US $50M revenue, Senior management" "Wisconsin properly evaluates the economic impact of mineral development to job growth and economic stability. — Consulting company, Consultant" So how did Wisconsin wind up so low on the list? Fraser conducts its surveys anonymously, and keeps most of the raw data secret. However, there are indications that few of the responses pertained to Wisconsin. And the responses received about Wisconsin were strongly negative about the economic and policy climate for mining in the state. Some examples: -- One key question -- asking for a rating for regions that had the "most/least favorable policies toward mining" -- received only 13 responses about Wisconsin. That is based on a raw number (one of the few provided) that was included in a spreadsheet accompanying the report. Wisconsin received no "most favorable" votes, and 13 "least favorable." That compares with 116 responses for Quebec, deemed the most favorable region, and 68 for Venezuela, the least favorable. -- Fraser dropped Wisconsin from its two subsequent surveys, for 2011-12, as well as the soon-to-be-released 2012-13 study, according to the group’s survey coordinator, Alana Wilson. Regions are dropped when there are fewer than 10 respondents for that area. -- Asked about "uncertainty concerning the administration, interpretation and enforcement of existing regulations," 88 percent said Wisconsin’s situation was negative for investment in mining, while 12 percent said state rules were either a mild deterrent or no deterrent to such investment. In short, the responses about Wisconsin were heavily negative and appear to have come from as few as 13, or 2.6 percent, of the 494 responses received by Fraser in 2010. (A spokesman said executives from Gogebic did not participate in the survey.) Manley said in an interview he was unaware of the details about the Fraser survey, other than that it was sent to about 3,000 mining industry officials. He said he didn’t know about the small sample size or that Wisconsin was dropped from subsequent surveys. "The people that they are asking are the people who are interested in making that investment or not" in mining, Manley said. "I can’t think of another survey that has the breadth of taking the pulse of the mining industry." Manley said the survey results were consistent with the situation in Wisconsin, at least in terms of mining regulations, and history. He said that the current state law, in effect since 1998, amounts to a "mining moratorium" because it sets unreasonably high standards for establishment of a new mine. Also, he said, only one mine has received a permit under the existing state law. Dating to 1974, the Flambeau mine near Ladysmith that operated for a short time and is now closed. (Lead miners were active in the 1800s, including some before the state was established. Besides Flambeau, other mines operated but not under modern regulations.) Manley said the Fraser report puts Wisconsin in the same group as developing countries and "from our standpoint it underscores the need for reform." Our rating WMC says Wisconsin is among the "worst in the world" for mining investment, according to a study by a Canadian think tank. To be sure, the state landed in the bottom 10, along with numerous developing countries and no other U.S. states. But the methodology behind the report illustrates the flaws in using it to make sweeping comparisons. A small number of people familiar with Wisconsin answered -- so small that the state was dropped from subsequent surveys. We rate the claim Mostly False.

pomt-02631	In Virginia, "Medicaid has grown by 1,600 percent in the last 30 years."	true	/virginia/statements/2014/jan/20/william-howell/speaker-howell-says-virginias-medicaid-costs-are-1/	House Speaker William Howell says Virginia should rein in the ever-rising costs of Medicaid rather than expand the program to cover 400,000 additional low-income Virginians. Howell, R-Stafford, staunchly opposes Gov. Terry McAuliffe’s goal to broaden the state’s Medicaid program as part of Obamacare. The speaker, in a January 5 op-ed in the Free Lance-Star in Fredericksburg, wrote that Medicaid is rife with waste and fraud and in dire need of reform. "Medicaid has grown by 1,600 percent in the last 30 years," Howell wrote. Howell was referring to the cost of Virginia’s Medicaid program -- an expense evenly split between the federal government and the state. We’ve heard the figure he cited before. Former Gov. Bob McDonnell used it repeatedly in explaining his reluctance to expand the program. Under Obamacare, the federal government would pay all the costs of the new enrollees’ health care until 2016, and eventually, 90 percent from 2020 and beyond. We wondered whether the 1,600 percent growth figure is correct. Matthew Moran, a Howell spokesman, pointed us to data from the House Appropriations Committee showing the total of state and federal funds budgeted for Virginia’s Medicaid program was $455 million in 1984 and projected at $8.1 billion this fiscal year. That’s a 1,683 percent increase. We also sought Medicaid spending figures from the Virginia Department of Medical Assistance Services -- the agency that administers Medicaid, which now covers about 1 million Virginians. We got somewhat different numbers. Craig Markva, a DMAS spokesman, said his agency estimates Medicaid costs increased by about 1,400 percent over the thirty-year period. Why are the numbers different? Markva noted that DMAS was formed in 1985 -- one year after the starting date for Howell’s claim. Prior to that, he said some Medicaid expenses were pooled with costs of other health programs in the state budget. DMAS estimates the 1984 Medicaid price tag was $531 million -- some $76 million above the committee figure the Howell used. Either way, it’s a huge increase. Markva said policy makers started using the 1,600 percent figure a few years ago and, back then, it was undisputedly accurate. Between 1980 and 2010, he said, DMAS estimates Medicaid rose by 1,650 percent. What caused this tsunami? Inflation played a big part. The 30-year figures cited by Howell and the House Appropriations Committee fall to a 694 percent increase in Medicaid costs when adjusted for inflation. DMAS, in a report last June, said rising healthcare costs and greater use of services accounted for most of the increased costs in the state’s medicaid program between 1990 and 2012. Growing enrollments also pushed up costs, according to DMAS. There were 300,000 enrolled in the program in 1990 and that grew to 1 million in 2012. Enrollments have risen for a couple of reasons, Markva explained. "Some of this was simply population growth," Markva said in an e-mail. Also contributing to the surge were federal laws that significantly expanded the population eligible for Medicaid, Markva said. The state contributed to the growth by transferring people with intellectual disabilities out of institutions and into the community homes where they require costly long-term care. Markva said the annual cost per Medicaid enrollee was $1,617 in 1980, and that rose to $6,453 in 2010. "This is a 453 percent increase or about 6 percent per year," Markva said. "Much of this increase is simply the same increase in health care cost that everyone experience over this time period. Some increase was also due to the creation and expansion of waiver programs, which bring into the program new members and new services, resulting in higher per person costs." The rest of the nation has also seen large hikes in their Medicaid spending. Total Medicaid spending among all states rose from $33.1 billion in 1985 to $398.4 billion in 2012, according to a report from the National Association of State Budget Officers. That’s an 1,100 percent increase. Adjusted for inflation, it comes to a 332 percent rise. Our ruling Howell said the cost of Medicaid in Virginia "has grown by 1,600 percent over the last 30 years." We find no reason to quibble. The Speaker accurately cited budget figures kept by the House Appropriations Committee, a source that many around the Capitol -- including PolitiFact Virginia -- turn to for reliable data.

pomt-07627	"Florida is one of only three states that require licenses for commercial interior designers."	true	/florida/statements/2011/mar/18/national-federation-independent-business-florida/business-group-says-florida-one-three-states-regul/	Abhorred by Florida Gov. Rick Scott, Republican legislators and even President Barack Obama, regulations have been a popular target of lawmakers this year. Prosperity in the private sector, they say, will come when government removes rules that stifle competition and growth. On Jan. 25, 2011, the House Business and Consumer Affairs Subcommittee heard regulation-related complaints from several pro-business representatives, including Allen Douglas, legislative affairs director for the National Federation of Independent Business’ Florida branch. The NFIB is a national association of advocates for small businesses. Douglas focused his complaints on state licenses, particularly those for interior designers. The state issues licenses for many professions, but the interior design license is a hot debate. Proponents say it takes a certified design professional to ensure a commercial space is fit for human needs. Opponents, like the NFIB, argue it should not take several years of experience, education and exams to do the job, and Florida’s law is too severe. "Florida is one of only three states that require licenses for commercial interior designers," Douglas told the committee. "The argument will be it’s a public safety and health issue. … If you’re in an office building with a lot of cubicles, the aisle ways need to be a certain width, you know, you can’t block the fire exits. Well, there’s other people in place -- fire marshals, other types of inspectors -- that will take care of that. "It keeps people out of the industry, because it’s very hard to become a commercial interior designer in this state." Back up: Florida is one of just three states that requires a license for commercial interior designers? That’s an exclusive club, if true. We had to give this claim a second look. We started by checking the Florida Statutes, to see whether Florida regulates its commercial interior designers in the first place. The answer is yes. Florida has a "practice act" that mandates commercial interior designers have licenses. To attain one in Florida, an aspiring designer must achieve six years of education and experience and pass all three portions of the National Council for Interior Design Qualification exam. There is a $125 biennial renewal fee, and continuing education is also required. A practice act is more stringent than title or registration acts in other states, which regulate the profession in name only. Many states have title or registration acts that allow applicants to market themselves as "certified" or "registered" interior designers as long as they meet varied exam, education and experience requirements and fees. Earning state approval is a way to give consumers a certain amount of confidence in whom they hire. Next we touched base with Douglas. He says he got involved with Florida’s interior design law in 2009, when the NFIB and the Institute for Justice, a national libertarian law firm, filed a federal lawsuit against the state Board of Architecture and Interior Design challenging Florida’s practice act. The Institute for Justice put up a YouTube video and statement about Florida’s interior design law two years ago, calling the state "ground zero in the nationwide battle to ‘cartel-ize’ the interior design industry." The institute claimed interior design regulations have several consequences, including higher fees and fewer employment opportunities, "especially for minorities and older mid-career switchers." On Feb. 4, 2010, U.S. District Court Judge Robert Hinkle of the Northern District of Florida ruled in the NFIB’s favor on one part of the lawsuit: A rule that limited the use of "interior designer" to only those with licenses was unconstitutional. This decision allows unlicensed residential decorators the option to market themselves as "interior designers." However, Hinkle upheld Florida’s practice act, which governs non-residential designers, as constitutional. The NFIB and Institute for Justice appealed their lawsuit to the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals in Alabama. On March 1, 2011, the appeals court rejected their case in a 24-page document, saying in part it would not "second-guess the legislature’s judgment as to the relative safety justifications versus any burdens imposed on interstate commerce." The appeals court affirmed the district court’s ruling, so Florida’s interior design law remains in effect. So, to recap: Interior designers in Florida need a license for jobs that involve commercial spaces, draperies, flooring, clubhouses and swimming pool areas. The license enables them to submit stamped and signed drawing plans and carry out work on design projects. But no one needs a license to offer residential interior design, or services including window treatments and paint. The Department of Business and Professional Regulation, which oversees the board, sums it up for consumers: "If you are going to hire someone to design the interior of a commercial structure, he/she needs to be licensed." But what we wanted to check is whether three states is correct. Douglas pointed us to Patti Morrow, executive director of the Interior Designer Protection Council and a staunch advocate for fewer restrictions on the industry. Morrow tracks interior design legislation for all states on her website. She is sometimes depicted boasting pink boxing gloves, symbolizing her fight against Florida’s "anti-competitive, anti-consumer monopoly" of interior design. She said by phone that four states used to require a license to practice interior design: Florida, Alabama, Louisiana and Nevada. But Alabama left the pack when the state Supreme Court ruled its practice act unconstitutional in 2007. So that leaves three. Morrow, who lives in New Hampshire, appeared at an emotional committee meeting of the Florida House, which passed a bill that would roll back regulation of interior designers and 30 other professions, on March 15, 2011. She repeated at that meeting the claim about Florida being one of three states to regulate commercial interior design. We then went to the website of the pro-licensing side, the Interior Design Associations Foundation, which also tracks state legislation, to corroborate the count. The American Society of Interior Designers offers a similar state-by-state view of requirements for interior designers. Check! These groups’ practice-act counts match up to Morrow’s count of three states. Now, we should mention that while those three states are the only that require "licenses," several states — including New York, Kentucky and Alabama -- have education, experience and exam requirements that do not result in a license but grant use of a title. In New York, for instance, a "certified interior designer" applicant must pay a $377 fee, be at least 21, have at least seven years of acceptable education and experience credits, pass the NCIDQ, and "be of good moral character." Douglas said that "Florida is one of only three states that requires licenses for commercial interior designers. Both the pro- and anti-licensing camps agree that only Florida, Nevada and Louisiana require licenses to practice commercial interior design, and a court upheld the Florida law earlier this month. The state Legislature is trying to remove some of the restrictions on these licenses, but it has not happened yet. So we rate this statement True.

pomt-05955	"Nearly half of all persons under 30 did not go to work today."	pants on fire!	/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/jan/25/mitch-daniels/mitch-daniels-says-nearly-half-all-persons-under-3/	During the Republican response to the State of the Union address, Indiana Gov. Mitch Daniels painted a grim picture of American employment today. "The president did not cause the economic and fiscal crises that continue in America tonight, but he was elected on a promise to fix them, and he cannot claim that the last three years have made things anything but worse," Daniels said in the nationally televised address. "The percentage of Americans with a job is at the lowest in decades. One in five men of prime working age and nearly half of all persons under 30 did not go to work today." There are a lot of facts in that sentence, but many readers zeroed in on the claim that "nearly half of all persons under 30 did not go to work today." So we’ll take a look at it. We turned to numbers from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the federal agency responsible for tabulating employment statistics. The bureau’s website allows users to mix and match the national data by various sub-categories, including age. There’s no single category for "under 30," and BLS doesn’t calculate data on those below the age of 16, but we were able to put together an "under 30" category by merging four others: 16 to 17; 18 to 19; 20 to 24; and 25 to 29. This also allowed us to compare statistics for those separate groups. The purest comparison we did -- one that seems to track Daniels’ statement most closely -- is to divide the number of people employed by the total number of persons in that age group. This statistic is known as the "employment to population ratio." We then flipped this ratio around to mirror how Daniels phrased it -- the total of persons not working divided by total population in that age group. For December 2011, the most recent month available, we found that 44.4 percent of the 16-to-29 age group was not employed. So, Daniels is in the ballpark. But there’s a problem: This is a ridiculous statistic to use. It includes Americans aged 16 to 18 (who are supposed to be in high school) and those 18 to 22 (many of whom are in college). If you leave high schoolers out of the equation and look only at ages 18 to 29, then the percentage who are not working declines to 37.5 percent. If you look only at ages 25 to 29, an age when most people are out of school altogether, it declines further, to 27.1 percent. But even this is beside the point if you are trying to craft a credible statistic. A more appropriate measure for Daniels would have been the tried-and-true unemployment rate. The unemployment rate takes the number of unemployed people and divides it by those who are "in the labor force," which means that they are either employed or are jobless but looking for work. This measurement ignores people who are not seeking work, such as students or individuals who are raising children full-time or are unable to work for whatever reason. These statistics offer a significantly different picture. In the broadest age range -- 16 to 29 -- the unemployment rate is 13.6 percent. For those between 18 and 29, it’s 12.9 percent. For those between 20 and 29, it’s 11.9 percent. And for those between 25 and 29, it’s 9.7 percent. None of these measures gets Daniels any higher than 13.6 percent of the population -- far lower than the nearly 50 percent figure he cited. Our ruling We suppose in a narrow sense, Daniels has a point that "nearly half of all persons under 30 did not go to work today." But that’s because the number includes many people who have no desire to work -- for instance, full-time high school or college students, stay-at-home parents or others who are unable to work. We can understand the concern about the nation’s current high level of unemployment, particularly among youth. Americans age 16 to 19 have an unemployment rate of 23.1 percent, and those who are 20 to 24 have a rate of 14.4 percent -- both well above the 8.5 percent for all age groups, which is itself elevated from historical averages. Still, the statistic Daniels chose to document this one is a wildly misleading one. We rate it Pants on Fire. UPDATE: After we published our story, a spokeswoman for Gov. Daniels replied to our query. She said that "the employment-to-population ratio, which captures the number of people working as a percent of the population, is an important indicator of economic activity and the health of the society. For the 16-to-29-year-old cohort, the ratio peaked at 68.2 percent in 1989 and declined by 7.5 percentage points over the next 19 years, reaching 60.7 percent in 2008. The EPOP was 55.2 percent for 2011. So the nearly half -- 44.8% -- is correct. I would not agree that only those captured as unemployed in the unemployment rate are of concern. The total number of people actually working is important. Of course the governor wants students to pursue post-secondary education and has pursued ways to make it easier for them to do so during his tenure as governor." We stand by our original ruling.

pomt-06518	"The reality is that we have roughly 15,000 undocumented immigrants living in the state..."	false	/rhode-island/statements/2011/oct/11/jorge-elorza/law-professor-says-ri-has-roughly-15000-undocument/	The decision by the Rhode Island Board of Governors for Higher Education to allow undocumented immigrants to be eligible for in-state tuition at the state’s public colleges and university made for lively debate on a recent Channel 10 "News Conference." Jorge O. Elorza, a professor of law at the private Roger Williams University School of Law, who supports the policy, faced off with one of the policy’s most vocal opponents, William T. "Terry" Gorman, executive director of Rhode Islanders for Immigration Law Enforcement. During the discussion, Elozra argued in favor of the policy, saying it will give undocumented students a better chance of going to college and building careers. "The reality is that we have roughly 15,000 undocumented immigrants living in the state, and they’re here and they’re not going anywhere," he said. "And so I think as a state we have to ask ourselves, do we make engineers, scientists and innovators out of them? Or do we deny them a college education . . . ?’’ Wait, did he really say 15,000? (Yes, he did.) But other estimates we’ve seen say there are twice as many. At a time of heated debate in Rhode Island and nationally over laws and policies with respect to undocumented immigrants, it’s clearly important to get as accurate a number for this population as possible. To be fair, there are no hard numbers; only estimates. PolitiFact Rhode Island addressed the issue in a fact-check in January of Gorman’s claim that illegal immigration costs Rhode Island $400 million a year. (We ruled Gorman’s claim Pants on Fire.) In researching that item, we used data from the federal Department of Homeland Security and the Pew Hispanic Center to come up with an estimate of 30,000 to 35,000 illegal immigrants in Rhode Island -- twice as many as Elorza said. So we asked Elorza how he came up with the 15,000 estimate. "I did a Google search,’’ the professor said. And he sent us a link to his source material: a Web site called StateMaster.com. Sure enough, the site has a chart entitled: "Estimated number of illegal immigrants (most recent) by state." The StateMaster chart reports the estimated number of "illegal" immigrants in Rhode Island as 16,000. The facts The U.S. Department of Homeland Security’s Office of Immigration Statistics reported that the "unauthorized" immigrant population in this country in 2010 was 10.8 million. The agency doesn’t report data for Rhode Island; it only offers estimates for states with larger populations because of the "uncertainty in the precision for smaller states,’’ DHS spokesman Michael Hoefer told PolitiFact earlier this year. But a February 2011 report by the Pew Hispanic Center offers estimates for smaller states, including Rhode Island. Their estimate for "unauthorized" immigrants in Rhode Island in 2010 was 30,000 -- twice as many as Elzora stated during the TV news conference. How did Pew arrive at 30,000? We posed that question to Jeffrey S. Passel, Pew’s senior demographer. (He was in Colorado at a conference of experts who are developing projections about future levels of immigration worldwide.) For large states and the country as a whole, Passel said, Pew researchers analyze Homeland Security data about legal immigrants entering those states. They compare that data with the number of immigrants counted in those states during the Current Population Survey conducted by the U.S. Census. The survey doesn’t count everyone, he said, so Pew adjusts for people left out of the survey. From the Current Population Survey, the data crunchers can see who reported that they were not born in the United States and then use other information they reported in the survey -- such as whether they work for the government or receive food stamps or welfare -- to determine if they are living in this country legally. (To get a government job or food stamps, a person is generally required to have a Social Security number, so "it’s a very strong indicator,’’ Passel said, "that the people are legal.") The researchers then create two categories: people who are "definitely here legally," he said, and those who are "possibly here illegally." The difference between the number of immigrants who are living in the country legally and the total number of immigrants reported in the Current Population Survey produces the estimated number surveyed who are "unauthorized immigrants.’’ The Pew estimate for Rhode Island has a margin of error of plus or minus 5,000, so the actual number of unauthorized immigrants in the state could be 25,000 to 35,000, according to the report. Nationally, Pew reported, the number of unauthorized immigrants in the country in 2010 was about 11.2 million. So, where did the 15,000 number that Elorza used for Rhode Island come from? Old data StateMaster.com, the web site that Elorza cited, claims that its data are the "most recent." But scroll down to the bottom of its chart and read the fine print. Just below where it shows the total U.S. illegal immigrant population estimate as 6.9 million -- next to the red capital letters that say "DEFINITION" -- is this disclosure: "Latest available data - 2000 Census...’’ The chart is based on 11-year-old data. Since then, the estimated population of undocumented immigrants in Rhode Island has almost doubled. Peter Skerry, a political science professor at Boston College who has studied immigration trends for two decades, offers this caution about using data from the Internet. "If I go to a dinner party and want to say something, I’ll go to Google or Wikipedia,’’ Skerry said. "But if I’m going to do an interview on immigration . . . I’m going to rely on the best sources I can find. Everything on a computer screen isn’t necessarily right." To recap, the statement by Professor Elorza that Rhode Island has about 15,000 undocumented immigrants in Rhode Island is based on 11-year-old data and current estimates put the number at about twice that many. To his credit, when the error was brought to Elorza’s attention he acknowledged it and directed us to the current data from the Pew Center report. "Terry Gorman told me off air that he thought the number of undocumented immigrants was larger,’’ Elorza said in an e-mail. "I told him I had no problem using the larger number; it made my point even stronger.’’ If only he had checked his numbers before he went on TV. But he didn’t, so we rate Elorza’s claim False.

pomt-13065	"Thirty-one percent of school districts are still receiving less funding per pupil than they did prior to the dramatic budget cuts of 2011."	mostly true	/texas/statements/2016/nov/16/donna-howard/donna-howard-says-31-percent-texas-school-district/	A Democratic legislator maintains lawmakers in 2017 can step up spending on education and other necessities partly by tapping the state’s so-called rainy day fund. As things stand, Donna Howard of Austin wrote in a September 2016 commentary in the Austin American-Statesman: "Thirty-one percent of school districts are still receiving less funding per pupil than they did prior to the dramatic budget cuts of 2011." We wondered if that was so. 2011, to refresh, was when the Republican-led Legislature addressed a projected revenue shortfall in part by revising school funding formulas. Those changes and other cuts resulted in school districts getting $5 billion less in state aid through August 2013 compared to what districts likely would have fielded otherwise. Aide: Howard drew on state prediction Asked how Howard reached her 31 percent conclusion, Jacob Cottingham in her office told us she relied on a Legislative Budget Board staff projection. Cottingham forwarded a Sept. 21, 2016, email from Andy MacLaurin, a board manager, containing a splash of the state’s legendarily acronymic funding formulas. M&O refers to school maintenance and operations funding and WADA refers to the "weighted average daily attendance" student counts used by the state to calculate how much a district stands to get in state and local aid, taking into account varied student needs. MacLaurin wrote that according to the 2015 projection, 31.3 percent of the state’s 1,000-plus school districts "were projected to have a lower M&O revenue per WADA" in fiscal 2016 "than they did in fiscal year 2011 while in fiscal year 2017," MacLaurin said, "23.8 percent of districts were projected to have a lower M&O revenue per WADA than in fiscal year 2011." So, there’s Howard’s stated 31 percent. Then again, the projection indicated, fewer districts (nearly 24 percent) were expected to get less aid per student in fiscal 2017 (the current fiscal year) compared with 2011. Also, MacLaurin’s email signaled more analysis to come, stating: "However, please note that these figures are based on the model the LBB has used since the end of last session; this fall, we'll be updating the model with new student counts and property value estimates which are likely to change these percentages." Next, we followed up with LBB staff spokesman R.J. DeSilva who emailed us district-by-district aid projections behind the information sent to Howard. DeSilva also noted that the cited projection, developed in May 2015, indicated that on average, school districts were projected to field more aid per student in fiscal 2016 ($6,149) and 2017 ($6,098) than the districts got in fiscal 2011 ($5,734). Actual spending data Enough of projections; we hunted up-to-date spending data. We initially queried the Texas Association of School Boards, which advocates at the Capitol, where Dax Gonzalez referred us to the Texas Association of School Business Officials, which trains school finance and operations professionals. Later, at our request, Tom Canby of TASBO developed and emailed us a spreadsheet, drawing on audited revenues reported to the Texas Education Agency. The spreadsheet, which adjusted for inflation, indicates that compared with fiscal 2011, 395 of the state’s 1,024 districts, or 38 percent, fielded less state and local funding per student in fiscal 2015, the latest year of available data. Canby said he focused on M&O aid, leaving out aid related to debt service or capital projects. Also, when applicable, he said, he did not take into account "Robin Hood" payments from property-wealthy districts to others as required by law. We spotted another way to break down the figures. Again adjusted for inflation, the districts fielding less per-student state and local aid in 2015 served 1.1 million students, or 22 percent of nearly 5 million students statewide. Flip side: More than 3.8 million students, 78 percent, attended schools in districts that got more such aid per student. According to the spreadsheet, the Austin, North East, Frisco, Round Rock and Clear Creek districts were the largest districts that drew less state plus local aid per student in 2015 compared with 2011. Highest-enrollment districts fielding more of such per-student aid in 2015 were the Houston, Dallas, Cypress-Fairbanks, Northside and Fort Worth districts. Canby, asked why certain districts were getting less aid per student than four years before, replied that how school funding works in Texas is so convoluted, "there is no simple plain English explanation." Why do some districts get less than before? We reached a sanded-down explanation after hearing more from Canby and eliciting the detailed emailed analysis of Amanda Brownson, research director for Raise Your Hand Texas, an advocacy group that says it focuses on giving every student access to high-quality public education. Basically, some districts have remained short of making up for plummets in local revenue touched off by state lawmakers a decade past. In that 2006 special session, members voted to drive down local school property tax rates as championed by then-Gov. Rick Perry. Lawmakers also agreed to shore up districts by filling the self-created revenue gaps with state aid but that move was accompanied by a stipulation that a district would no longer draw the shore-up or "hold harmless" aid once oft-tweaked state education funding formulas delivered enough money to make up the difference. One more pivot: in 2011, revenue-strapped lawmakers shaved the shore-up or "hold-harmless" money--a move that remains in effect--delaying full recovery for some districts. Our ruling Howard said 31 percent of Texas districts are receiving less funding per pupil than they did prior to the 2011 "budget cuts." Howard’s assessment was based on a 16-month-old projection while actual results appear to have been worse. Inflation-adjusted data suggest 38 percent of districts fielded less state and local aid per student in fiscal 2015 than before the 2011 reductions. We rate Howard’s statement Mostly True.

pomt-11552	"The Democrats are pushing for Universal HealthCare while thousands of people are marching in the UK because their U system is going broke and not working."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2018/feb/08/donald-trump/donald-trump-wrongly-suggests-british-dont-love-th/	As thousands marched in the streets of London recently to protest funding cuts to the British National Health Service, President Donald Trump took to Twitter to criticize the idea of universal health care. "The Democrats are pushing for Universal HealthCare while thousands of people are marching in the UK because their U system is going broke and not working. Dems want to greatly raise taxes for really bad and non-personal medical care. No thanks!" See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com Trump’s Feb. 5 tweet came shortly after Nigel Farage, the former UK Independence Party leader, talked about the NHS march and universal health care on Fox & Friends, warning Americans it would be "politically impossible" to remove such a system once introduced. Trump thanked the network on Twitter for "exposing the truth" shortly after Farage’s appearance. We wondered how accurate Trump’s claim was that people joined the NHS march because the UK’s universal health care system "is going broke and not working." We looked at the origins of the march and recent polling statistics about British public opinion on the National Health Service, commonly called the NHS. We also looked at the current funding situation, since Trump’s claim suggests it’s losing money. We found that Trump’s tweet gives a misleading impression about how the British public feels about its health care system. Public support for NHS University of North Carolina health policy professor and deputy director of the Cecil G. Sheps Center for Health Services Research, Thomas C. Ricketts, told PolitiFact that the NHS probably has higher public support than any other government program in the UK. Public support for the NHS being maintained in its current form remains high according to a poll by Ipsos; 77 percent of people support this, while 9 in 10 people think the founding principles of the NHS should still apply to services today. Two-thirds of adults are willing to pay more of their own taxes to pay for the NHS. In a poll by YouGov last year, 84 percent of people were in favor of the service continuing to be run by the public sector. Helen Howson, the director of the Bevan Commission, an independent think tank for health in Wales, is working to find ways to improve the system while maintaining the principles set out at its founding. "The NHS is a service which was set up to ensure that no one would be disadvantaged on the basis of their ability to pay, and people are passionate about these principles," she said. The NHS march, officially named, "NHS in crisis: Fix it now" was organized by the People’s Assembly, an independent, national campaign against austerity and Health Campaigns Together, a coalition defending the NHS. This year marks 70 years of NHS existence in the U.K., but the health care system has gone through what has been described as the worst winter in its recent history. The lack of funding is often blamed on austerity measures put forth by the Conservative Party and there have been concerns raised over privatizing parts of the system. Trump’s comments regarding the demonstration received immediate response by British officials, such as Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, who said people were marching because they love the NHS and hate what is being happening to it by the current party in power. Health minister Jeremy Hunt, who was largely blamed for the severe lack of winter funding, hit back at Trump’s remarks, writing on Twitter that not one of the marchers "wants to live in a system where 28m people have no cover." Growing concerns This is not to say that people don’t have concerns about the NHS. In a poll released last summer by the British Medical Association, more people are unhappy with the NHS than satisfied for the first time in the public poll run by British doctors. It showed that 70 percent of people think the health service is going in the wrong direction. The poll shows that 43 percent of respondents are dissatisfied with the service, which is double the number of dissatisfaction percentage in only two years. About 33 percent of respondents say they are satisfied. The poll also concluded that 82 percent of people are worried about the future of the NHS, 62 percent expect the NHS to get worse in the coming years and only 13 percent think that it will improve. The leading concerns of the respondents included a lack of funding, the possibility that the NHS may cease to be free at the point of use, increased waiting times and a lack of attention given to the service because of Brexit. Democrats’ push Trump also claimed that Democrats are pushing a similar health care plan to the NHS in the United States. Democrats have devised plans ranging from a total-government "Medicare for all," also known as a single-payer health system, to a more limited "public option" that pits individual government-run plans up against private insurance for people who weren’t able to find affordable coverage in Obamacare. The latter allows Americans to gain access to government insurance alongside private health care plans. The current version of Obamacare, more formally known as the Affordable Care Act, has little resemblance to the NHS, where the government owns most of the hospitals and clinics, and doctors and nurses are government employees. Our ruling Trump said, "The Democrats are pushing for Universal HealthCare while thousands of people are marching in the UK because their U system is going broke and not working. Dems want to greatly raise taxes for really bad and non-personal medical care. No thanks!" While the NHS has lost funding over the years, the march that took place was not in opposition to the service, but a call to increase funding and stop austerity cuts towards health and social care. The march resulted because people want universal health care to work better, not because they want it taken over by the private sector. We rate this Mostly False.

pomt-10921	Says Foxconn "is under investigation in mainland China for securities fraud, environmental fraud and labor fraud."	mostly false	/wisconsin/statements/2018/jul/31/matt-flynn/flynns-claims-against-foxconn-fall-short-actual-fr/	Ever since Gov. Scott Walker signed a $3 billion agreement with Taiwan-based Foxconn, the world’s largest contract electronics manufacturer, the deal has been an object of controversy in Wisconsin politics. The complaints from Democratic gubernatorial candidates have ranged from the size of the deal to the cost per new job to the environmental impact of the plant. Matt Flynn, one of eight remaining hopefuls, offered a different one in an April 12, 2018, interview with Green Bay’s WFRV-TV. In the interview, Flynn claimed Foxconn "is under investigation in mainland China for securities fraud, environmental fraud and labor fraud." That's quite a lot of fraud. But is the claim itself fraudulent or on target? When we asked Flynn's campaign to provide backup for the claims, it cited several news articles detailing various investigations into Foxconn's activities. We made our own checks as well. All the articles cited refer to past investigations rather than ongoing ones, as claimed by Flynn, and they did not necessarily discover any instances of fraud. Additionally, most of the investigations cited were not official governmental reviews, as implied by Flynn’s statement. Rather, they were conducted by advocacy groups and media organizations. Let’s take a look at each of the areas Flynn cited. The environment Flynn said Foxconn is under investigation for environmental fraud. When asked for backup, his campaign cited a 2013 investigation by Chinese regulators after allegations the electronics supplier had dumped heavy toxic metals into canals that lead to a nearby river. The campaign also cited another investigation, though this one was not government-led: Pressured by environmental groups, Apple in 2012 agreed to conduct independent environmental reviews of some of its suppliers, including Foxconn. Steph Tai, a professor at the University of Wisconsin Law School, framed it this way: An environmental violation is noncompliance with environmental law, whereas environmental fraud is concealing the fact of that noncompliance. They are different legal categories. But the boundary between the two categories is often hazy. Last year, a firm owned by Foxconn subsidiary FIH mobile in Hebei province’s Langfang city tried to stop the Chinese environment ministry's pollution inspectors from making checks during a nationwide investigation of more than 3,000 companies. Does this constitute violating environmental laws or environmental fraud? According to Tai, it could be both, because most operating permits require a company to allow inspectors inside. Preventing inspectors from making checks would thus violate the dictates of the permit. "If this sounds like such claims could overlap a lot, don't worry," said Tai. "They often do in these kinds of cases." Flynn’s campaign disputed Tai’s definition of fraud, arguing that fraud encompasses a broader range of illegal activities than concealment. Labor A similar absence of government-led inquiries and legal ambiguities plague Flynn's claim on the subject of labor fraud. It is true that Foxconn has been investigated multiple times for alleged labor abuses, though none of the investigations were government-led. More importantly, none of the investigations are ongoing. Most recently, between August 2017 and April 2018, the U.S.-based advocacy group China Labor Watch investigated the Hengyang Foxconn plant in Hunan province, which primarily manufactures Amazon Echo Dot and Kindle devices. The group identified numerous labor violations, including excessive hours, low wages, and inadequate training. Peak production season saw employees putting in more than 100 overtime hours per month, far beyond the 36 hours allowed under Chinese law. In some instances, employees worked 14 consecutive days. About 40 percent of the workforce was comprised of "dispatch" workers (temporary, low-cost, agency-recruited staffers) -- far in excess of the 10 percent limit under Chinese law. Dispatch workers had limited pre-job safety training, underpaid overtime hours and unpaid sick leave. Still, China Labor Watch declined to identify these labor violations as labor fraud. "I cannot say for certain whether our findings would constitute as labor fraud," said Winnie Shen, a program assistant at China Labor Watch, in an email. In 2012, the New York Times published an investigation into labor violations at Foxconn, including extended overtime and crowded living conditions for workers. It also documented multiple factory explosions caused by combustible aluminum dust, which had amassed in high concentrations due to poor ventilation. Later that year, an audit of three of Foxconn's Apple facilities and over 35,000 workers by the Fair Labor Association, a collaborative initiative between universities and businesses that promotes workers’ rights, unearthed labor abuses not dissimilar from those recently found by China Labor Watch. During peak production, employees worked an average number of hours that exceeded Chinese legal limits. The Fair Labor Association also found that 14 percent of workers potentially didn't receive fair compensation for unscheduled overtime. Later that year, Foxconn reached an agreement with Apple to improve conditions for millions of workers assembling iPhones and iPads. The FLA later confirmed Foxconn had improved working conditions ahead of schedule, though employees still described these measures as insufficient. The FLA’s report has also been subject to criticism. Some other examples of Foxconn’s labor violations: In 2006, the British newspaper The Mail reported on extensive hours, low wages, crowded dorms and military-style drills. In 2010, a rash of workers committed suicide to raise awareness of poor labor conditions. Foxconn responded by pledging to improve working conditions and installing netting around dormitories to catch falling workers. In 2012, 150 employees at the company's Wuhan production facility threatened to commit suicide over a wage dispute. Whether the company's persistent violations of Chinese labor law constitutes fraud is the question. "To me, fraud does not seem like the right word," said Mary Gallagher, director of the Lieberthal-Rogel Center for Chinese Studies at the University of Michigan. She noted that an example of fraud would be "keeping two sets of working time reports, so that it appears to be no violations of overtime." Again, however, the Flynn campaign argued that fraud encompasses a broader range of illegal activities than concealment. Securities In this case, the Flynn campaign did cite an official government investigation: an initial public offering (IPO) review of the company conducted by the China Securities Regulatory Commission, which scrutinized all of Foxconn’s present and past transactions. Such reviews are part of the standard procedure for being granted an IPO. As such, Flynn’s statement is misleading because it implies that Foxconn was investigated for a specific legal breach rather than as part of a standard procedure. The first statement suggests malice, the second suggests nothing. Moreso, the Chinese securities regulatory investigation concluded on March 8, 2018. Flynn made his claim on April 12. As such, Foxconn would not have been under investigation for securities fraud at the time he made his statement, as he implied. Although not cited by the Flynn campaign, reports show Foxconn has been investigated for bribery. In 2013, authorities in Taiwan investigated allegations that Foxconn Technology employees had accepted bribes from the company's supply-chain partners. They eventually detained several former executives. According to Foxconn, it had requested an investigation from authorities after an internal audit uncovered a few violations -- though the company insisted these violations were limited in scope. So while Chinese authorities did briefly look into Foxconn for alleged bribery, the scope of the investigation was extremely limited, and it is not clear that it found any instances of securities violations, let alone securities fraud. The Flynn campaign also cited two blog posts that described questionable business practices at Foxconn. But neither related to a formal investigation, let alone an ongoing one. As for Foxconn, the company issued a statement to us that read: "Foxconn can state that there is no truth to the claim made by Mr. Flynn regarding our company’s operations in China. Foxconn is committed to fulfilling our responsibilities as a global industry leader and good corporate citizen. As part of that commitment, Foxconn works hard to ensure we comply with all relevant laws and regulations in all markets where we operate." Our rating Flynn claimed that Foxconn "is under investigation in mainland China for securities fraud, labor fraud and environmental fraud." But all of the investigations cited by Flynn are old. The violations uncovered by some do not necessarily constitute fraud, while a few others did not find any violations at all. Much of the evidence cited comes from outside groups, including advocacy groups and even media companies, rather than the government. We rate Flynn’s claim Mostly False. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com This article was changed on July 31, 2018 to say the deal Walker signed provides state subsidies of up to $3 billion, not $4 billion.

pomt-05886	Public education has been permanently cut "by $1.6 billion through changes in the Standards of Quality funding formula."	mostly true	/virginia/statements/2012/feb/07/kitty-boitnott/kitty-boitnott-says-virginia-has-cut-16-billion-mi/	The Virginia Education Association says the state has been saving money by lowering public school standards. "Since the 2008 General Assembly, we have permanently cut biennial funding for public education by $1.6 billion through changes in the Standards of Quality funding formula," VEA President Kitty Boitnott said in a Jan. 23 news conference. The $1.6 billion cited by Boitnott is an eye-popping number. We wanted to know if her figure is correct and if the loss of the funding is, as she said "permanent." The Standards of Quality are minimum mandates Virginia sets forth for public education on teacher-pupil ratios, benefits for educators and basic curricula. The General Assembly sets the benchmarks every two years after considering recommendations by the state Board of Education. Virginia is required by law to pay 55 percent of the overall cost of the SOQs and local school districts must pay the rest. For this two-year budget cycle, which began July 1, 2010, the state will pay about $9.6 billion toward meeting the SOQs, and localities will pay about $7.8 billion. Boitnott is essentially saying the state obligation would have been $1.6 billion higher if the General Assembly had not taken steps since 2008 to lower Virginia’s education standards. Robley Jones, the VEA’s director of government relations, said Boitnott’s figures came from a report on education funding released last month by the Senate Finance Committee. The study contained a table detailing the 10 "substantive" reductions to public education programs approved by the General Assembly since 2008. The cuts came to a biennial total of $1.57 billion, and Boitnott rounded up. The biggest savings came from reducing the number of support positions -- such as clerks, teacher aides and bus drivers -- required by the state. That action removed $754 million in SOQ obligations. Lawmakers in 2010 found another $513 million in savings by eliminating certain types of equipment and travel from SOQ calculations and changing the formula for estimating health care costs for school employees. Boitnott, however, is slightly off in her analysis of the the Senate Finance Committee’s data. The table makes no claim that the 10 cut education programs it lists were part of the SOQs, as Boitnott suggests. In fact, four of the items were not part of the state’s minimum requirements, according to Charles Pyle, a spokesman for the Department of Education. They account for $174 million in biennial costs. So the real reduction in SOQ mandates comes to about $1.4 billion per biennium. Jones, who provided the information for Boitnott’s statement, said he made an inadvertent mistake in computing the SOQ reductions. That brings us down to one last question: Are the cuts to the SOQ formula permanent, as Boitnott says? Technically, they are not. The General Assembly is free to restore the funding, but that is not likely to happen. Julie Grimes, a spokeswoman at the Department of Education, said officials there cannot recall an instance where legislators cut funding for an SOQ program and later replenished it. When the state reduces funding for SOQ programs, localities often absorb the costs. Most school districts in Virginia are not satisfied with just attaining minimum SOQ standards and fund their schools at far greater levels than the state demands. The SOQs allow legislators to claim they fund 55 percent of the state’s educational mandates. But a different picture emerges when total expenditures on Virginia public education are computed. The localities pay about 50 percent, the state, the state pays 40 percent and roughly 10 percent comes from the federal government. Our ruling: Boitnott said that since 2008, the legislature has permanently cut $1.6 billion in programs from the state’s formula for funding public schools. She’s a bit off; the actual figure is $1.4 billion. Boitnott said these losses are "permanent." The General Assembly could restore funding, but a spokesman at the state Department of Education said officials cannot recall an instance where lawmakers cut an SOQ program and later reversed themselves.

pomt-05477	"Tourism accounts for 439,000 jobs in the state of Ohio, and visitors spend $36 billion annually."	true	/ohio/statements/2012/apr/20/mike-dovilla/mike-dovilla-says-tourism-ohio-accounts-439000-job/	The Ohio Department of Development was in Republican Gov. John Kasich’s crosshairs before he even was elected. Kasich has never been shy about ripping the department as a sluggish bureaucracy unable to keep pace with the modern business world. Since taking office last year, Kasich has worked to overhaul the department through privatization and other means. Such dramatic changes have required the help of state lawmakers, and GOP members of the House of Representatives and the Senate have been supportive of Kasich’s plan to reform the department. GOP lawmakers unveiled legislation – House Bill 489 and its companion, Senate Bill 314 – in March that proposes several new changes to the Department of Development, or what remains of it. The department’s economic development responsibilities last year were transferred to JobsOhio, a private nonprofit corporation that Kasich proposed and lawmakers approved. A key provision of the new legislation establishes TourismOhio, an agency that would, through a five-year pilot program, replace the department’s tourism division. State Rep. Mike Dovilla, a Republican from Berea who is a primary sponsor of HB 489, said funding for TourismOhio would be linked to sales-tax revenues from tourism-related industries. Dovilla also talked about the connection between tourism and job creation. "According to recent figures, tourism accounts for 439,000 jobs in the state of Ohio, and visitors spend $36 billion annually," Dovilla said April 12 in a news release from his office announcing TourismOhio. PolitiFact Ohio thought the robust figures Dovilla cited were worth a look, particularly since Kasich’s overhaul of the Department of Development has been a source of constant skepticism from Democrats from the beginning. Dovilla’s office pointed us down two paths to back up the figures for jobs and spending. Each however, lead us to the same source. That was Tourism Economics, a subsidiary of Oxford Economics, which is a joint venture that involves Oxford University’s business college and provides economic research and advice international organizations, governments and blue-chip companies. The state has hired Tourism Economics to monitor the economic impact of tourism in Ohio for about five years, said Amir Eylon, Ohio’s tourism director. The company is responsible for the estimates Dovilla cited for tourist spending in Ohio and the Ohio jobs supported by tourism. In its report, it notes that the data it collects is cross checked against figures from the federal Bureau of Labor Statistics. Eylon said Tourism Economics’ economic impact estimates are credible and consistent with other metrics he monitors. Tourism Economics’ report released in May 2011, "The Economic Impact of Tourism in Ohio," contained the jobs statistic. The report, which measured employment in 2010, said that 326,964 jobs were directly related to tourism while another 112,109 jobs were indirectly linked to tourism. Indirect employment figures include jobs that are sustained when tourism-related industries spend money. It also includes jobs that are supported by the spending of workers whose jobs are directly tied to tourism. Taken together, Ohio tourism supported 439,073 jobs, according to the report. The inclusion of indirect jobs for evaluating economic impact is not uncommon, but it’s also one worth explaining since in this case they account for about 26 percent of the jobs involved. The average listener might not realize that the total figure includes not just jobs such as those of hotel workers, but also jobs that rely on the patronage of those hotel workers who spend their wages on items such as gasoline or groceries. The $36 billion spending figure Dovilla cited is slightly out of date. Tourism Economics provided that figure to Ohio’s tourism division in 2010. More recently, Tourism Economics reported in May 2011 that Ohio tourism generated $38 billion in sales in 2010, up $2 billion from the previous year. While overall spending increased $2 billion from 2009 to 2010, hotel occupancy increased about 6 percent over that time, and revenue from room sales increased slightly less than 6 percent, according to the Ohio Hotel and Lodging Association. Dovilla’s statement is accurate. He has accurately cited figures for employment and spending prepared by credible researchers. And it’s true that the total jobs figure he cited includes 112,109 indirect jobs that are not supported by consumers spending tourism dollars, but rather by the spending habits of the tourism industry and its employees. But inclusion of such indirect jobs is not unusual for assessing economic impact. On the Truth-O-Meter, Dovilla’s claim rates True.

pomt-12900	"The exodus of citizens from New York State has been growing."	true	/new-york/statements/2017/jan/20/edward-cox/new-york-losing-more-people-other-states-its-gaini/	Edward F. Cox, the chairman of the New York State Republican Committee, took exception when Gov. Andrew Cuomo said "the exodus has stopped" in New York state. "He said there is no exodus, we’ve stopped the exodus. Wrong – completely wrong," Cox said to reporters in Albany. "The exodus of citizens from New York state has been growing, it’s never been larger. That’s an absolute fraudulent statement the governor made, that the net exodus of citizens from New York state has been stopped under his regime. Absolutely wrong. That’s a lie and he knew it was." Is Cox right? Are more people moving out of New York state than moving in? Cuomo’s comment The problem with Cox's statement, according to a Cuomo spokesman, is that Cox misinterpreted what the governor said during his regional State of the State address in Buffalo. Cuomo said: "So we got the spending down. It allowed us to get the taxes down, and that’s why you see a new attitude where businesses believe they’re welcome in New York, families believe they’re welcome in New York. The exodus has stopped, the job growth has started." Cuomo's statement left room for interpretation, but PolitiFact New York evaluated that claim in July 2016 and rated it True. Source: New York State Department of Labor Census data Cox interpreted Cuomo's statement as about people. The U.S. Census Bureau tracks how many people move in and move from states each year. Between April 2010 and July 2016, the latest data available, 846,669 more people moved out of New York state than moved in. That's the largest outflow in the country. Source: U.S. Census Bureau The state’s population increased by 367,719 people in the same time period thanks to births and international migration. Cuomo took office in January 2011. Leaving out data between July 2010 and July 2011 still leaves the state with a net domestic migration loss of about 723,000 between 2011 and 2016. The exodus from New York state is not new. The trend goes back decades. Our ruling Cuomo and Cox are like ships passing in the night. Cuomo's statement was previously rated True. And Cox's version of the statement - '"the exodus of citizens from New York state has been growing" - is verified by census data.

pomt-03459	"Some of these members of the House of Representatives get hundreds of thousands of dollars in farm subsidies" but want to cut food stamps.	true	/ohio/statements/2013/jun/18/sherrod-brown/sen-sherrod-brown-says-lawmakers-who-take-farm-sub/	Congress is deciding whether to reform the nation’s farm subsidy system and, while it is at it, will probably cut the amount it dedicates to food stamps for the poor and low-income workers. Both programs are part of what’s known as the farm bill, the five-year authorization that sets the terms for government crop assistance and defines eligibility for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP. It turns out that some Congress members receive farm subsidies themselves, or get them through farms and corporations they and their relatives own. Whether they should or shouldn’t is not for us to say. Proponents and opponents of the subsidies, primarily direct payments made to farm owners, can be found in both political parties. But U.S. Sen. Sherrod Brown, an Ohio Democrat, finds it disconcerting that some of the lawmakers who gladly take the government’s subsidies want to cut SNAP, or subsidies to people who need help buying groceries. Discussing the 2013 farm bill, which recently passed in the Senate and is under debate in the House, Brown told reporters on a conference call on June 12, "There's a lot of pressure in the House of Representatives to just emasculate the SNAP program. For whatever reason, some of these members of the House of Representatives get hundreds of thousands of dollars in farm subsidies. They think they earned that, and on the other hand, then they want to cut food stamps, and I think that's morally wrong." We cannot read the minds of subsidy recipients, so we will not judge whether Congress members -- who earn $174,000 federal salaries -- think they have earned the right to farm subsidies. But Brown’s claim struck us as worth examining. Examples were easy to find. The Environmental Working Group, or EWG, an advocacy and research group, maintains a database of federal farm subsidies and has run lawmakers’ names to see what they or their families are getting. News organizations have used this database (and the public can, too), and some have noted where the recipients stand on food stamps, or SNAP. For instance: * Rep. Steve Fincher of Tennessee, "who supports billions of dollars in cuts to the food stamp program," is "one of the largest recipients of federal farm subsidies, according to new annual data released by a Washington environmental group." This was in the New York Times on May 22. Fincher, from Frog Jump, Tenn., and his wife "collected nearly $3.5 million in subsidies from 1999 to 2012," reported the Times, using EWG data. In 2012 alone, the couple received about $70,000 in direct payments, which is "money that is given to farmers and farmland owners, even if they do not grow crops," the Times wrote. During debate in May on whether to cut $20.5 billion from SNAP over the next 10 years, Fincher, a Republican, said, "We have to remember there is not a big printing press in Washington that continually prints money over and over. This is other people’s money that Washington is appropriating and spending." * Rep. Doug LaMalfa of California and his wife, Jill, together own one third of DSL LaMalfa Family Partnership, which in 2012 alone got $188,570 in direct farm payments from the federal government, according to the EWG. That would put last year’s subsidies to LaMalfa and his wife at $62,857. But going back to 1995, the DSL LaMalfa Family Partnership has received $5.13 million, which would put the share of Rep. LaMalfa and his wife at $1.7 million, EWG said. In May, LaMalfa won a House amendment that would require electronic fraud prevention measures and eliminate bonus pay for signing up new SNAP recipients. He said in a statement then, "The success of the food stamp program should be measured by how many Americans become self-sufficient, not how many are added to the rolls." * Rep. Marlin Stutzman of Indiana has received $196,268 in farm subsidies since 1997, according to the EWG. Stutzman, a Republican, recently proposed cutting SNAP by $30 billion over 10 years, deeper than the $20.5 billion now on the table, saying, "Everyone in Washington talks about deficit reduction but we’ve introduced a real, responsible plan to save taxpayer dollars. Over the past decade, SNAP spending has doubled as this program outgrows its original mission of providing temporary assistance." The list goes on. The Wall Street Journal and Bloomberg, both reviewing the same EWG data as other media, noted that 15 members of Congress got farm subsidies in 2012. (None were from Ohio.) Thirteen were Republicans and two were Democrats. The Democrats were in the Senate -- Michael Bennett of Colorado and Jon Tester of Montana, who says he is the Senate’s only "working farmer." Both voted June 10 for the Senate version of the farm bill, which would cut SNAP by $4 billion, or about $16 billion less than the House GOP leaders want. Brown, too, voted for the bill after failing to get the SNAP cut restored. It’s fairly obvious where this leaves Brown’s claim that some House members accepted "hundreds of thousands of dollars" in farm subsidies but are eager to cut food stamps. But before ruling, we’ll note in fairness that some of the farm-subsidy recipients told the Wall Street Journal that the farm programs need reform, too. Fincher issued a statement saying, "I voted immediately to remove direct payments," the Journal wrote. And, the Journal added, a spokesman for LaMalfa said the lawmaker has long opposed the farm-subsidy system and voted to end direct payments. In Stutzman’s case, the receipt of subsidies was a political issue in his 2010 election. But he maintained to the Fort Wayne Journal Gazette that the farm-support system is like a mandate, giving him no choice. The farmer "has to take it," he told the Journal Gazette in 2010. The U.S. Department of Agriculture said the program is voluntary. OK, so maybe he and the others didn’t like it one bit when they got farm subsidies. We’re not here to judge their motives. But we are here to judge Brown’s claim. It is True.	None	Sherrod Brown	None	None	None	2013-06-18T11:43:37	2013-06-12	['None']
pomt-05024	Says he "never supported" federal health care individual mandate.	false	/wisconsin/statements/2012/jul/15/tommy-thompson/gop-wisconsin-senate-candidate-thompson-says-he-ne/	Among conservatives, a hated provision of federal health care reform is the "individual mandate," which requires Americans (with some exceptions) to buy health insurance. That sentiment has left Republican Tommy Thompson in a difficult spot as he vies with three opponents in the August 2012 primary for U.S. Senate. The former governor and U.S. health and human services secretary has made statements for and against the health care reform legislation that eventually became law. That led us to rate Half True a claim by the national Club for Growth, a conservative group, that Thompson supported "Obamacare." On June 13, 2012, two weeks before the U.S. Supreme Court declared most of the reform law constitutional, Thompson issued two Internet statements about the individual mandate. In one message from a Twitter account for his campaign, Thompson said he "didn’t support the individual mandate." And in the other tweet, directed at Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee spokesman Matt Canter, he went further, stating: "Can’t back down from something (i.e. the individual mandate) that you never supported, Canter." Taken together, Thompson is claiming he "never supported" the individual mandate. Never is pretty absolute, so let’s check the record. Opponents’ evidence Arguing that Thompson did support the mandate, Canter cited a video clip released by the Washington, D.C.-based Club for Growth the day before the Supreme Court ruling. (While the national Club for Growth has repeatedly attacked Thompson, and is supporting Republican Mark Neumann in the Senate race, the Wisconsin chapter has not.) In the clip, Thompson speaks at a national health care reform forum at American University in Washington, D.C. At the April 2006 event, held more than two years before Obama’s election, Thompson refers to reform in Massachusetts, saying: "You’ve also got to consider strongly -- and I happen to support that, what Massachusetts did -- and that is requiring health insurance, the coverage of health insurance. This is a little bit opposed to what Republicans really think or propose. But the truth of the matter is, just like automobile insurance, you’ve got to have coverage. And if you’re going to be able to cover the uninsured, you’re going to have to have some degree of a mandate to cover the uninsured." Both Canter and Club for Growth also cited video of a University of Texas speech in February 2007 in which Thompson says: "I, for one, believe the mandate for health insurance is all right. We mandate insurance for automobiles. You know you can’t drive in Texas without automobile insurance. You can’t drive in any state without automobile insurance. It’s a mandate, but it’s certainly something that we should discuss in this country, and I think that’s positive." So, Thompson said he supported Massachusetts’ health insurance requirement and said such a mandate is "all right," although both statements were made before Obama’s reform efforts were launched. Thompson’s evidence To defend Thompson’s claim, his campaign spokesman, Brian Nemoir, said Thompson "is the only candidate who has testified before Congress against the mandates." He cited a portion of Thompson’s May 2008 testimony to the Senate Finance Committee: "I am not convinced that the individual mandate is the correct approach," Thompson said, according to a transcript. "We have seen in Massachusetts that the individual mandate approach is not effective at covering the most vulnerable part of the population, that part of the population which needs coverage the most." So, after the generally supportive statements in 2006 and 2007, Thompson in 2008, shortly before Obama’s election, indicated he did not support an individual mandate. Nemoir also cited an August 2011 report by the University of Pennsylvania-based FactCheck.org, which concluded that Club for Growth had falsely attacked Thompson as a "champion of Obamacare," and he provided statements saying Thompson opposes what eventually became law. But Thompson’s past or current positions on the overall reform are not at issue here. In our item about Club for Growth’s claim about Thompson, Thompson’s campaign noted that Thompson at a July 2008 forum on a "universal mandate" for health insurance said: "I don’t want a mandate." But moments later Thompson said: "I’m not opposed to it, I just don’t think it’s the most practical way." Our rating Thompson said he "never supported" an individual mandate. But while he is now an opponent of the health care reform law and its mandate requiring most Americans to buy health insurance, Thompson said in 2006 he supported a mandate and in 2007 said a mandate is "all right."

pomt-07844	A 5-cent charge on paper bags is a tax.	false	/oregon/statements/2011/feb/13/mark-daniels/mark-daniels-says-oregons-proposed-paper-bag-fee-t/	Opponents have raised a number of arguments to make their case against Senate Bill 536, which would ban plastic shopping bags and require retailers to charge a nickel per paper bag: It’s the elimination of choice at the checkout. It’s based on lies by the environmental community. And yes -- they went there -- it’s a tax on sacks. At a public hearing, Mark Daniels, a vice president from Hilex Poly Co., said the proposal would force consumers to "pay a tax on paper bags." To that, bag-ban champion Sen. Mark Hass, D-Beaverton, jumped in and said the nickel charge is not a tax, and pointed to a Legislative Counsel opinion showing so. The next day, the Taxpayer Association of Oregon, which is opposed to the bag ban, accused Hass of trying to censor speech. So, we wanted to know, is a nickel charge on a paper bag a tax? Is it a de-facto tax? A tax has a very specific definition in Oregon government. It’s so specific that the state constitution calls for a higher number of votes-- three-fifths of each chamber -- to pass a tax than to pass a fee, which only requires a simple majority. Voters approved the change in May 1996, embedding the provision into the Oregon Constitution. In any case, to be a tax, it must raise revenue for the general treasury. Former legislative counsel Greg Chaimov agrees with the current Legislative Counsel opinion that the nickel provision is neither a tax nor a fee. "It’s whatever the grocers want to call it. For constitutional purposes, a fee or a tax is at issue only if it is bringing money into the government." Dexter Johnson, the current legislative counsel, said the bag charge would be most similar to the bottle bill deposit, also known as the "container deposit law." In Oregon and in other states, you have to pay a nickel extra for beer, soft drinks and bottled water; that money stays with distributors unless you return the bottle to the grocer for your nickel. And here’s another charge that doesn’t count as a tax or a fee. In 1999, state lawmakers ordered utility companies to assess a "public purpose charge" on electricity and gas bills. Much of the money goes to the nonprofit Energy Trust of Oregon, with some proceeds going to weatherize schools and low-income homes. Again, it doesn’t "raise revenue" because the money doesn’t go into state coffers -- even if the government dictates how the money should be spent. Back to the bag charge. The state doesn’t get any of that money. Grocers can spend the money however they want. And shoppers -- and this is critical -- don’t need to pay a nickel for a paper bag. They are free to bring in their own carrying devices, from gym bags to multi-use plastic bags to previously used paper bags. There is no constitutional right to a disposable sack. Anna Richter Taylor, a lobbyist representing Hilex, argues that for Oregonians who have never before had to pay for a supermarket bag, this is a tax. "The Legislature can call it what they want, but government -- and not grocers -- is forcing consumers to buy a reusable bag or a paper bag," she said. PolitiFact Oregon doesn’t like paying for something that once was free. But remember, television used to be free. Bottled drinks were once 5 cents cheaper. Utility companies used to not charge 3 percent extra for energy programs. Frankly, we think it’s easier to avoid the 5 cent charge on bags than it is to bypass bottled drinks or the public purpose charge on utility bills. We rate the claim False. Comment on this item.

pomt-08491	Says "Scott Walker says he would ban stem cell research"	false	/wisconsin/statements/2010/oct/10/tom-barrett/democratic-governor-candidate-tom-barrett-says-opp/	Stem cells hold the potential to treat, and even cure, some of our most deadly and debilitating illnesses, including heart disease, stroke, Alzheimer’s and diabetes. To make the cells do their magic, research is needed — and the University of Wisconsin has been at the forefront of that work. But for many people, there is a tension between conducting such research and protecting the sanctity of human life. The dilemma confronts not only scientists, but politicians, who are able to set government funding priorities and even place limits on the work scientists do. As in 2006, stem cell research has become an issue in the race for governor. Just as outgoing Gov, Jim Doyle did four years ago, Democratic nominee Tom Barrett is running a TV ad that paints his Republican opponent — Scott Walker — as extreme on the issue. The ad features a mother talking to the camera about her son, who has juvenile diabetes. She describes how stem cell research "gives our family hope, hope for a cure," and she continues with a blunt declaration: "Scott Walker says he would ban stem cell research in Wisconsin. That’s right, ban it." It is the mother making the statement. But as the candidate, Barrett is responsible for the content of the ad. Indeed, as the mother speaks, the words "Scott Walker says he would ban stem cell research" appear on the screen. Before we can evaluate the accuracy of Barrett’s claim, we need a brief explanation of stem cells and the current state of science. Here are some key points from a primer by the National Institutes of Health: Stem cells are important for two reasons: As a generic type of cell, stem cells can renew themselves through cell division. Moreover, they can be induced to become specific tissue or organ cells that have special functions. That gives stem cells their potential to treat, and someday even cure, a number of diseases. Scientists work with two types of stem cells: embryonic and adult. Embryonic stem cells are derived from an embryo, which science defines as the "developing organism from the time of fertilization until the end of the eighth week of gestation, when it is called a fetus." Adult stem cells, in contrast, come not from a developing organism but from the body. Embryonic stem cells have a crucial advantage: With regard to treating diseases, embryonic stem cells can become all cell types of the body. Adult stem cells are thought to be limited to differentiating into different cell types of their tissue of origin. The embryonic-adult distinction is critical, though it is not mentioned in the TV ad. The mother in the ad is Heidi Fallone. She and her husband, Edward, are two of the six members of the board of directors of Wisconsin Stem Cell Now, a group that advocates specifically for embryonic stem cell research. Heidi Fallone’s connection to the group is not mentioned in the ad. She is presented as an average mother, with her message packing an emotional wallop as strong as the words: Walker would ban stem cell research. In truth, Walker’s comments on the topic have expressed support for stem cell research generally — but not if it involves embryos. It is a line that many candidates have drawn, including Mark Green, who was the subject of Doyle’s attack in 2006. In his ad, Doyle used a Verona mother, pictured with her young daughter, who has diabetes. The mother said Green would "outlaw stem cell research." In the 2010 campaign, Walker and his campaign staff have issued various statements, including two in August, that spell out his position. In one, a day after a U.S. district judge shut down federal funding of all research involving embryonic stem cells, a Walker aide said, "We can realize the potential of stem cell research without destroying human embryos or resorting to human cloning. We can both protect the earliest stages of life and find cures." In another statement, also in the wake of the judge’s ruling, Walker himself said that "science has shown us repeatedly that you can have successful stem cell research without destroying a human embryo." As an alternative to embryonic stem cell research, researchers have been developing techniques to reprogram adult cells back to the embryonic state. But recent studies have revealed problems. The reprogrammed cells appear to retain a memory of their previous role — as skin, for example — and differ in subtle ways from embryonic stem cells. In response to questions, the Barrett campaign has defended its TV ad. Campaign spokesman Phil Walzak told the Associated Press: "Embryonic stem cell research is stem cell research, Walker wants to ban it — he wants to ban stem cell research." The statement, though, shifts the debate. No one disputes that Walker opposes embryonic stem cell research. As additional support, Walzak provided PolitiFact Wisconsin two newspaper articles and a survey Walker completed for the group Pro-Life Wisconsin. But the material, like other items cited, showed only that Walker opposes embryonic stem cell research, not that he wants to ban all stem cell research. In an interview, Walzak said the Barrett ad is accurate because it is widely known that only embryonic stem cell research — not adult stem cell research — is being debated in terms of a research ban. However, since the ad began running, Barrett has altered his message. An e-mail sent by Barrett’s campaign to supporters, signed by Fallone, says Walker would ban "critical" stem cell research. It goes on to criticize Walker’s opposition to embryonic stem cell research. If anything, that underlines how inaccurate the TV ad’s language is. So, where does that leave us? Democrat Tom Barrett is running a TV ad claiming his opponent for governor, Republican Scott Walker, "would ban stem cell research in Wisconsin." In truth, Walker has repeatedly said he supports research involving adult stem cells, but opposes research involving embryonic stem cells. That is a critical distinction in the world of science — and of politics. Barrett’s ad ignores it, presenting Walker as so extreme on the matter that he is "against hope." We rate Barrett’s claim False.	None	Tom Barrett	None	None	None	2010-10-10T09:00:00	2010-10-01	['None']

pomt-05792	On mandatory ultrasounds before abortions.	no flip	/virginia/statements/2012/feb/24/bob-mcdonnell/mcdonnells-support-mandatory-ultrasounds-abortions/	Across the country and around the world, pundits are saying Gov. Bob McDonnell performed a career-defining flip-flop Wednesday by urging fellow Republicans in the General Assembly to ease legislation mandating ultrasounds before an abortion. The Guardian in London called it a "U-Turn;" Al Sharpton on "PoliticsNation" called it a "huge turn-around;" Slate called it a "backtrack." Politico wrote: "The conservative blogosphere collectively bemoaned Virginia Gov. Bob McDonnell’s decision to withdraw his support for legislation requiring invasive ultrasounds to be performed before abortions." The narrative, in many of the stories, is that McDonnell’s action will harm his chances to become the vice-presidential candidate on the Republican national ticket this year. So we wheeled out our Flip-O-Meter to see if McDonnell really did change his position in the ultrasound controversy. On the morning of Jan. 31, during an interview on WTOP radio, McDonnell announced his support of legislation requiring physicians, before an performing an abortion, to conduct an ultrasound and present the image of the fetus to the mother. Here’s an excerpt from his talk with broadcaster Mark Segraves: Segraves: "But what do you support – the idea of having a woman have to take a sonogram before getting an abortion? Is that something you would support?" McDonnell: "An ultrasound – yes, I actually was the original sponsor of that bill about 10 years ago, to give a woman the right to know all the information before she makes the choice." Segraves: "Well, giving her the right to know and mandating a procedure are two completely different things." McDonnell: "Yeah, but I think it gives full information – an ultrasound is used – it’s modern technology, the costs have been driven down, to be able to have that information before making, what most people say is a very important, serious, life-changing decision, I think, is appropriate." McDonnell didn’t get into the types of ultrasounds or the details of the bill. And the legislation did not specify any type of sonogram that must be performed. Several hours later, debate on the Senate floor cast the bill in a new light. Several Democrats, for the first time, argued that the common "jelly on the belly" abdominal sonogram -- in which a wand is rubbed over a woman’s stomach -- may not be sensitive enough to render the image of a fetus in the first months of pregnancy. In such cases, they said, the abortion law would require physicians to conduct invasive transvaginal ultrasounds -- even against a mother’s will -- to get an image. The first news account disclosing that the bill would require transvaginal ultrasounds ran on Feb. 3. After that, the story went viral. The bill, which critics called "state-sanctioned rape," earned the ridicule from Jon Stewart and Saturday Night Live. More than 1,000 people protested at the state Capitol on Feb. 21. Then, on Feb. 22, McDonnell urged the Republican-controlled General Assembly to amend the bill so that no woman would be required to have a transvaginal ultrasound. In a written statement, the governor said he had been initially unaware that the legislation would require the invasive procedure. "I have come to understand that the medical practice and standard of care currently guide physicians to use other procedures to find the gestational age of the child, when abdominal ultrasounds cannot do so," McDonnell wrote. The House amended the bill as the governor requested. The measure is pending in the Senate. So, is there any evidence McDonnell reversed himself on mandatory transvaginal ultrasounds before an abortion? The answer is no. The governor, on Jan. 31, endorsed the general concept of mandating ultrasounds before abortions. Hours later, several senate Democrats revealed the legislation would require some use of transvaginal ultrasounds, even against a woman’s will. There is no record that McDonnell ever endorsed or defended mandatory use of the invasive procedure. Did McDonnell alter his long-held support for requiring women to undergo a non-invasive, external ultrasound before an abortion? The answer, again, is no. He still backs that. Despite all the uproar, we cannot find any change in McDonnell’s stance. We rate this No Flip.	None	Bob McDonnell	None	None	None	2012-02-24T13:16:12	2012-02-22	['None']
pomt-01986	Under Gov. Scott Walker, "employer confidence now stands at 95 percent," compared to "only 10 percent" at the end of the "Gov. Jim Doyle-Mary Burke administration."	mostly false	/wisconsin/statements/2014/jun/15/republican-party-wisconsin/employer-confidence-sky-high-under-gov-scott-walke/	Gov. Scott Walker has used surveys by Wisconsin Manufacturers and Commerce, the state’s largest business group and a key supporter of his, to make statements about how good business leaders feel about Wisconsin since he took office. Some of the claims have been off the mark. In February 2012, Walker said 94 percent of Wisconsin employers think the state "is heading in the right direction" and a majority say they will "grow their companies in 2012." We rated his statement Half True. While the figures were cited correctly, they came from a relatively small Wisconsin Manufacturers and Commerce survey that was not reflective of the overall makeup of businesses in the state. Walker presented the figures without noting the critical limitations. On May 30, 2014, the Wisconsin Republican Party issued a statement about unemployment that contrasted Walker with Mary Burke, the leading Democratic candidate in the November 2014 gubernatorial election. Burke served as state commerce secretary under Walker's predecessor, Democrat Jim Doyle, for part of Doyle’s tenure. The GOP’s claim: "Under Walker, employer confidence now stands at 95 percent; at the end of the Doyle-Burke administration, employer confidence was only 10 percent." The GOP's evidence When we asked for evidence to back the claim, the party cited the latest WMC survey, which was released in January 2014. WMC said that from November through mid-December 2013, it sent surveys by mail and email to 1,291 chief executive officers who are WMC members, and that 341 (26 percent) responded. The GOP said its claim centered on Question 21, which asked: "Do you think things in Wisconsin are going in the right direction, or on the wrong track?" The results: Right direction -- 95 percent; Wrong track -- 5 percent. In contrast, in WMC’s June 2010 survey, the last done before Walker’s election, the figures were 10 percent "right direction," 90 percent "wrong track." But Burke served as Doyle’s commerce secretary for less than three years of Doyle’s eight-year tenure, leaving the post in November 2007. In WMC’s June 2007 survey, the final one before Burke left Commerce, 59 percent said things in Wisconsin were going in the right direction -- much greater than the 10 percent in the June 2010 survey. Moreover, like Walker's claim, the GOP claim was broad and without any qualifications. As stated, the claim suggests the overwhelmingly positive figures for Walker reflect the opinions of business leaders statewide. But as we noted in our Walker factcheck, the survey respondents don’t match up well with Wisconsin’s statewide business profile. A majority of survey respondents in the latest survey were chief executive officers of manufacturing businesses. But manufacturing establishments are just 6 percent of Wisconsin’s businesses. Similarly, WMC represents some small businesses, but half its 3,500 members have more than 50 employees. On more specific questions, the results of the latest survey weren’t quite as positive for Walker. For example: 44 percent of the responding CEOs said they planned to add employees in the next six months; 65 percent said they expected moderate growth in the Wisconsin economy in the next six months and 2 percent expected good growth. Our rating The state Republican Party said that under Walker, "employer confidence now stands at 95 percent," compared to "only 10 percent" at the end of the Doyle- Burke administration. The statement contains an element of truth, in that 95 percent of chief executive officers who are members of Wisconsin Manufacturers and Commerce, and who responded to the latest WMC survey, agreed that "things in Wisconsin are going in the right direction" rather than "on the wrong track." But the claim ignores critical facts in suggesting that the 95 percent figure applies to all Wisconsin employers, when in fact the CEOs responding to the survey are not a representative sample of all employers. And although only 10 percent said the state was going in the right direction at the end of Doyle’s term in 2010, the rate was 51 percent in the survey done shortly before Burke left Commerce in 2007. We rate the state GOP’s statement Mostly False.	None	Republican Party of Wisconsin	None	None	None	2014-06-15T05:00:00	2014-05-30	['None']
pomt-05128	Federal health care reforms amounted to ‘the government takeover of health care.’	pants on fire!	/wisconsin/statements/2012/jun/24/tommy-thompson/tommy-thompson-says-federal-health-care-reforms-ar/	Republican Tommy Thompson uses a farm field as a backdrop and a stop sign as a prop in a new television ad for his U.S. Senate campaign. The former governor rattles off a list of practices that he would "stop" if voters send him to Washington in November 2012: deficits, tax hikes,over-regulation of business. "And I’ll stop the government takeover of health care by repealing ‘Obamacare,’ " he concludes. Thompson is one of four candidates seeking the GOP nomination for the seat held by retiring U.S. Sen. Herb Kohl (D-Wis.). We asked Thompson campaign spokesman Brian Nemoir to explain the last item, about which plenty has been written. He provided this explanation. "The statement is ‘I’ll stop the government takeover of health care,’" Nemoir wrote in an email. But that skips the end of the sentence, which is the key: Thompson says he’ll stop the takeover "by repealing ‘Obamacare.’ " Did the federal health reforms -- part of a key case awaiting a U.S. Supreme Court ruling -- amount to "the government takeover of health care." Seems like we’ve been down this road a few times. Indeed, calling the 2010 health care reform bill a "government takeover of health care" was deemed the 2010 "Lie of the Year" by PolitiFact National. Readers also chose it as that year's most significant falsehood. It concluded that the statement "is simply not true." Here are some details from that item: • Employers will continue to provide health insurance to the majority of Americans through private insurance companies. • Contrary to the claim, more people will get private health coverage. The law sets up "exchanges" where private insurers will compete to provide coverage to people who don't have it. • Under the law, the government will not seize control of hospitals or nationalize doctors. • The law does not include the public option, a government-run insurance plan that would have competed with private insurers. • The law gives tax credits to people who have difficulty affording insurance, so they can buy their coverage from private providers on the exchange. But here too, the approach relies on a free market with regulations, not socialized medicine. PolitiFact National concluded: "PolitiFact reporters have studied the 906-page bill and interviewed independent health care experts. We have concluded it is inaccurate to call the plan a government takeover because it relies largely on the existing system of health coverage provided by employers." For his part, Nemoir said the law is "a mandated program reducing consumer health care choice coupled with massive increases in both cost and regulation of an industry impacting virtually all Americans, and currently responsible for nearly 20 percent of our GDP, seemingly fits the formally undefined, ‘government takeover.’" Nemoir also said Thompson, who served as U.S. Health and Human Services secretary under President George W. Bush, "has demonstrated leadership on tough issues throughout his career and is uniquely positioned as a health care expert." That may be true, but his resume is not at issue in the "government takeover" claim. Finally, Thompson suggests he would repeal the health care law by himself. Of course, there are 99 other senators, and the House of Representatives, and the president, who would have a say in it. But we think most would recognize that as Thompson simply stating his position, not claiming he could do it unilaterally. Our conclusion Thompson says in a TV ad that federal health reforms amount to "the government takeover of health care." It’s not a government takeover. We’ve said numerous times that characterizing the law in this way is a distortion of the facts -- and the 2010 Lie of the Year. We rate his claim Pants on Fire.

pomt-00995	Fundamental changes made to the language describing the Wisconsin Idea in the University of Wisconsin System's mission statement were the result of a "drafting error."	pants on fire!	/wisconsin/statements/2015/feb/06/scott-walker/despite-deliberate-actions-scott-walker-calls-chan/	Echoing other national media, U.S. News & World Report declared Feb. 3, 2015 that Gov. Scott Walker was having a better two-week run than any 2016 presidential hopeful. The very next day, Walker got caught in a political firestorm back home. News broke that language included in Walker’s state budget proposal would fundamentally change something known as the "Wisconsin Idea" -- a mission statement for the University of Wisconsin System that had been in place, and held in some esteem, for more than a century. The Wisconsin Idea doesn't have a precise meaning, but an early definition was: "The borders of the university are the borders of the state." In short, the Wisconsin Idea is a notion of public service, including the system’s contributions to state government as well as "research directed at solving problems that are important" to citizens. Today, the university system includes the flagship University of Wisconsin-Madison and 25 other campuses that comprise the $6 billion-per-year UW System. The backlash to Walker's proposal, even from some conservatives, was swift. So was Walker’s response. Using his official Twitter account, the governor stated on Feb. 4, 2015: "The Wisconsin Idea will continue to thrive. The final version of budget will fix drafting error -- Mission statement will include WI Idea." "Drafting error"? Really? Walker’s budget changes The day before his tweet, Walker had given his 2015-’17 state budget address. It made no mention of the Wisconsin Idea. The next day, the left-leaning Center for Media and Democracy, a Madison-based group, reported that the 1,800-page budget bill itself included language that, in effect, struck the Wisconsin Idea from the mission of the University of Wisconsin System. That mission is contained in a state statute. As shown in a photo accompanying this story, Walker’s budget deletes a number of phrases contained in the statute. Among the statements that are removed: "Extend knowledge and its application beyond the boundaries of its campuses"; and "Basic to every purpose of the system is the search for truth." With some added language, the edits to the language emphasized the mission should be to "meet the state’s workforce needs." How changes occurred Walker’s "drafting-error" explanation suggests the rewriting of the UW System's mission was some kind of mistake -- changes made inadvertently. Walker’s spokeswoman told us the governor had learned shortly before sending his tweet that "there was a miscommunication during the back and forth of the budget process." But the evidence indicates the changes to the Wisconsin Idea language were intentional. As revealed by the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, based on emails and other information gathered by the newspaper: As the budget was being prepared, Walker’s administration insisted to UW System officials that the changes to the Wisconsin Idea language be made. In December 2014, a budget analyst in Walker's Department of Administration directed the nonpartisan budget-writing office to remove the phrase "Basic to every purpose of the system is the search for truth" from the state statute covering the UW System's mission. In January 2015, the same analyst told the budget-writing office to remove another phrase: "To extend knowledge and its application beyond the boundaries of its campuses." Five days before Walker introduced his budget, a UW System official sent an email to Walker's budget staff raising concerns about the changes, saying: "We strongly urge that stricken language is unique to depicting the character, mission and vision of the UW System." That UW official, John Yingling, later told the Journal Sentinel that Walker’s budget staff responded by saying the changes would remain in the budget. Backtracking from earlier statements, Walker eventually admitted that UW System officials had thrown up red flags and been rebuffed -- although he also said there "was a confusion out there" and "it was a mistake that someone made." Walker’s office also issued a statement claiming that when his office told the budget staff to "keep it simple, they took that to mean that we only wanted workforce readiness language in the mission when we really wanted the language added to the existing mission statement.....It was a simple miscommunication during the natural back and forth of this process." Our rating Walker said fundamental changes to the language describing the Wisconsin Idea in the University of Wisconsin System's mission statement were the result of a "drafting error" in his state budget proposal. But Walker’s administration had insisted to UW System officials on making the changes, giving detailed instructions on passages to be removed from state law. And eventually Walker himself acknowledged that the UW System had objected to the changes before his budget was put into final form. His original claim was not only inaccurate, but ridiculous. Pants on Fire. To comment on this item, go to the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel’s web page. This item was revised on Feb. 6, 2015, so that it refers to a budget analyst in Walker's Department of Administration, rather than a Walker administration official. ------ More on Scott Walker For profiles and stories on Scott Walker and 2016 presidential politics, go to the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel's Scott Walker page.

pomt-14065	"The first tweet was sent from Austin."	pants on fire!	/texas/statements/2016/may/20/steve-adler/steve-adler-ridiculously-claims-first-tweet-was-se/	Austin Mayor Steve Adler, making a pitch for special transportation aid, made it clear he thinks of his city as an innovation capital. In part, he said later that day, that’s because the very first tweet was launched in the city. "Austin is where good ideas become real," Adler said in a May 17, 2016, morning meeting in Austin with U.S. Transportation Secretary Anthony Foxx. Later, Adler said during a "smart growth" panel discussion not involving Foxx: "The first tweet was sent from Austin." Austin American-Statesman technology reporter Lilly Rockwell sounded skeptical in her tweet reporting Adler’s claim to history: "Hmm, @MayorAdler claims the first tweet was sent from Austin. I know it became popular at #SXSW but was the first tweet really sent here?" We wondered too. To our inquiry, mayoral spokesman Jason Stanford said Adler occasionally makes his first-tweet-from-Austin claim "as shorthand for how Twitter became real when it came to SXSW. He often says that Austin is where good ideas become real, and he likes to cite Twitter as an example, though in this case he is inexact with his word choice. The mayor has been duly and suitably reminded that words have meaning but apologizes to no one for bragging about Austin’s role as a launch pad for innovation." Answer: #CA So, when was the first tweet? After reaching out to Twitter’s press office (not hearing back), we followed the suggestion of KUT News reporter Nathan Bernier, who’d retweeted and questioned Adler’s claim. Bernier guided us to a 2013 book by journalist Nick Bilton covering Twitter’s birth and growth, "Hatching Twitter," which includes a chapter stating that one of the San Francisco-based company’s founders, Jack Dorsey, posted the first "official" Twitter update at 11:50 a.m. March 21, 2006. According to the book, Dorsey tweeted from the office of his then-employer, Odeo, a faltering podcast venture. Dorsey’s post said: "just setting up my twittr,’ matching the wording of a test message someone else sent earlier. Other insiders joined in, according to the book, on what was then a crude website that like a blog, presented a stream of updates. We also noticed a "Milestones" section on Twitter’s website showcasing Dorsey’s groundbreaking tweet, though with a Central time zone time-stamp: A web search led us next to a July 2006 TechCrunch story stating: "Odeo released a new service today called Twttr, which is a sort of ‘group send’ SMS application... Each person controls their own network of friends. When any of them send a text message to ‘40404,’ all of his or her friends see the message via sms. This launched officially today, and a few select insiders were playing with the service at the Valleyschwag party in San Francisco last night." So it looks like the first tweet was fired off in California. Austin's moment Still, the next milestone listed by Twitter says that in March 2007, "Twitter breaks through at SXSW Interactive, wins the digital confab’s SXSW Web Award," and that mention includes a web link to a description of the prizewinning moment: "Twitter won the SXSW Web Award tonight in the ‘Blog’ category. Of course everyone immediately Twittered that Twitter won, causing massive waves of SMS notifications throughout the ballroom." The South by Southwest conference, of course, occurs in Austin. A March 2007 San Francisco Chronicle news story called Twitter the "toast of the town" during SXSW Interactive that year. More from that story (which indicates "tweet" hadn’t yet gained currency as a noun or verb): "Large flat-panel screens at the conference had people's twitters floating by in real time. Cell phones beeped and buzzed during speeches. Groups of people stood in pockets at parties, looking down at their glowing phones and PDAs. San Francisco blogger and humorist Min Jung Kim wrote a Twitter haiku observing, "twitter defined as/turning bunches of geeks to/14 year old girls." "Twitters filled up users' cell phones and wore out their batteries. "It also gave rise to a new lingo. Among the coinages: twittermob, which, in the definition from Thor Muller of Web design firm Rubyred Labs and the forthcoming company Satisfaction, is ‘an unruly and ragtag horde of people that descend on an ill-prepared location after a provocative twitter message.’ ... "In the words of a twitter from Scott Beale, a heavy twitterer and the head of San Francisco's Laughing Squid Web hosting service, ‘I think we reached Twittercal mass in Austin. It will be interesting to see where we go from here.’" Our ruling Adler said the first tweet was sent from Austin. That’s not so. Twitter gained momentum during a SXSW conference in Austin, but the first tweet had been sent nearly a year earlier from California, where the company is based.

pomt-10933	"Trump tax cut benefits all congressional districts, up to $44,697 per family."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2018/jul/26/kevin-mccarthy/could-trump-tax-cut-save-44697-family/	As Republican lawmakers seek to gain momentum for "tax cut 2.0" -- legislation to expand the tax law signed in December by President Donald Trump -- they have returned to tax-related messaging. One tweet by a prominent House Republican latched on to a new study of the tax law’s impact. On July 23, House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., sent a tweet touting the benefits of the tax changes, which were passed exclusively with Republican support. "ZERO Democrats voted for this → ‘Trump tax cut benefits all congressional districts, up to $44,697 per family,’" McCarthy tweeted. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com The tweet links to an article about a study by the Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank, that had been released that same day. The gist of the Heritage study is that, thanks to the tax law, "in 2018, taxpayers will save an average of $1,400, and married couples with two children will save $2,917. Over the next 10 years, because of a larger economy driven by tax cuts and the tax cuts themselves, the typical American household will benefit from more than $26,000 more in take-home pay, or $44,697 for a family of four." We don’t doubt that taxpayers in every congressional district will benefit in some way from the tax law. However, McCarthy glosses over some of the study’s nuances. Let’s take a closer look. Analyzing the Heritage study The word to focus on in the Heritage study is "average." It appears 121 times in the 27-page report. By contrast, the term "median" doesn’t appear at all. Here’s why that matters. When you compute an average (specifically, the "mean") of a set of numbers, you calculate the sum of everything, then divide that by the number of items. But when you compute the median, you line up all of the items from smallest to largest, then choose the midpoint. For something like the tax bill, which has significantly different impacts on different types of taxpayers, the measurement you use can make a significant difference. As we have noted, the tax law provides a disproportionate share of its benefits to wealthier taxpayers. Lower- and middle-income taxpayers do get tax cuts under the law -- something we’ve fact-checked Democrats for downplaying -- but all told, the tax bill does skew favorably toward the wealthy. That’s not a surprise -- under the United States’ progressive tax system, richer taxpayers foot a disproportionate share of the tax bill. Still, it’s a notable feature of the law. Here’s an analysis of the size of the average tax cut for each income group, compiled by the Urban Institute-Brookings Institution Tax Policy Center. For 2018, the average tax cut for the middle 20 percent of the income scale is $780. That’s much less than it is for the top one-fifth of the income scale -- $5,790 -- and compared to the top 1 percent, at $32,650, it’s positively paltry. See Figure 2 on PolitiFact.com In Heritage’s methodology, these very large tax refunds are factored into the calculations. If a median had been used, the expansionary effect of those large amounts on the "typical" figure would have been muted. "Because of the high-dollar value of the tax cuts received by many wealthy households and the fact that there are fewer wealthy households than low-income households, the average tax cut is going to be higher than the median tax cut," said Patrick Newton, a spokesman for the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget. Tax experts said it’s not clear that Heritage could have computed a true median with the data available. But other groups have come up with other ways to weed out the impact of very large tax savings when producing a measurement of a typical tax cut. The Tax Policy Center is one of them. As we noted, the Tax Policy Center found that the average tax cut for the middle 20 percent of the population was $780. That’s a fraction of the analogous figure in the Heritage study, $1,400. Another group that made a similar assessment, the liberal-leaning Institute for Taxation and Economic Policy, found a figure in line with the Tax Policy Center -- $800 for the middle 20 percent. "Certainly only looking at the average tax change is not reflective of what the ‘median’ taxpayer will experience," said Joe Rosenberg, a senior research associate at the Tax Policy Center. Adam Michel, Heritage’s tax policy analyst, told PolitiFact that they did not calculate a median, but added that "we are not unique in using averages," citing both Congress’ Joint Committee on Taxation and the Tax Policy Center. "That said, every statistic, both median and mean, gives you different information," Michel said. He added that an alternative approach -- looking at the tax cut as a percentage of income in every congressional district, rich and poor -- shows that lower-income districts actually saw tax cuts account for a larger percentage of income than higher-income districts did. A final note: McCarthy’s use of the $44,697 figure is a bit overheated, as well. It refers to a 10-year cumulative figure, using assumptions that the tax cut boosts economic growth. So that figure is neither for a single year, nor is it guaranteed to pan out. McCarthy’s office did not respond to inquiries. Our ruling McCarthy said, "Trump tax cut benefits all congressional districts, up to $44,697 per family." The benefits McCarthy is talking about are added up over 10 years, something that is readily apparent. The number does come from a real study -- and McCarthy is careful to hedge by saying "up to" -- but he glosses over significant nuance. The actual one-year, per-household tax cut in the study he cited is $1,400, and even that is exaggerated because the study uses averages, which give greater weight to big tax cuts at the top of the income scale than a median would have. Estimates by other organizations suggest a middle-income household would save between $780 and $800 per year. We rate the statement Half True.

pomt-01339	Photos prove the Denver light rail system has low ridership.	false	/florida/statements/2014/oct/23/no-tax-tracks/greenlight-pinellas-opponents-argue-denver-light-r/	No Tax For Tracks, the grassroots group opposing the Greenlight Pinellas mass transit initiative, says it has plenty of evidence light rail isn’t worth the cost. Just look at Denver, they say. Spokesperson Barb Haselden presented a series of photos during a debate with Greenlight’s Kyle Parks at the Stetson University College of Law on Sept. 29 (starting in the video at 27:40). The images showed a nearly deserted transit station, empty rail cars and a parking lot with almost no cars. "I went to Denver for a transportation conference; they opened their light rail line 16 months ago. … When I got out and walked up to the front door to the brand new transit hub, nobody was there," she said, clicking onto an image of glass doors. "I walked in the door that you just saw, main concourse at 10:30 Friday morning, nobody was there." Empty staircases. "Ticket windows: Nobody’s there. A few people waiting on a train." Ticket windows without buyers. About a half-dozen people waiting on a platform. "I got on the train, I quickly turned to the right to take a picture, and then I turned to the left." A couple of passengers, then no passengers. "But people say, well gee, maybe this is because it’s 10:30 and they had all gone to work," she said. "Here’s the Park-n-Ride lot. Empty." No Tax For Tracks is using this as proof that Greenlight Pinellas is a boondoggle, despite the Pinellas Suncoast Transit Authority and Greenlight boosters crying foul. The whole thing made PolitiFact Florida wonder, was her presentation truly worth a few thousand fares? On the FasTracks Haselden and No Tax For Tracks didn’t return our messages, but we figured out she attended the American Dream Conference from Sept. 19-21, 2014, sponsored by the American Dream Coalition, a vocal opponent of mass transit. Speakers conducted presentations with titles like "Sustainable Suburban Development Can Defeat Social Engineering," "Stopping Wasteful Projects Through Citizen Advocacy" and "Fighting Southern Florida’s Seven-50 Plan," referring to a public-private urban planning initiative in southeast Florida. The conference started with a tour on Sept. 19, including taking a train from downtown Denver’s Union Station to Golden on the region’s newest light rail line, the West line on the project called FasTracks. The public began using it in April 2013. It’s the first light rail line in the transit expansion approved by voters in 2004. The plan instituted a new 4/10 of a percent sales tax to add six new rail lines and bus rapid transit to the four lines in service since October 1994. The project was originally projected to cost $4.7 billion, but grew to more than $6 billion. These points are highlighted in a No Tax For Tracks video from the conference in which Natalie Menten, an elected board member for the Denver area’s Regional Transportation District and outspoken opponent of government spending, calls the entire project "a failure, from start to finish." Menten says the RTD public relations department would say the project came in under budget and ahead of schedule, and that wasn’t true. So we asked the district’s PR department. That’s not quite what they told us. Fare vs. fair It should be noted that yes, the FasTracks project’s budget did increase significantly. Several things occurred to (ahem) derail initial estimates. Pauletta Tonilas, senior public relations manager for the RTD, said some engineering and environmental solutions ended up being more complex than planned. There also was a spike in construction costs, as the prices for concrete, steel, diesel fuel, copper and the like went up. The Great Recession also disrupted the project, cutting into sales tax revenue after 2008. Another snag was a recent change by the Federal Railroad Administration requiring the use of bigger, stronger light rail cars on lines that moved along freight corridors, Tonilas said. With some creative financing and planning, the RTD finished the first phase, the 12-mile West line, eight months ahead of the working schedule. The West line averages about 14,000 trips per day -- that is, one person buying a ticket -- and should grow when other FasTracks lines open in 2016, Tonilas said. That accounts for about 17 percent of the 84,000 or so trips she said the entire light rail system gets per day, although that varies from month to month. The whole RTD system, including bus, rail and shuttle service, averages about 350,000 trips per day. To put that in perspective, Denver’s light rail consistently ranks in the top 10 light rail systems in the country, in terms of ridership. San Francisco’s streetcars get some 220,000 trips per day and Charlotte gets about 16,000, according to the American Public Transportation Association. Tampa’s streetcar line nets somewhere around 700 trips per day. Current projections for the 24-mile Greenlight Pinellas light rail line from St. Petersburg to Clearwater scheduled to open in 2024 estimate it will cost $1.87 billion to build, with about 17,000 riders per day by 2035. Back to the negatives Now, let’s get back to Haselden’s presentation, because there are some holes in it. First, the empty concourse. Scott Reed, assistant general manager for RTD communications, told us that was not a light rail station. It’s the renovated Union Station bus concourse, an underground station with light rail platforms above it. It’s still pretty empty, but that’s because ridership generally follows normal commuting times, Reed said. It’s no surprise the bus concourse and rail platforms were relatively empty at 10:30 on a Friday morning. Also, this was a westbound train headed to the suburbs in the morning, the opposite of normal commuting patterns. Haselden said no one was at the Park-n-Ride lot, but there’s a good reason for that, too: That was a parking lot for the Pepsi Center, the arena where the city’s professional hockey and basketball teams play, Reed said. It wouldn’t normally be filled on a Friday morning. Union Station doesn’t have a Park-n-Ride lot, Reed said, because it’s downtown. On at least one occasion, during an interview with Fox 13, Haselden was told the parking lot belonged to the arena, and the station said she had apologized. Our ruling No Tax For Tracks gave a presentation with photos they said prove the Denver light rail system has low ridership. After examining the presentation and Denver’s light rail system, we found the opposite. Not only are the photos misrepresenting the city’s mass transit, but statistics show the Mile High city has one of the more successful systems in the country. No Tax For Tracks may not approve of how rail is funded or operated, but using photos of one thing and saying it’s another nullifies the argument. We rate the statement False. Correction, Oct. 24, 2014: The story has been changed to reflect the Tampa streetcar line averages about 700 trips per day. The story previously had a different number.

pomt-11330	Says Buzz Aldrin "passes UFO lie detector test leaving experts convinced that he encountered alien life."	pants on fire!	/punditfact/statements/2018/apr/10/blog-posting/no-buzz-aldrin-didnt-see-space-aliens-and-take-lie/	Buzz Aldrin, the 88-year-old astronaut who became the second man to walk on the Moon in 1969, made the news in recent days -- but not of his own volition. A story about Aldrin witnessing space aliens went viral. The headline on hidden-mag.com’s post was, "Buzz Aldrin ‘passes UFO lie detector test leaving experts convinced that he encountered alien life.’" The post went on to say that Aldrin and other astronauts -- Al Worden, Edgar Mitchell and Gordon Cooper -- "gave accounts of their sightings under strict lab conditions." Specifically, the post said, the four "took part in the study conducted by the Institute of BioAcoustic Biology in Albany, Ohio." One problem with the story: Cooper died in 2004, while Mitchell died in 2016. Worden is 86. Another problem with the post: It said that Aldrin had said "he was a spaceship on his way to the Moon," the post said, when he saw "something out there that was close enough to be observed … sort of L-shaped." According to the post, Aldrin passed a test akin to a lie detector, only "more reliable." That’s an incomplete and misleading snippet from a Reddit Ask Me Anything session he took part in three years ago. Here’s the full comment. "On Apollo 11 (en) route to the Moon, I observed a light out the window that appeared to be moving alongside us. There were many explanations of what that could be, other than another spacecraft from another country or another world -- it was either the rocket we had separated from, or the 4 panels that moved away when we extracted the lander from the rocket and we were nose to nose with the two spacecraft. So in the close vicinity, moving away, were 4 panels. And i feel absolutely convinced that we were looking at the sun reflected off of one of these panels. Which one? I don't know. So technically, the definition could be ‘unidentified.’ "We well understood exactly what that was. And when we returned, we debriefed and explained exactly what we had observed. And I felt that this had been distributed to the outside world, the outside audience, and apparently it wasn't, and so many years later, I had the time in an interview to disclose these observations, on another country's television network. And the UFO people in the United States were very very angry with me, that I had not given them the information. It was not an alien. Extraordinary observations require extraordinary evidence. That's what Carl Sagan said. There may be aliens in our Milky Way galaxy, and there are billions of other galaxies. The probability is almost CERTAIN that there is life somewhere in space. It was not that remarkable, that special, that unusual, that life here on earth evolved gradually, slowly, to where we are today. "But the distances involved in where some evidence of life may be, they may be hundreds of light years away." Bottom line: In the Reddit session, Aldrin clearly rejected any suggestion that the light he saw was some sort of of space alien. A representative for Aldrin told PolitiFact that the lie-detector angle is bogus as well. "We don’t know where this new UFO story came from," said Christina Korp, vice president of marketing, media and business development for Aldrin. "Buzz did not take a lie detector test. He has never said he saw a UFO." Referring to the light he mentioned in the Reddit session, Korp said, "Buzz has been very clear on this over the years and has never wavered in his description of it. He does not believe in UFOs. ... This is not the first time someone has tried to capitalize on using Buzz’s name to make headlines." The Aldrin story appears to have originated with an April 8 "exclusive" article in the Daily Star, a site based in the United Kingdom. Our ruling Various websites ran articles with headlines claiming that Buzz Aldrin passed a lie detector test claiming he "encountered alien life." However, a spokeswoman for Aldrin said the retired astronaut never took any type of "lie-detector" test. Meanwhile, Aldrin was clear in the Reddit session three years ago that he felt an unusual light he saw during space flight had prosaic origins and was not an alien. We rate this Pants on Fire.

pomt-10265	While in the Illinois Senate, Barack Obama passed legislation moving people "from welfare to jobs."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/aug/25/michelle-obama/obama-sponsored-state-level-welfare-law/	Michelle Obama spoke at the Democratic National Convention in Denver on Aug. 25, 2008, dwelling largely on a personal portrait of her home life with Barack Obama and her upbringing in a working-class family on Chicago's South Side. She concluded her speech with a call to civic duty. "I believe that each of us — no matter what our age or background or walk of life — each of us has something to contribute to the life of this nation. It's a belief Barack shares — a belief at the heart of his life's work. ... "It's what he did in the Illinois Senate, moving people from welfare to jobs, passing tax cuts for hard- working families, and making sure women get equal pay for equal work." Here, we'll look at a claim we checked previously , that Obama moved people from welfare to work. The claim goes back to his days as a state senator in the Illinois legislature. President Bill Clinton and Congress significantly overhauled welfare in 1996, requiring recipients to work and setting time limits on benefits. The states in turn had to change their laws to meet the new federal requirements. In 1997, Obama signed up as a chief co-sponsor (one of five in the Senate) on Illinois' version of the legislation. But the Illinois governor at the time, Republican Jim Edgar, got a lot of credit as well. Press reports from the time referred to the plan as "the Edgar plan." This isn't the first time Obama has referred to Illinois laws as if he passed them singlehandedly . Also, in floor remarks from the time, Obama expressed less than full support for the federal legislation. He was particularly concerned that people removed from welfare would be able to receive training so they could earn a living wage. "I am not a defender of the status quo with respect to welfare," Obama said on the Illinois Senate floor. "Having said that, I probably would not have supported the federal legislation, because I think it had some problems. But I'm a strong believer in making lemonade out of lemons. ... I think this is a good start, and I urge support of this bill." Nevertheless, the legislation's primary role was welfare reform, and the legislative record shows that Obama had a leadership role in getting it passed. For these reasons, we find Obama's claim Mostly True.	None	Michelle Obama	None	None	None	2008-08-25T00:00:00	2008-08-25	['Barack_Obama', 'Illinois']

pomt-12981	"Pence: ‘Michelle Obama Is The Most Vulgar First Lady We’ve Ever Had’"	pants on fire!	/punditfact/statements/2016/dec/20/politiconocom/satirical-site-made-story-mike-pence-called-michel/	Vice President-elect Mike Pence attacked First Lady Michelle Obama as the most distasteful woman to ever live in the White House — at least according to a fake news story on a website that bills itself as satirical. A headline on an Oct. 14, 2016, story on Politicono.com declared "Pence: ‘Michelle Obama Is The Most Vulgar First Lady We’ve Ever Had’." Users flagged the suspicious post as part of Facebook’s attempt to stop the spread of fake news. The story was pegged to a real instance of Pence defending Donald Trump, who was then the GOP presidential candidate running against Hillary Clinton. Michelle Obama had said in a speech on Oct. 13, without mentioning Trump by name, that a 2005 recording had shown the GOP nominee admitting to "sexually predatory behavior." Pence appeared on CBS This Morning on Oct. 14 and sounded puzzled by Michelle Obama’s comments. "Look I have a lot of respect for the first lady," he said. "But I don’t understand the basis of her claim." But that’s about as far as Pence’s comments went. He never called Obama vulgar, and certainly not the most vulgar first lady ever. That’s because Politicono.com is a website (its slogan is "Just Enough News") that takes a kernel of real news and sprouts an entire fabricated story around it. It says readers come to the site to read "a unique brand of entertainment and information that is enhanced by features like our fact-button, which allows readers to find what is fact and what is satire." Indeed, at the top of the Pence story are two buttons: "Show facts" and "hide facts." Clicking the "show facts" button highlights only the first paragraph of the story. The rest is entirely made up. Politicono.com didn’t respond to our requests for comment, but when we talked to them for another fact-check in 2015, an administrator pointed out they admit some content is exaggerated. That makes the website less culpable than many others that give no indication something may be contrived, but it’s still not immediately apparent the story is fake. It’s also very misleading to build upon a real event and then purposely obscuring which part is true and which is not. The comments section on the story itself certainly shows many have been fooled. Either way, Pence did not call the first lady vulgar.

pomt-07812	"For the last decade, funding in the health and human services budget has grown at twice the rate as other parts of the budget, and I think that context is important."	mostly true	/florida/statements/2011/feb/17/joe-negron/state-sen-joe-negron-says-human-services-spending/	The call for cuts to state spending has started in earnest in Tallahassee where lawmakers are beginning the process of formulating Florida's upcoming budget. They are doing so amid projections of a $3.62 billion financial shortfall. One cost-cutting plan, pitched by Sen. Joe Negron, a Stuart Republican who chairs the Senate Health and Human Services Appropriations Committee, calls for trimming $1.5 billion in health care spending by privatizing Medicaid and cutting certain benefits. "My goal is the benefits under Medicaid will not be worse than what any private citizen has, but not better, either," Negron told the Palm Beach Post on Feb. 14, 2011. Negron also spoke about his plan to rein in health care spending at a Feb. 15 hearing of his committee. "For the last decade, funding in the health and human services budget has grown at twice the rate as other parts of the budget, and I think that context is important," Negron told the committee, as reported by the Orlando Sentinel. We decided to evaluate Negron's claim concerning the rate of growth for program spending. When we asked the senator how he arrived at his statement, he provided us with this spreadsheet that gave the amount appropriated for human services for the 2001-2002 budget compared to the amount appropriated in the 2010-2011 budget. He also provided spending figures for all other program areas in those two years. To clarify, health and human services is not a single department in Florida. Rather, it's a section of the budget that provides funding for state agencies like the Department of Health, Department of Children and Families, Elder Affairs, Veterans Affairs and the Agency for Health Care Administration. Negron's figures show $16.9 billion was appropriated for spending in the 2001-02 budget, which 10 years later increased to $28.5 billion. That's an increase of 68 percent. He did the same calculation for all other state-funded programs, showing a change from $31.2 billion in 2001-02 to $41.8 billion a decade later. Those figures amount to a 34 percent increase. "The extraordinary growth in Medicaid has limited the ability to fund other equally worthy budget areas such as education," Negron said in a phone interview on Feb. 15. By taking a financial snapshot of the budgets approved in 2001 and 2010, Negron's figures do demonstrate that the change in the human services budget is twice the change in the rest of the budget. But is it fair to compare just the first and last years of the decade, which shows the change but not the rate of growth? After all, parts of the budget went up and down at different times and different rates during those years. The Governor's Office of Policy and Budget pointed us to 10 years of budgets. To evaluate the rate of growth, we computed the compound annual growth rates over the decade. The compound annual growth rate is what financial analysts call a "smoother." It would be the growth rate if the budget grew at a steady rate for 10 years, and it's a common way to compare the rate of change over time. We'd explain how to calculate it, but it involves exponents. This is a good explanation, if you want to see the details. A number of free CAGR calculators are available on the internet, and you can try them here, here or here. You can see our math here. In a CAGR comparison, the rates are a little different. The budget for human services grew at a compound annual growth rate of 5.3 percent over 10 years, and the rest of the budget grew at 3.04 percent. That's still considerably higher growth for human services, by about 75 percent, but not twice as much. Negron was looking back at the past decade, but we also reviewed Gov. Rick Scott's proposed budget for the next two years. The budget cuts are about $5 billion the first year, 2011-12, and another $2.6 billion the following year. And Scott proposes to keep human services spending at almost the same level as this year. So if Negron had included the budget forecast in his statement, it would have easily been true no matter which method we used for comparison. But Negron's comment was that "for the last decade, funding in the health and human services budget has grown at twice the rate as other parts of the budget." From the start of the decade to the end, the increase in the human services budget is double the rest of the budget, but the growth rate is not quite doubled. We rate this claim Mostly True.

pomt-13404	"Welcome to #Houston, the most #diverse city in #America."	mostly true	/texas/statements/2016/sep/23/sylvester-turner/sylvester-turner-calls-houston-nations-most-divers/	Houston Mayor Sylvester Turner unveiled 60 welcome signs destined for the city’s airports, libraries and convention center via a tweet saluting the city’s diversity. "Welcome to #Houston, the most #diverse city in #America. New posters up at City Hall and the airports," Turner said in July 2016. The Bayou City is known for a few things. Its size as the nation’s fourth-most populous city, for one. The constant one-two punch of heat and humidity for much of the year could be another. And the city’s diversity comes to mind. Still, with other U.S. cities having similar reputations, we wondered how Turner determined Houston ranks No. 1. Turner cites Kinder Institute study By email, Janice Evans in the mayor’s office told us Turner relied on a 2012 report from the Kinder Institute for Urban Research, a Rice University think tank, stating that based on the 2010 U.S. Census, the Houston metropolitan area--taking in Harris and adjoining Fort Bend, Montgomery, Brazoria, and Galveston counties--was the most racially and ethnically diverse of the country’s top 10 most populous metropolitan areas. The report, we found, relied on a statistical calculation known as an Entropy Index which a 2004 U.S. Census Bureau paper calls a measure of "evenness," in this instance how ethnic groups are distributed across Houston-area neighborhoods. The index, devised by Dutch econometrician Henri Theil and others in the early 1970s, compares the population of individual groups to the general population. Kinder’s analysis counted the population of four major ethnic groups (white, black, Latino and Asian) and calculated how close the total population was to having balanced percentages across the groups. In the end, Houston had an entropy score of 0.874, narrowly edging New York, which had a 0.872 score. "All but two of the 10 largest metropolitan areas, Boston and Philadelphia, have a higher entropy score than the national average of 0.709," the report said, "meaning that in general the large metropolitan areas are more diverse than the nation as a whole." Metro Areas Entropy Index Scores Houston-Sugar Land-Baytown, TX 0.874 New York-Northern New Jersey-Long Island NY-NJ-PA 0.873 Washington-Arlington-Alexandria, DC-VA-MD-WV 0.859 Los Angeles-Long Beach-Santa Ana, CA 0.855 Dallas-Fort Worth-Arlington, TX 0.822 Miami-Fort Lauderdale-Pompano Beach, FL 0.820 Chicago-Joliet-Naperville, IL-IN-WI 0.806 Atlanta-Sandy Springs-Marietta, GA 0.786 Philadelphia-Camden-Wilmington, PA-NJ-DE-MD 0.686 Boston-Cambridge-Quincy, MA-NH 0.570 SOURCE: Report, Houston Region Grows More Racially/Ethnically Diverse, With Small Declines in Segregation, Kinder Institute for Urban Research, 2012 The Houston metro area stood out, the report said, because "unlike the other large metropolitan areas, all four major racial/ethnic groups have substantial representation in Houston with Latinos and Anglos occupying roughly equal shares of the population." City versus region? But when talking about diverse cities, it’s worth mentioning that neither diversity nor "city" has a consistent definition. John Logan, a Brown University sociologist whose research we spotted online, explained by email that researchers often prefer to look at metro area populations rather than limiting their focus to residents within city limits, since in many urban areas people live beyond the city limits. Jack Fong, a sociologist at the California State Polytechnic University, Pomona, told us that historically, the definition of any city or metropolitan area has proved fluid, even ambiguous, with no exact consensus among experts. We reached out to Fong after he was cited as an expert in a May 2016 diversity study on the online financial planning website WalletHub. That study pegged Houston as the 23rd most diverse city in the nation--though 10th among cities with a population exceeding 300,000. Fong said that often in diversity studies, researchers decide on the physical boundaries first and then derive data on the population within those boundaries, instead of surveying people to see how they self-identify. He said people connect to a city very much based on emotion, and "don’t care what the map says." In an urban sociology textbook, Fong noted the many ways a city has been defined, across regions and throughout history, "given that almost 200 countries on the planet have different approaches toward identifying the boundaries of their urban areas." Both the WalletHub analysis and a May 2015 article posted by FiveThirtyEight focused on cities rather than metropolitan areas. The FiveThirtyEight study went this route because cities matter "especially for questions of urban planning and city-administered services like schooling and policing," the story read. Houston comparatively looks less diverse, we determined, if you look at cities by themselves, not sweeping in adjoining areas. The Kinder Institute report also found two suburbs of Houston, Pearland and Missouri City, were more diverse than Houston itself. "There’s no perfection, no precision, no exactness in how diversity can be measured," Fong said. The lack of one singular definition of what a city or metro area is, along with analyzing the population based on different categories, will lead to varying outcomes. When local leaders tout their city’s diversity, however, Fong would recommend following up to find out how they reached those conclusions. Other research Web searches and interviews helped us identify other studies, not all of them placing Houston first in diversity. For instance, a clickable analysis by the Institute for Child, Youth and Family Policy at Brandeis University makes it possible to gauge the diversity of metro area populations based on a variety of factors for the years 2000, 2010 and 2012. Among options: The data can be analyzed to look at only the population under 18 years of age, or over 65 years old, or to compare native-born and foreign-born residents. Houston ranked 11th for its 18 and under population and 97th for its 65 and older population among the 100 largest metro areas, and sixth nationally for its foreign-born and 39th for its native-born populations. Another resource, the US2010 Project from Brown University and Penn State University, allowed us to gauge the "diversity index" of the nation’s major metro areas for 1980, 1990, 2000 and 2010. By this analysis, the greater Houston area in 2010 landed eighth nationally, trailing areas including San Francisco, Washington, D.C., New York and Las Vegas. It looked to us like Houston didn’t rank first because the project took into account five racial ethnic categories, the additional one being other, which mainly accounts for the Native American population; Kinder considered four. Bingo, Logan told us by email, further noting that when people identified as more than one race, they were not counted in both categories but instead assigned to one in the US2010 rankings. "These choices naturally have some impact on the diversity measure," Logan said. We shared our diverse findings with Turner’s office. In reply, spokeswoman Janice Evans pointed out by phone that however Houston ranks, it’s "very diverse. Anyone who lives here knows that." Our ruling Turner tweeted that Houston is the most diverse city in the country. While the Kinder Institute report lists Houston as the most diverse out of the country’s biggest metropolitan areas, other metro area rankings, such as the US2010 Project, place it high but not at the very top. Rankings that compare only cities rank Houston lower nationally. Experts acknowledge diversity can be calculated in a multitude of ways, which makes it difficult to come to one singular conclusion.

pomt-05575	"More children die in agricultural jobs than in any other industry."	true	/georgia/statements/2012/apr/04/rashad-taylor/federal-stats-back-labor-deaths-claim/	Most nonbinding resolutions that come before the Georgia House of Representatives garner little debate, but one involving child labor laws got a little testy. Some House members were angry about a U.S. Department of Labor proposal they say would make it tougher for children to work on the family farm. Agriculture is Georgia’s largest industry. So Georgia lawmakers wrote House Resolution 1561, which said the federal agency "seeks to impose harsh, extreme, and uncalled for regulations attempting to ban students from working on farms." Not so, said Rep. Rashad Taylor, an Atlanta Democrat who opposed the resolution. Taylor said he’s worried about the safety of children working on some farms. He offered several amendments to the resolution, claiming portions of it were incorrect. Taylor’s argument included a claim that some lawmakers quickly disputed. "More children die in agricultural jobs than in any other industry," he said. One lawmaker suggested more children die playing football than from agricultural work. Another suggested the numbers may be higher because more children work in agriculture than other industries. Rep. Penny Houston, a Republican from South Georgia, asked Taylor several pointed questions that suggested she didn’t think the lawmaker from the big city understood the issue. Her questions included a query wondering if Taylor had ever picked peas. We dug deep on Taylor’s claim. Currently, minors may be employed by their parents at any time in any occupation on a farm owned or operated by his or her parents. Unfortunately, there’s not much research on child labor deaths. The most recent data came to us from a department within the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. They put together a spreadsheet using Bureau of Labor Statistics data to determine the number of children 18 and under who died on the job between 2003 and 2010. During that time, there were 311 deaths nationwide. Nearly half of those deaths, 151, were in the agriculture industry, the data showed. A CDC spokeswoman told PolitiFact Georgia that 73 percent of all work-related deaths for children 15 and under were in the agriculture, forestry and fishing industries. They did not have a more specific breakdown for all industries. A 2006 study by two CDC researchers reached similar conclusions. The study was based on two sets of data from 1992 to 2002. In that report, they noted research that found an astounding 79 percent of all work-related deaths for youths 10 years of age and younger occurred in agriculture production. "As a proportion of all young workers, young workers in agriculture production incur a disproportionate share of fatalities," the 2006 report says. The National Consumers League puts out an annual list of the most dangerous occupations for teenagers. In 2011, the most dangerous industry for young people 18 and younger was agriculture, with a death rate of 21.3 per 100,000 full-time employees, according to the report. Another report we saw, using BLS data, showed between 1992 and 1998 that nearly 43 percent of work-related fatalities for children 18 and younger were due to agricultural work. The second-highest percentage of fatalities was in retail trade. So why are a high proportion of children losing their lives in agriculture industries? One report found the most common cause of death of youths in agriculture is from farm machinery, such as a harvester or tractor. Between 1992 and 1997, 51 deaths of youths in agriculture nationwide could be specifically attributed to overturned tractors. Other research shows a high number of falls from moving vehicles or mobile equipment and being struck by the same. There are few reports on this subject, and there are very few deaths to study. But everything we’ve seen shows a high percentage of work-related deaths among children occur in agriculture. The most recent data shows it is nearly 50 percent. The numbers seem to back up Taylor’s claim. For the record, Taylor’s efforts to amend the resolution failed. The resolution passed. Maybe PolitiFact’s ruling will give Taylor some solace. Maybe not. We rate his claim True. Update The following section was inadvertently edited out of the print version of Tuesday’s PolitiFact Georgia regarding a statement by state Rep. Stacey Abrams on Georgia’s per-capita spending: (This item will not evaluate Abrams’ moose claim, though we warn her that she may receive calls from irate fans of South Dakota elk.

pomt-08279	Says Washington's reach extends to "even telling us what kind of light bulb we can use."	mostly false	/texas/statements/2010/nov/08/rick-perry/rick-perry-says-washingtons-reach-extends-telling-/	No duh, Gov. Rick Perry has a thing against things from Washington. His new book, "Fed Up! Our Fight to Save America from Washington," brims with what-the-hey statements about whassup in our nation's capital including a declaration that lit us up. Saying there's "no end to the reach of Washington," Perry writes that Washington is "even telling us what kind of light bulb we can use." We asked Perry for backup on that claim and didn't hear back. Then we launched a search for "use-this-bulb" regulations. What we found: In 2007, Congress voted to improve the efficiency of light bulbs. President George W. Bush signed into law the Energy Independence and Security Act, which set energy efficiency standards for kinds of incandescent lamps (light bulbs), incandescent reflector lamps (like track lighting in your kitchen), and fluorescent lamps, according to a December 2007 summary by the Congressional Research Service. With a few exceptions, the law also prohibits the U.S Coast Guard from purchasing incandescent light bulbs for use in Coast Guard office buildings. Barack Obama, Bush's successor, promised while running for president to to sign a measure into law that "begins to phase out all incandescent light bulbs." He said the change would save Americans $6 billion a year on their electric bills. Last year, PolitiFact reported that no such proposal was made it into law, though in June 2009 Obama announced changes in lighting standards. Starting in August 2012, fluorescent tube lamps (most commonly found in offices and stores) and conventional incandescent reflector lamps must become more efficient. The government said such fluorescent and incandescent lamps represented approximately 38 percent and 7 percent, respectively, of total lighting energy use. Our search for instances of the government directing which bulbs residents can use unearthed a June 2010 editorial in the Washington Times objecting to Federal Trade Commission-issued regulations of light-bulb labels. The editorial says the regs were ordered by Congress as part of its 2007 decision to force the more efficient, curlicue-shaped compact fluorescent light bulb "on a public that so far has refused to embrace it willingly. Beginning Jan. 1, 2012, the editorial says, bureaucratic rules will phase in, and" conventional 100-watt bulbs "will be first on the contraband list." Make sense? Jen Stutsman, spokeswoman for the U.S. Department of Energy, told us that conventional incandescent bulbs are not expected to meet the efficiency standards Congress set, though the government expects manufacturers to improve incandescent technologies to meet the higher standards or consumers will move to compact fluorescent light bulbs, LED technologies or halogens. She said new standards for 100-watt bulbs take effect in January 2012. New standards for 75-watt bulbs start in 2013 and standards for 60- and 40-watt bulbs start in 2014. Stutsman said the expected shifts aren't equivalent to the government telling Americans which light bulbs to use. "Under no circumstances does it say that a consumer must purchase a specific type of light bulb," Stutsman said. Finally, we sought advice from the Dallas-based American Lighting Association, a trade group whose director of engineering and technology, Terry McGowan, said in an e-mail that it's a stretch to say federal laws are telling us what light bulb to buy. "Federal law is requiring that household light bulbs be made more efficient in steps over time as a nationwide energy-saving measure. It's like saying that new cars will have to deliver more miles/gallon. Maybe some people would say that's mandating what kind of car to buy; but that's an interpretation — especially if many cars on the market can meet the miles/gallon requirement," McGowan said. "There will still be household light bulbs available," McGowan's e-mail says, noting later that special-purpose bulbs used in appliances or for decorative purposes are exempted. "One thing is for sure; what we use for lighting our homes will take some thought — and maybe we'll be changing what we decide to do." So, is Washington telling us what kind of bulb to use? Not yet, though the 2007 law steps up efficiency requirements and that's expected to result in consumers purchasing and using different bulbs. These factors give Perry's statement an element of truth. We rate it Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.	None	Rick Perry	None	None	None	2010-11-08T06:00:00	2010-11-02	['None']
pomt-02270	Says the Koch brothers "funded the fight to let flood insurance premiums soar ... Now they’re spending millions to buy a Senate seat for Bill Cassidy so he can fight for them."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2014/apr/08/senate-majority-pac/democratic-group-assails-koch-brothers-role-louisi/	Charles and David Koch, the deep-pocketed, libertarian industrialists, seem to be all over the airwaves these days. If it’s not campaign ads being run by such Koch-supported affiliates as Americans for Prosperity, then it’s ads run by Democrats attacking candidates favored by the Koch brothers. One ad from a pro-Democratic group, the Senate Majority PAC, attacks Rep. Bill Cassidy, R-La., who is challenging incumbent Democratic Sen. Mary Landrieu in 2014. The ad features images of storm devastation -- a hot-button issue for Louisiana residents, who faced several deadly hurricanes in the past decade. Here’s the narration: "We’ve been battered by hurricanes, lost everything to floods. And for thousands of Louisianans, flood insurance and hurricane relief are our only protection. But the out-of-state billionaire Koch brothers funded the fight to let flood insurance premiums soar, helping the insurance companies and cut off hurricane relief for Louisiana families. Now they’re spending millions to buy a Senate seat for Bill Cassidy so he can fight for them. If the Kochs and Cassidy win, Louisiana loses." That’s a lot of information to weigh on the Truth-O-Meter, so we decided to zero in on this claim -- that the Koch brothers "funded the fight to let flood insurance premiums soar" and "now they’re spending millions to buy a Senate seat for Bill Cassidy so he can fight for them." We’ll start by offering a hat-tip to the Washington Post Fact Checker, who gave this ad Four Pinocchios, saying that "individual lines may be true, but the net effect is highly misleading." Did the Koch brothers fund "the fight to let flood insurance premiums soar"? While the money flowing in and out of such groups as Americans for Prosperity is hard to pin down, it’s pretty clear that the group took a strong stance in a congressional debate over flood insurance. Here’s the background. The Biggert-Waters Flood Insurance Act of 2012 overhauled the National Flood Insurance Program, a federal program that provides insurance in a market -- flood insurance -- that has been historically neglected. The 2012 bill sought to bring risk and premiums into closer balance, so that flood insurance would become less of a drain on the federal treasury. It did this in part by phasing out subsidies to a portion of policyholders, at least until a policy lapses or a property is sold. For some policyholders, this meant premium rises -- a problem particularly acute in states with heavily populated coastlines. After it was passed and the size of the increases became clearer, lawmakers in these states -- including Louisiana -- felt pressure from constituents to modify the Biggert-Waters law. So lawmakers put together legislation that capped annual individual property rate increases at 18 percent, restored a grandfather rule, and refunded some premiums already paid. On March 21, 2014, President Barack Obama signed the Homeowner Flood Insurance Affordability Act into law. So how do the Koch brothers fit into this? Their affiliate, Americans for Prosperity, joined a wide range of other conservative groups in signing a letter opposing some of the proposed changes to Biggert-Waters. "Americans for Prosperity is proud to join a coalition urging Congress not to pass the Homeowners Flood Insurance Affordability Act," the group said in a post on its website. "The bill delays many of the critical reforms of the Biggert-Waters Flood Insurance Reform Act of 2012 that puts the National Flood Insurance Program in a better position going forward." The joint letter signed by AFP said the proposed legislation permitted the return of "subsidies that distort the market, belie the foundation of the NFIP, and expose taxpayers to further debt. Conservative organizations should oppose this legislation and educate and activate their supporters in opposition." Levi Russell, director of public affairs with Americans for Prosperity, disputes the notion that opposition to the legislation means allowing "flood insurance premiums to soar," saying the group supported an alternative proposed by Sen. Pat Toomey, R-Pa., that would have offered Louisiana policyholders some relief. But that was earlier in the process. The Toomey proposal was dead by the time the group signed the letter cited above, and it only talks about blocking the proposed overhaul, not presenting an alternative. Ultimately, a prominent advocacy groups funded by the Koch brothers, AFP, took a strong stance against House legislation to curb premium increases for flood-insurance policyholders. Are the Koch brothers "spending millions to buy a Senate seat for Bill Cassidy so he can fight for them"? AFP has run a number of ads against Landrieu, including this one, this one, this one, this one, and this one. It’s worth noting some legal caveats. Americans for Prosperity is a 501(c)(4) group, meaning that it can advocate for political issues but cannot urge votes for or against a specific candidate. This is why its ads typically urge viewers to "tell" Landrieu that they oppose this issue or that or to call her office, rather than suggesting they vote for her opponent. In addition, the group’s legal status means that it cannot coordinate with the Cassidy campaign (or with the campaign of any other Landrieu opponent). So even if it’s true that the Koch brothers want to "buy" a Senate seat for Cassidy, it’s not the kind of support Cassidy can actively court. Still, Cassidy hasn’t exactly renounced them, either. The Baton Rouge Advocate reported that in January, Cassidy and AFP held events at the same restaurant in Covington, La., within 30 minutes of each other, and that between the events, Cassidy told someone from AFP, "Thank y’all for the ads you’re running. Obviously, you care deeply about our country, and Obamacare is a bad thing." So, viewed in isolation, both of these claims contain a lot of truth. Case closed? Not so fast. There’s a gaping omission in the Senate Majority PAC ad that undercuts the suggestion that Cassidy is simply a puppet of the Kochs. What’s missing? The Senate Majority PAC ad ignores that the bill so strongly opposed by AFP and other conservative groups was, to a large degree, shepherded by none other than Rep. Bill Cassidy. In fact, the measure was officially known as the "Grimm-Cassidy substitute amendment." The "Grimm" in the bill’s name -- Rep. Michael Grimm, R-N.Y. -- wrote a letter to the New Orleans Times-Picayune touting Cassidy’s role. "I am extremely grateful to Dr. Cassidy for being such a dedicated partner in our efforts to protect homeowners throughout the country," Grimm wrote. "Without his contributions, the House's ability to forestall the catastrophic effects of Biggert-Waters and pass a far-reaching relief bill for the hard-working folks from the Big Apple to the Big Easy may never have been realized at all." Cassidy provided an exhaustive timeline of his involvement in the flood-insurance legislation in a news release here. So, in the case of flood insurance, Cassidy was working hard to enact the proposal that Koch-affliliated groups opposed. Our ruling The Senate Majority PAC ad said the Koch brothers "funded the fight to let flood insurance premiums soar ... Now they’re spending millions to buy a Senate seat for Bill Cassidy so he can fight for them." Two major Koch-funded groups opposed the legislative rewrite of the flood-insurance law, and AFP has been airing a lot of ads attacking Cassidy’s opponent. But the ad’s message is significantly undermined by its suggestion that Cassidy is a puppet of the Kochs, particularly on flood insurance. The reality is that Cassidy sided with constituents and against the AFP position on flood insurance as recently as last month. The statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression. We rate it Mostly False. Correction: The initial version of this story incorrectly stated that FreedomWorks receives funding from the Koch brothers. While FreedomWorks and Americans for Prosperity were both split off from Citizens for a Sound Economy, a now-defunct group founded and funded in part by the Koch brothers, there is no evidence that FreedomWorks receives any Koch brothers funding today. This change does not affect our ruling of Mostly False.	None	Senate Majority PAC	None	None	None	2014-04-08T17:19:56	2014-03-26	['None']
pomt-01075	On Common Core education standards	half flip	/wisconsin/statements/2015/jan/16/scott-walker/scott-walkers-shifting-position-common-core-educat/	Abruptly and unmistakably, Gov. Scott Walker stated a position on what nationally had become a contentious issue among conservatives: the Common Core education standards. His one-sentence announcement on July 17, 2014 read: "Today, I call on the members of the state Legislature to pass a bill in early January (2015) to repeal Common Core and replace it with standards set by people in Wisconsin." Previously, Walker’s position had not been so stark. Later, after his State of the State speech on Jan. 13, 2015, it became even less clear. All as Walker embarks on a second term and, increasingly, captures attention as a potential 2016 candidate for The White House. So has Walker has done any sort of flip-flop on Common Core? As we turn to our Flip-O-Meter, it’s important to note we’re not making a value judgment about changing a position. Rather, we are looking at whether Walker has been consistent in his stance, or changed it. Some argue a change in position shows inconsistent principles or lack of backbone, others see it as pragmatism or a willingness to compromise. Walker support The Common Core State Standards were in place in Wisconsin before Walker became governor in January 2011. State schools superintendent Tony Evers had adopted them for the state, without controversy, seven months earlier. (Evers has remained a strong Common Core supporter.) Common Core is a set of standards for English and math unveiled in 2010 that came out of years of discussion between private nonprofit groups and state education departments. The goal was to better prepare students for college and careers and ensure that students in different states learn the same academic concepts. The federal government has had a role in encouraging states to adopt the standards, but they are voluntary. Walker gave a nod to Common Core in his first state budget, which became law in June 2011. It directed Evers’ Department of Public Instruction to come up with a new statewide test for school children, and that test would have to "measure mastery" of the Common Core standards. Seven months later, in January 2012, a report was issued by the state Read to Lead Task Force, which was formed by Walker and Evers, and chaired by Walker. The report made recommendations on improving children’s reading. It noted Wisconsin was among the first states to adopt the Common Core standards, which it called "rigorous." And one of the recommendations was to ensure that the state’s early learning standards aligned with Common Core. In April 2013, Alan J. Borsuk, an education fellow at Marquette University, observed in a Milwaukee Journal Sentinel commentary that nearly three years after its adoption in Wisconsin, Common Core was little known outside of education circles. Walker "has been low key in his support, but nonetheless has been on board," Borsuk wrote. "Implementation is one of the things that Walker and Evers have cooperated on. There is criticism and opposition, but it has been pretty low volume." So, Walker showed tacit support for Common Core during most of his first term. Then there was change. Review, repeal Walker’s second state budget became law in June 2013. It prohibited the Department of Public Instruction from "directing school districts" to do further implementation of Common Core. But Common Core standards adopted by the state superintendent to that point remained in effect. Seven months later, in January 2014, Walker went further. In a speech at the State Education Convention, the governor said he was working on legislation to create a commission (to be chaired by Evers) to revisit the Common Core standards. Walker said they weren't high enough and were being dictated by people who weren't from Wisconsin, when they should be "driven by people in Wisconsin." Then six months after his speech -- and facing a formidable challenge from Democrat Mary Burke in his bid for re-election -- Walker issued his out-of-the-blue July 2014 news release calling for Common Core to be repealed (a stance he later reiterated). "The declaration comes after months of virtually no public debate among Wisconsin lawmakers on the standards," a Milwaukee Journal Sentinel news article reported. "Earlier this year, a proposal in the Legislature to undo them went nowhere, with Walker saying little." Borsuk, of Marquette, wrote: "The one-sentence news release issued by Walker symbolized how little this controversy has to do with serious work on specific aims for children's education and how much this is about politics and appealing to blocs of voters as the November (2014) election approaches." Stepping back As definitive as Walker’s position had seemed to become, it would shift again. On Jan. 5, 2015, the day of Walker’s inauguration for his second term, The Daily Caller published comments from Laurel Patrick, the governor’s press secretary. She spoke of repealing Common Core -- but of something less than that, as well. "As he works to continue transforming education, Gov. Walker will work with the Legislature on an education reform bill that includes accountability for all schools receiving state funds, as well as a repeal of Common Core," Patrick was quoted as saying. But she added: "The bottom line is he wants to make sure that no school district in the state is required to use the Common Core standards." That led Truth in American Education to accuse Walker of sending mixed signals. The group, which opposes Common Core, said "making ‘sure that no school district in the state is required to use the Common Core standards’ sounds nice, but that is an opt-out not a repeal ….Walker needs to stop saying he wants Common Core repealed, but then signal that he will settle for a weaker opt-out bill." A week later, in his State of the State address, Walker made no mention of repeal and seemed to be leaning toward opt-out, saying: "I call on the members of the state Legislature to pass legislation making it crystal clear that no school district in the state is required to use Common Core standards. Going forward, I want to eliminate any requirement to use Common Core." Our rating Walker hasn't explicitly advocated the Common Core education standards, but his position has varied. During most of his first term, the governor showed tacit support. By mid-2013, he was hitting the pause button on further implementation of the standards. In mid-2014, Walker called for an outright repeal. But by January 2015, he was saying only that he didn’t want school districts required to use Common Core. For a partial change of position and inconsistent statements, our rating is a Half Flip. ------ More on Scott Walker For profiles and stories on Scott Walker and 2016 presidential politics, go to the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel's Scott Walker page.

pomt-08712	Jennifer Carroll is the "first African-American Republican woman to be part of a statewide ticket in Florida."	true	/florida/statements/2010/sep/03/rick-scott/jennifer-carroll-could-make-history-if-elected-li/	Conservative outsider Rick Scott says he's making history with his pick for lieutenant governor. Scott's pick, Jacksonville-area state Rep. Jennifer Carroll, "is the first African-American Republican woman to be part of a statewide ticket in Florida," the Scott campaign said in a Sept. 2, 2010, news release. Carroll was born in Trinidad and moved to Florida in 1986, according to her state House website. Scott called her the "embodiment of the American Dream." But is she the first black Republican woman on a statewide ticket? In short, yes. The lieutenant governor's position has existed two separate times in state history. The first came from 1865-1889, the Reconstruction period following the Civil War, but the position was elected independent of the governor. In those years, the lieutenant governor served as ex-officio president of the Senate and cast tie-breaking votes. The lieutenant governor also was next in the line of succession to be governor. The post was abandoned from 1889-1968, before being revived. Since then, candidates for governor select a prospective lieutenant governor. The two then run together as joint candidates, or a ticket. That makes this year's two major tickets -- Scott and Carroll for Republicans, and Alex Sink and Rod Smith for Democrats -- just the 11th set in state history. The first modern-day lieutenant governor, Ray C. Osborne, was appointed by then-Gov. Claude Kirk following an amendment to the state Constitution. Carroll is the third Republican woman to be selected as the GOP candidate for lieutenant governor, but the first black woman. In 1978, former U.S. Sen. Paula Hawkins was a candidate for lieutenant governor on a ticket with Jack Eckerd. The two lost to Bob Graham and Wayne Mixson. Then in 2003, Toni Jennings became the first woman lieutenant governor. She was nominated by Gov. Jeb Bush to replace Frank Brogan. (Bush picked Sandra Mortham as a running mate in late 1997, but she withdrew after only two months when questions were raised about her office practices and spending as secretary of state.) We also should note that Carroll is the first black woman to be a major party nominee for lieutenant governor. Claude Kirk, the quixotic former Republican governor, attempted a comeback as a Democrat in 1978 and ran with state Rep. Mary Singleton, the first black woman elected to the Jacksonville City Council. The two lost in the primary. And she's the third major party black candidate for lieutenant governor. David Montgomery, a Republican, was the first during Reconstruction in 1876. The second was Darryl Jones, who was Democrat Jim Davis' running mate in 2006. We noticed that the Scott campaign used "African-American" to describe Carroll though she was born in Trinidad in the Caribbean. Carroll on her website describes herself as black, but she also is chair of the Republican Party of Florida African-American Leadership Council. We really don't want to get into a race debate about what constitutes African-American. Suffice to say she is the first black woman to be on the GOP ticket. In announcing his pick for lieutenant governor, Scott said Carroll "is the first African-American Republican woman to be part of a statewide ticket in Florida."

pomt-02538	"Any Floridian who has ever requested an absentee ballot henceforth gets one automatically."	false	/punditfact/statements/2014/feb/06/george-will/george-will-says-any-floridian-who-has-ever-reques/	Conservative pundit George Will lamented the waning influence of Election Day in a column about the special election to replace the late Rep. C.W. Bill Young. The race is the first federal election of the year, and both Democrats and Republicans are watching it closely as a potential sign of what will happen in other congressional races in November. The country’s infatuation with early voting will give Democrat Alex Sink a leg up over Republican David Jolly in the race that ends March 11, he argued. "Sink will benefit from the national trend allowing early voting to obliterate Election Day. Any Floridian who has ever requested an absentee ballot henceforth gets one automatically. ... "Instead of a community deliberation culminating in a shared day of decision, an election like the one here is diffuse and inferior. If Sink wins, Republicans nationally can shrug; if Jolly wins, Democrats should tremble. But no matter who wins, the district loses because it has lost Election Day." His comment about Florida’s absentee voting policies raised some eyebrows in Florida political circles, so we wanted to check it out. (PunditFact reached out to Will and his researcher via email but did not hear back.) Will’s column links to the website Long Distance Voter, which provides absentee ballot guidelines state by state. In a Q&A format, it asks whether someone can vote absentee on a permanent basis in Florida. The answer says "sort of," explaining that ballots can be requested for a specific election or in advance of a regularly scheduled election. We checked with official sources, too. Both the Florida Department of State and the Pinellas County supervisor of elections’ office directed us to the Florida Statutes, 101.62 (1)(a). It reads: The supervisor shall accept a request for an absentee ballot from an elector in person or in writing. One request shall be deemed sufficient to receive an absentee ballot for all elections through the end of the calendar year of the second ensuing regularly scheduled general election, unless the elector or the elector’s designee indicates at the time the request is made the elections for which the elector desires to receive an absentee ballot. Translation: If a voter requested an absentee ballot for the Congressional District 13 special election, he or she would automatically receive one for the 2014 and 2016 general elections (unless he or she requested it just for this election). After that, their request would be canceled unless they made another request at some point. "So it’s not indefinite, in other words," said Pinellas County elections supervisor spokeswoman Nancy Whitlock. A voter who requested a ballot for the 2012 general election would automatically get one for the 2014 special election, as it is one of the elections covered in the two-cycle window. The exception would be if they requested a ballot solely for the 2012 election. Our ruling Will’s claim that "any Floridian who has ever requested an absentee ballot henceforth gets one automatically" is not accurate. A Florida voter who requested an absentee ballot would get one automatically through the end of the calendar year of the second general election -- not "henceforth." Will used strong language to describe why Sink would have the edge, saying people get mail-in ballots in perpetuity in Florida. But that's not the way it works. We rate the claim False.

pomt-02525	Mark Warner voted for "nearly $1 trillion in new taxes and $7 trillion in new debt."	true	/virginia/statements/2014/feb/10/ed-gillespie/gillespie-says-warner-voted-new-taxes-and-more-deb/	Republican Ed Gillespie kicked off his campaign for the U.S. Senate by denouncing Democratic incumbent Mark Warner as a spendthrift. "Sen. Warner promised us fiscal responsibility, but he’s voted for nearly $1 trillion in new taxes and $7 trillion in new debt." Gillespie said in a video last month. We wondered whether Gillespie was right. Paul Logan, a spokesman for Gillespie, said his boss’s claim stems from Warner’s support of a Democratic budget plan that squeaked through the Senate last March on a 50-49 vote. The plan -- authored by by Senate Budget Committee Chairwoman Patty Murray, D-Wash. -- called for $975 billion in new revenues over 10 years to be matched by an equal amount of budget cuts. The new revenues would come from targeting tax breaks used by high earners and corporations. That accounts for the "nearly $1 trillion in new taxes," that Gillespie cited. What about the $7 trillion in new debt? Logan said that also came from Murray’s bill. The legislation contained estimates that it would expand total debt from $17.1 trillion in fiscal 2013 to $24.4 trillion in fiscal 2023. That comes to a $7.3 trillion increase. Total U.S debt is the sum of two major calculations: 1) The amount of "intergovernmental holdings", or money the government owes itself to support beneficiary programs such as Social Security; and 2) The amount of "public debt" in Treasury securities that are held by individuals, corporations, the Federal Reserve and state, local and foreign governments. Economists generally prefer to discuss the national debt in terms of the amount that is publicly held. Murray’s bill would have lifted that portion from $12.2 trillion in 2013 tor $18.2 trillion in 2023 -- a $6 trillion increase. Now, let’s turn to Warner, who’s made budget reform his signature issue since entering the Senate in 2009. He’s tried to establish a bipartisan coalition of senators who share his views that the nation’s financial problems can be solved only through a combination of tax increases and spending cuts. He’s criticized Republicans who refuse to increase taxes and Democrats who refuse to rein in entitlement programs such as Social Security and Medicare. Warner cast four major votes on budget plans last year: On March 21, he opposed a bill passed by House Republicans that would have balanced the budget in 10 years through trillions of dollars in cuts and no new taxes. The bill, which would have increased the national debt by $3 trillion at the end of the 10 years, was defeated in the Senate on a mostly partisan vote. On March 23, he supported Murray’s plan, which was rejected by the House. On Sept. 27, he supported a temporary government funding bill that passed the Senate. The House, however, insisted that the stopgap measure delay implementation of Obamacare. The resulting impasse led to a 16-day government shutdown. On Dec 18, he voted for a successful compromise budget that did not essentially alter spending, revenues or the rising arc of the national debt, projected by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office to reach a total $25.2 trillion in 2023. The public debt is projected to be $19.1 trillion in 2023. Our ruling Gillespie says Warner "voted for nearly $1 trillion in new taxes and $7 trillion in new debt." Although some economists might quibble with his debt figure, we don’t. We rate his statement True.	None	Ed Gillespie	None	None	None	2014-02-10T00:00:00	2014-01-16	['None']
pomt-07220	"No one thought we could get a bipartisan bill (Medicaid) passed. We did in the Florida Senate."	false	/florida/statements/2011/jun/03/mike-haridopolos/mike-haridopolos-claims-medicaid-reform-was-bipart/	Mike Haridopolos is eager to prove himself a worthier U.S. Senate candidate than his rivals. Contenders Adam Hasner and George LeMieux have spent the past few months out of office, but Haridopolos was spotlighted during the session as state Senate president. So why not tout his legislative victories? Haridopolos set out to do just that in an interview on Bay News 9's "Political Connections" show on May 22, 2011. Co-host and St. Petersburg Times political editor Adam Smith asked Haridopolos for his view on a plan by Rep. Paul Ryan, R-Wis., to reform Medicare, the federal health insurance program for people 65 and older. Ryan's plan, explained here in another PolitiFact fact-check, would basically shift Medicare's insurance responsibilities from the federal government to private insurance companies as a way of dramatically cutting costs, starting in 2022. Haridopolos neglected to answer if he would back the Ryan plan if he were a senator, but he commended Ryan for "having an honest discussion with the American public." Then Haridopolos steered the conversation away from the country's Medicare debate to Florida's problem with Medicaid -- and what he, as Senate president, has done about it. (Haridopolos caught heat about a week later when he tried to dodge the Medicare question again. A conservative radio host booted him off his show on May 31 for failing to say how he would vote on Ryan's plan if he were a member of the U.S. Senate. The incident prompted Haridopolos' campaign staff to say he would not vote for the plan as written.) But let's get back to Medicaid. Florida's Medicaid program insures about 3 million Floridians and eats up one-third, or about $22 billion, of the state budget. Haridopolos took on the issue "aggressively," he said, which resulted in reforms passing the House and his chamber. Gov. Rick Scott signed the bills on June 2. "No one thought we could get a bipartisan bill (Medicaid) passed," Haridopolos said. "We did in the Florida Senate because we listened to people for two years before we acted. Same thing with Medicare. We're going to take the input of the people and not have this top-down approach." A bipartisan bill passed in the Florida Senate, eh? If true, that bolsters Haridopolos' argument that he can create policy with the blessings of competing parties. Sounds easy enough to check. Let's start by reviewing what the Legislature passed. The Medicaid package moves almost all management of Florida's Medicaid program to state-approved HMOs and health care networks. It's a departure from the old system, in which the state pays doctors for procedures they perform. Among other effects, the plan requires managed care companies to share profits and allows recipients to obtain vouchers for private health insurance. The overhaul needs approval in the form of a waiver by the federal government, which pays for more than half of the state program. Republicans say it will improve care, reduce fraud and save the state money as the program's costs threaten to escalate. Now to examine the votes. First, remember the makeup of the Florida Legislature, where Republicans hold veto-proof majorities. The House numbers this session were 81-39 GOP, and the Senate was 28-12 GOP. So passage of a Republican-backed bill didn't need bipartisan votes. Florida's Medicaid reform package required the House and Senate to vote on two bills: HB 7107 and HB 7109. In the House, both passed along party lines. In Haridopolos' Senate, HB 7107 passed by 28-11, with all the "yea" votes coming from Republicans, and all the "no" votes from Democrats -- a strict party-line vote. HB 7109 passed the Senate 26-12, and the the only bipartisan moment occurred when Republican Sen. John Thrasher voted against the measure, on the side of united Democrats. But even that was short-lived, as Thrasher changed his vote to "yea" immediately after the vote, according to the vote history. So there were no traces of bipartisan votes in Medicaid reform that passed both chambers. We asked Haridopolos spokesman David Bishop to explain what Haridopolos meant by "bipartisan" Medicaid reform. Bishop pointed us to two committee votes on the Senate's version of Medicaid reform, SB 1972. This bill never reached the Senate floor, though, because it was replaced by the House bills. That said, it did earn a few Democratic votes -- three, to be exact -- in two committee stops. Here's a recap: In the Health Regulation Committee, it earned a yes from Sen. Eleanor Sobel, the Democratic vice chairwoman from Hollywood. In the Budget Committee, Sobel and former Senate President Gwen Margolis of Miami both approved. We followed up with Sobel about her two "yes" votes. Would she call the Senate's Medicaid reform bipartisan? She offered this explanation via e-mail: "The Senate Medicaid reform proposal was a work in progress during the committee process. I was hopeful that a final product would benefit Floridians, but compromises with the House of Representatives resulted in something that would hurt the poorest of Floridians. I opposed the final version of the bill and voted 'no.' " Sobel added: "The final version of the Medicaid reform bill was by no means bipartisan." We asked Sen. Nan Rich, the Senate's minority leader, for her thoughts. Before the May 6, 2011, vote, she said, Senate Democrats took a caucus position to oppose Medicaid reform. The Democrats felt the Republican-led measures would undermine the quality of care for recipients, among other concerns, she said. "I can promise you that it was not bipartisan," she said. So where does that leave our ruling? Haridopolos claims the Senate passed "bipartisan" Medicaid reform this session. But the final, official tallies in the Senate were both strict party-line votes. Democrats even agreed in their caucus that they would oppose Medicaid reform, and they remained united on that. Haridopolos' spokesman points out a couple Democrats who voted for reform in committee -- but the version of the bill they voted on never reached the Senate floor and was not the version that passed. We looked for bipartisanship but didn't find it here. We rate this claim False.	None	Mike Haridopolos	None	None	None	2011-06-03T12:08:01	2011-05-22	['None']

pomt-06437	Says his parents "came to America following Fidel Castro's takeover" of Cuba.	false	/florida/statements/2011/oct/21/marco-rubio/sen-marco-rubio-said-his-parents-came-america-foll/	U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio sold his American success story as he stumped across Florida two years ago. His parents left Havana in 1959, he told a Panhandle audience, in search of a better life. He told a Tampa Bay TV station, a Fox Business host and Sean Hannity on Fox News that his parents came from Cuba at the end of the 1950s — when dictator Fulgencio Batista fled Fidel Castro's revolution. "In 1959," he told Fox 13 and Fox Business. "In '58, '59," he told Fox News. By Oct. 21, 2011, the biography on his U.S. Senate website still declared his parents "came to America following Fidel Castro's takeover." But interviews, documents and news articles in September and October raised doubts. PolitiFact Florida wanted to know: Did Rubio's parents come to America "following Fidel Castro's takeover"? Doubt An Oct. 19, 2011, story by the St. Petersburg Times said naturalization records showed Rubio's parents, Mario and Oriales, became U.S. residents in May 1956. At that time, Castro lived in Mexico after a failed 1953 attack on army barracks in Santiago de Cuba. Cubans lived under the dictatorship of Batista, who had seized power as he ran for re-election in 1952. The nation, which enjoyed high literacy, a strong educational system — even the world's fifth-highest number of TVs per capita — found itself ruled by decree. In May 1956, the Rubio family would fly to the United States. Castro returned to mount his revolution in December. More than two years would pass before Batista fled on Jan. 1, 1959. In 2006, Rubio, the young soon-to-be speaker of the Florida House, would recount the takeover: "In January of 1959, a thug named Fidel Castro took power in Cuba, and countless Cubans were forced to flee." To many, he seemed to count his own family among them. And in 2009 and 2010, he told reporters dates that made that possible. News stories called the lawmaker, himself born in the United States in 1971, the son of "exiles from Castro's Cuba." Some used a specific date: 1959. Story shift In September 2011, Rubio chatted with Miami Herald reporter Marc Caputo for a story about his upcoming autobiography. They talked about Rubio's parents' immigration from Cuba. Caputo, later recounting his notes, said Rubio "struggled to recall the year ... and said it was in ' '57 or '58 or '59.' " "When asked pointedly: Was it before the revolution? Rubio said it was before the revolution," Caputo wrote in an Oct. 20 blog post. Caputo included the detail in his September story, saying Rubio was, "the son of Cuban immigrants who left Cuba just before the 1959 revolution." When we searched for news references to Rubio's parents, we found the new account differed from dozens of articles about Rubio's past, his own TV interviews, and his official campaign and Senate bios. And Rubio's bio didn't change. After the Times and the Washington Post wrote about the discrepancy, Rubio released a statement. "The dates I have given regarding my family’s history have always been based on my parents’ recollections of events that occurred over 55 years ago and which were relayed to me by them more than two decades after they happened," he wrote on Oct. 20. "I was not made aware of the exact dates until very recently." Asked about Rubio's official bio the next day, spokesman Alex Conant confirmed, "the dates were wrong." "We just recently became aware of it, and it just hadn't been updated," he said. (The site updated the evening of Oct. 21, 2011 to say: "Marco was born in Miami in 1971 to Cuban exiles who first arrived in the United States in 1956.") Rubio learned the full story talking with his mom, Conant said, and looking at his parents' passports. (His father died in September 2010.) Instead of fleeing Castro's Cuba, the Rubios came to the United States for "economic opportunity," Conant said. Our ruling Several times during his race for U.S. Senate, Rubio told reporters and voters his parents left Cuba in 1959, suggesting they had fled Castro's rule. In his campaign bio, and later in his official Senate biography, he said his parents "came to America following Fidel Castro's takeover." Even after he stumbled over dates with a Miami Herald reporter and acknowledged his parents left before the revolution, his official Web bio stayed the same. After two news organizations reported his parents moved to the United States in 1956, his spokesman acknowledged that the bio was wrong. It was updated to say, "Marco was born in Miami in 1971 to Cuban exiles who first arrived in the United States in 1956." That puts everyone in agreement: The original statement is False. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/65ac0f9d-294e-4c82-b97b-173ab4305c5d	None	Marco Rubio	None	None	None	2011-10-21T18:11:34	2011-10-21	['United_States', 'Fidel_Castro', 'Cuba']

pomt-02023	"We’ve got an average of 5,600 soldiers committing suicide. That’s about 20 a day."	half-true	/georgia/statements/2014/jun/06/david-scott/not-all-veteran-suicides-can-be-tied-va-care/	The controversy over lengthy delays at several of the nation’s Veterans Affairs medical facilities, including the Atlanta VA Medical Center in DeKalb County, has drawn significant criticism that those waits may have contributed to veterans’ deaths. One such voice is U.S. Rep. David Scott, a Democrat who represents portions of metro Atlanta. Scott was among lawmakers from both parties calling for Veterans Affairs Secretary Eric Shinseki’s removal before the secretary resigned last Friday. In an interview with WABE just before that resignation, Scott tried to draw attention to the specific concern of mental health treatment in the scandal, which is compounded by allegations of efforts to cover up the delays. "We’ve got an average of 5,600 soldiers committing suicide," Scott said. "That’s about 20 a day." Back-of-a-napkin math shows an immediate miscalculation. That annual rate of suicides would mean 15 daily suicides. But even with the math blunder, those daily rates seemed striking enough for PolitiFact to want to get to the bottom of the matter. A spokesman for the congressman said he was first drawn to the issue of mental health services for veterans after reading an Atlanta Journal-Constitution investigation last year. In his WABE interview, Scott blamed Shinseki in particular and the VA in general, saying, "Nobody has been held accountable for all of those suicides." The AJC probe of the VA facility in DeKalb found that more than 500 veterans were on a waiting list to receive mental health care in 2010. Sixteen attempted suicide. The Atlanta VA tried to solve the problem by referring more veterans to outside treatment. But by 2012, that decision created long waiting lists at those outside clinics, according to the AJC investigation. Last year, federal audits tied the deaths of three veterans in Atlanta to poor oversight by hospital staff, including some who had been referred to outside facilities. It was later revealed that a fourth veteran committed suicide in a VA hospital bathroom, prompting the replacement of both the head of the hospital and the mental health director. "His big concern is for veterans who need help and can’t get it," said Scott’s chief of staff, Michael Andel. "It’s about the delay, especially in getting care in mental health needs." Andel referred us to an advocacy and support group, Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America, or IAVA, and a 2013 newspaper story about a VA study on suicide data. Both cite the daily estimate of 22 suicides by veterans. A closer look at the VA study, however, slightly complicates the issue. Based on the most extensive data ever collected by the VA on suicide, the report does calculate that 22 veterans die each day from suicide. But the estimate applies to all veterans, not soldiers who are on active or reserve services as Scott describes. The estimate relies on state data that identify the dead as veterans. It therefore includes those with or without any history of accessing VA care. A spokeswoman for the VA in Washington confirmed that the report also cites recent increases in the rates of suicide in the general population among middle-age adults between 35 and 64 years of age. The report found the majority of veteran suicides, about 70 percent, were by those age 50 and older. The report found that veterans make up a smaller percentage of the country’s suicides than a previous study in 2007. That suggests that an effort to improve suicide prevention programs at the VA had an effect, the report concludes, while also recommending additional improvements. "VA must continue to provide a high level of care, and recognize that there is still much more work to do," according to the study’s executive summary. "As long as Veterans die by suicide, we must continue to improve and provide even better services and care." Andel said Scott’s statement was a part of the congressman’s effort to use the study’s findings to push for change. Scott supports a proposal from U.S. Rep. Larry Bucshon, a Republican from Indiana, to offer employment incentives to psychiatrists who agree to work for the VA to help with the shortage of services. The IAVA has lobbied for a separate bill, the Senate’s Suicide Prevention for America's Veterans Act. Among other things, it calls for recruiting more health care workers to the VA and Department of Defense and reviewing those agencies’ suicide prevention programs. "We feel the system fails veterans, and that takes us to a point where unfortunately veterans are considering and committing suicide," said Nick McCormick, a legislative associate with the IAVA. "We want to get that information out so there can be change." To sum it up, though Scott is a little off on his math, he’s close enough on the daily rates for us. He has a point to drive home, that a lot of veterans are dying by their own hands. The problem is when he attempts to link the daily suicide rates of all military veterans, who may never have visited a VA center, with the current scandal. The study offers no evidence to back up the implication that blame lies with the VA on those deaths. With that context, we rate Scott’s statements as Half True.

pomt-04769	Says that Tennessee Gov. Bill Haslam "has made it clear by his repeated actions that he will pursue a policy that promotes the interest of Islamist (sic) and their radical ideology as long as he is governor."	pants on fire!	/tennessee/statements/2012/aug/27/billhislamcom/anti-muslim-website-says-bill-haslam-promotes-inte/	Earlier this summer, a handful of Republican Party county committees in Tennessee passed resolutions criticizing Republican Gov. Bill Haslam for hiring Samar Ali, an accomplished young Muslim-American native of Waverly, Tenn., and honors graduate of Vanderbilt University and its law school. Now, at least two new websites are attempting to perpetuate the idea that Tennessee’s governor is somehow involved in a massive conspiracy to "promote the interests" of "Islamist radical ideology," including "Shariah compliant finance." For the purposes of this item, we are going to examine a statement from billhislam.com: "The Governor of the great state of Tennessee, Bill Haslam, has made it clear by his repeated actions that he will pursue a policy that promotes the interest of Islamist (sic) and their radical ideology as long as he is governor." We’re feeling déjà vu. PolitiFact Tennessee addressed an associated claim in July when GOP state Senate candidate Woody Degan of Shelby County charged the Haslam administration was "making our Economic Development Department Sharia compliant," in part by hiring Ali as international director earlier this year. The governor and the Tennessee Department of Economic and Community Development (ECD) rejected the contention that Ali or the department was doing anything relating to Sharia. We gave it our Pants On Fire ruling as not just false, but ridiculous. At its simplest, Sharia law is the moral code and religious law of the Islamic faith, addressing a variety of personal and secular topics. Aspects of Sharia law do govern business dealings, and some Muslims conduct business only under Sharia-compliant conditions. For example, Sharia may prohibit interest on loans, considering it usury, but may allow other lending fees in lieu of interest. But most people, constitutional scholars and others, agree that attempting to install Sharia as U.S. or Tennessee law would be unconstitutional and there’s been no bills at the state level to attempt it. The voters of Senate District 32 gave Degan a drubbing. He got 10 percent of the vote against state Sen Mark Norris, R-Collierville, in their Aug. 2 primary. Despite that, the shadowy movement that Degan connected with during his campaign has not been deterred. In addition to billhislam.com, there’s another anonymous blog calling itself the "tn Council 4 political justice," which has posted 39 "newsletters" on its site since April 9, focused on the purported threat of Islam on Tennessee and the Haslam administration’s role in it. The latest of these, posted Aug. 23, attempts to link Samar Ali’s father, noted Waverly, Tenn., physician Subhi Ali, to The Jerusalem Fund. The anonymous bloggers write that the Washington, D.C.-based humanitarian non-profit’s policies "reflect overtly pro-Palestinian/pro-Hamas/anti-Israel positions." The bloggers also claim that "in addition to making grants for social services in the ‘Occupied Palestinian Territories,’" a branch of the Fund also "supports the Palestine Diabetes Institute" and that Samar Ali served as the transatlantic liaison during the development of that project. From diabetes to terrorism? Those behind billhislam.com make that leap: they titled their Aug. 23 link to the tn Council 4 political justice "newsletter" on Dr. Ali and the Jerusalem Fund as "Dr. Jihad." They go even further, with one post trying to connect the dots between "Sharia compliant finance investments" that the Haslam administration strongly denies going after to the potential maiming of American soldiers in Afghanistan. Dave Vance of Big Rock, Tenn., writes on billhislam.com that "Apparently, Governor Haslam is comfortable with the distinct possibility ... that at least some of the SCF (Sharia compliant finance) investments on which he intends to spend taxpayer funds will go to provide funds to the very people who are killing American troops in Afghanistan." It would be one thing if all this had stayed buried in the cyber netherworld but it worked its way into Degan’s campaigns and aforementioned resolutions passed by a few county GOP organizations (notably including the state’s most affluent county, Williamson). Even the governor feels compelled to spend time addressing it occasionally. Last week, his top assistant, Deputy to the Governor Claude Ramsey, wrote the chairman of the Tennessee Republican Party, Chris Devaney, a letter disputing the allegations so Devaney could assure the GOP faithful that their standard-bearer is not a radical Islamist. We will note that Haslam is an elder at Knoxville’s Cedar Springs Presbyterian Church, a congregation of the Evangelical Presbyterian Church. The blog and the website cite voluminous "research" in "connecting the dots," as one section of billhislam.com is labeled. But none of it that we’ve waded through has a shred of evidence to support the central claim. We received no response to inquiries to the site’s administrator, listed as Steven Curtis of Dover, Tenn., nor the contact email listed on the website. The inflammatory rhetoric, based upon no credible evidence we could discover, gets a ruling of Pants On Fire! UPDATE (Aug. 28, 2012): billhislim.com responded to our inquiry with an email after 11 p.m. on Aug. 27. The email address contained the name William Vance. It mostly reiterated points made on the website and urged media organizations to fact-check Gov. Haslam and his administration. The email can be viewed by clicking this link.

Rick Perry's administration has proposed ending immunizations for 113,000 kids.	mostly false	/texas/statements/2010/nov/20/mike-villarreal/state-rep-mike-villarreal-says-gov-rick-perrys-adm/	Democratic state Rep. Mike Villarreal of San Antonio sees the potential for "a public health disaster" in a document that lays out options for cutting the state health department's budget by 10 percent, according to a news release from his office. "Perry administration proposes ending immunizations for 113,000 kids," says the subject line of Villarreal's Sept. 7 statement. "We want Texas kids in school learning, rather than sitting at home or the doctor's office suffering from preventable diseases. ... If we don't prevent the spread of diseases among these children, we put at risk all Texas kids who are too young to receive their immunizations yet." An end to immunizations for thousands of youngsters? We wondered if Villarreal's shot hit the spot. First, some background on the federal Vaccines for Children program, which Texas has participated in since 1994. According to the website of the Texas Department of State Health Services, the program provides vaccines to health care providers for eligible children, including those who lack health insurance and those enrolled in the Children's Health Insurance Program and Medicaid. In 2010, the federal government spent more than $380 million on immunizations for children in Texas, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Carrie Williams, a spokeswoman for the state health services department, said 4.2 million Texas children qualified for the vaccinations under the federal program that year. To expand eligibility beyond the federal requirements, Texas pitches in some dollars so that any child who comes to a public health clinic can be immunized. The department is spending $7.1 million on the program in 2010-11 and expects to need $9.5 million for full funding in 2012-13. In May, Gov. Rick Perry and other state leaders, mindful of a looming revenue shortfall (lately pegged at $24 billion), asked state agencies to spell out possible 10 percent cuts in their budgets for 2012 and 2013. In August, the health services department laid out $238 million in possible reductions, with $7.7 million of that coming out of the state's spending on childhood immunizations. That proposal represents an 81 percent cut from what the agency expected to spend on the vaccination effort during 2012-13. The agency document, which Villarreal cites in his press release, describes the impact of the $7.7 million cut: "At this level of reduction, the overall safety-net program will need to reduce the number of children being vaccinated with GR funds (estimated 112,661 children). A significant portion of these children could be affected." GR refers to general revenue funds. The document further says: "This could end the public health clinic policy of turning no child away and instead will result in public clinics making referrals for those individuals that have health insurance to their medical homes for vaccines. If families are unable to go to their referral sites/medical homes, then the children may not be able to obtain vaccination services and could fall behind in the immunization schedule, ultimately lowering vaccine coverage levels and making our communities vulnerable to outbreaks of vaccine preventable diseases." A "medical home" is one's usual health-care provider. While Villarreal's press release also says the Department of State Health Services "estimates that half of the children could be immunized through other programs," he concludes that the end result of the budget cut would be to eliminate immunizations for 113,000 children. At the agency, Williams disputed Villarreal's interpretation. She said 112,661 is the number of kids the agency estimated would receive vaccines purchased with general revenue in 2012-13. If the Legislature reduces the state contribution to the vaccine program by $7.7 million, she said, the agency estimates that half of the 112,661 children — about 56,000 — would not be able to receive immunizations at public health clinics. However, Williams said, that doesn't mean those kids would necessarily go without. "They may have to seek their immunizations elsewhere, such as through their regular doctor," Williams said. And what would happen to the other 56,000 children? Williams said the agency expects that they would still be able to receive immunizations at public health clinics, but she did not specify how that would be accomplished. "We likely will have to fill in the gap with vaccine from other resources, possibly federal sources," she said, because state dollars alone may not be able to cover all of them. Upshot: There's a 56,000 difference between the number of children Villarreal said would no longer get immunized and the number of children the agency says could no longer be served at public health clinics if the proposed budget cut happens. Asked to explain the discrepancy, Villarreal told us by e-mail that he issued his September statement after his office discussed the August budget cut proposal with agency officials. "At that time, they communicated to us that the proposal would end funding for 113,000 children and about half of them could be expected to find services elsewhere," Villarreal said. "That's what I said in the first two sentences of my press release. The agency now says that we misunderstood. The point is the same either way: A very large number of our children would be left without immunizations." We asked Williams about that early September conversation between a Villarreal staffer and Nick Dauster, director of the agency's Government Affairs Unit. She said: "There must have been a misunderstanding between what was said and what was heard in a phone call a couple months ago. Admittedly, it’s a complex topic that involves estimates and unknowns, and our early information could have been clearer, which is why we provided clarification." The "clarification" was an e-mail sent from Dauster to Peter Clark, Villarreal's legislative director, on Sept. 1 — before Villarreal issued his press release — saying that "an estimated 56,000 children could be affected" by the cut in immunization funding. "This represents children who receive immunization services normally paid for by general revenue," Dauster wrote. Finally, we explored whether it makes sense to ascribe the agency-level proposal to the Perry "administration," as Villarreal's statement does. By law, the governor appoints the chief executives as well as the governing boards of some major agencies, including the Texas Health and Human Services Commission, whose Perry-appointed executive commissioner chooses the commissioner of the health services department in consultation with the governor. Also, Williams told us that the health services staff put together its budget reduction proposals with input from commission overseers. We asked Stephanie Goodman, a commission spokeswoman, if it was accurate to characterize the health services department ideas as "Perry administration proposals." Her response: "No. Our staff developed the options." She said the governor's office wasn't involved in deciding what cuts to propose. And how does Villarreal's statement that the Perry administration proposes ending immunizations for 113,000 kids shape up? We'll take his reference to the "Perry administration" as a defensible poke. And a state agency has proposed ending most of the general revenue funding for immunizations for that many kids. However, the suggestion that none of those 113,000 children would get vaccinated misstates the estimated impact of the proposed $7.7 million budget cut. While the state acknowledges that half the children would no longer be served under the immunization program — and some of those may have insurance coverage — it expects the rest would still get their shots at public health clinics. However, it says it doesn't yet know exactly how those immunizations would be paid for. We rate Villarreal's statement Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.

pomt-04295	Says the NAACP's Ohio chapter has endorsed Issue 2.	mostly false	/ohio/statements/2012/nov/01/voters-first-ohio/voters-first-ohio-claims-issue-2-endorsed-ohio-con/	Issue 2, the redistricting reform proposal on the Nov. 6 ballot with broad support from Democrats, has not gained unanimous support from black political leaders. The president of Ohio Legislative Black Caucus in September voiced concerns to Gongwer News Service about how Issue 2 would affect African-American representation in Congress and in the Ohio Senate and House of Representatives. In response to the caucus’ concerns, Sandy Theis, a spokeswoman for the pro-Issue 2 group Voters First Ohio, told Gongwer that the Ohio Conference NAACP has endorsed Issue 2. The website for Voters First also lists the organization – although it is labeled incorrectly as the NAACP Ohio Chapter – among the group’s endorsers. The splintered support for Issue 2 among black leaders got PolitiFact Ohio’s curiosity up, so it decided to look into where exactly the NAACP stands on Issue 2. Issue 2 is a proposed amendment to the Ohio Constitution that would reform the way the state's congressional and legislative boundaries are drawn, a process known as redistricting that happens every 10 years. Elected officials, including the governor and legislative leaders, control the current redistricting process. District boundary lines typically are drawn to favor whichever party is in power. Last year, Republicans, who control state government, drew new lines that grouped voters into districts designed to help Republicans win future elections. Issue 2 would remove elected officials from the redistricting process and hand the responsibility over to a new redistricting commission. Should Issue 2 pass, a commission would be appointed next year to draw new maps for the 2014 election. It’s worth pointing out that, under the new maps, Ohio voters could elect two black women to Congress this fall for the first time: incumbent Democrat Marcia Fudge, of Warrensville Heights, and Democrat Joyce Beatty, who is running in the Columbus-area 3rd District created during the GOP-controlled redistricting. The Ohio Legislative Black Caucus, due to concerns over future African-American political representation, has voted to not endorse Issue 2 since the Gongwer story was published on Sept. 25, said Rep. Sandra Williams, a Cleveland Democrat and president of the caucus. So where does the Ohio Conference NAACP stand on Issue 2? "The NAACP has not blanketly endorsed Issue 2," Sybil Edwards-McNabb, the organization’s president, said in a telephone interview on Oct. 24. Edwards McNabb said the group has concerns about how the proposed redistricting commission would operate and how the new system would affect African-American political representation. "We may not have the same representation," she said. "We could pick up more, but we might lose all of it. That’s a concern." Despite these concerns, Edwards-McNabb said it would be inaccurate to say the group does not support Issue 2. Huh? "Sometimes when you’re not saying ‘no’ somebody might perceive that as a ‘yes’ and that’s not necessarily true," Edwards-McNabb said. "But we are not against Issue 2. We need a change in our redistricting process. It needs to be thoroughly thought through. We need another level of clarity." If the Ohio NAACP officially has not endorsed Issue 2, we asked Edwards-McNabb if she asked Voters First to remove the group’s name from the list of Voters First supporters. She said an e-mail has been sent to Voters First. "We have a dialogue and our concerns have been heard," she said. We asked Theis why she told Gongwer the NAACP endorsed Issue 2. She said two Voters First consultants had conversations with two NAACP executives who support Voters First and support NAACP members who campaign for the passage of Issue 2. Tom Roberts, the Ohio Conference NAACP’s political action chair, is one group member campaigning for Issue 2. Roberts, who also is third vice president of the NAACP’s Dayton chapter, said members of the organization are free to support Issue 2. "I know it doesn’t make sense to some people, but we never got to the point of endorsement," he said in an interview on Oct. 17. "I think the safest thing to say is we don’t endorse it but we have agreed to support community involvement in the process." So where does that leave us? Although there appears to be some support for Issue 2 from within the Ohio Conference NAACP, the bottom line is that the group, as a whole, has not endorsed Issue 2. Voters First’s statement that the NAACP endorses the redistricting proposal contains an element of truth. The Ohio Conference NAACP president says there is support for changing the system for redistricting. But the organization also has concerns about the impact Issue 2 could have on black political representation, and it has not formally endorsed Issue 2. Those are critical facts absent from the Voters First claim that would give a different impression. On the Truth-O-Meter, the claim rates Mostly False.

pomt-06070	Says federal spending has increased 21 percent over the past three years.	mostly true	/ohio/statements/2012/jan/09/rob-portman/senator-rob-portman-says-federal-spending-rose-21-/	Sen. Rob Portman voted with a big Senate majority in December to extend the payroll tax holiday, but voiced concerns the same day about a separate $1 trillion bill financing the Pentagon and other federal agencies. "I just don't think this huge spending bill cuts enough," the Ohio Republican said. "With a 21 percent increase in federal spending over the past three years, Washington needs to cut back just as Ohio families have had to do." His news release called spending "out of control." That raised the eyebrows of PolitiFact Ohio. Has spending really increased by more than a fifth in three years? We asked Portman's office, and were pointed to an analysis issued in November by the Congressional Budget Office. Its first chart showed total federal outlays for 2008 of $2.98 trillion, compared with $3.6 trillion for 2011 -- an increase of 21 percent. That confirmed Portman's figure, but the numbers left us with questions. What was responsible for the big and bigger jumps in spending shown in 2008 and 2009, which would have been under the watch of President Bush? (President Obama's first budget was for fiscal 2010.) Why had outlays actually declined in 2010? We spoke with Jim Horney, vice president for federal fiscal policy at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. "The figure is right," he said about Portman's statement. But he said it would be wrong to conclude that the number shows a permanent increase in the rate of spending. The big increase in 2008 and "really big" jump in 2009 were mainly, Horney said, "the result of the downturn, which drives up spending, and of attempts to deal with it." The recession, which began in the 2007-2008 fiscal year, drove up spending in areas like unemployment insurance and safety net programs. Attempts to deal with it included the Troubled Asset Relief Program and the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act. "The big (spending) increase was driven by temporary factors. We're sort of leveling off now," Horney said. In the next three-year cycle, he noted, the projected spending of $3.6 trillion for 2012 is only 2.6 percent more than the actual outlays of $3.5 trillion in fiscal 2009-2012. The increase in the previous cycle, 2007-2010, was more than 27 percent. Portman's figure on spending was correct. But it is significant that the spending crosses administrations and is demonstrably tied to the faltering economy. That’s additional information that provides clarification.

pomt-00904	More than any Republican governor in the 2014 elections, "I took a higher percentage of the Republican vote"and "yet I also carried independents by 12 points."	mostly true	/wisconsin/statements/2015/mar/04/scott-walker/2016-horizon-scott-walker-asserts-his-appeal-among/	As he explores a run for the White House, Scott Walker is making a case for his electability, citing the fact he has won three elections for governor in four years. But he gives particular focus to the margins in his 2014 re-election victory. On Feb. 26, 2015, Walker spoke at the Conservative Political Action Conference, along with a host of other Republicans who are pondering a presidential run in 2016. The same day, he did an interview with Fox News talk show host Sean Hannity. Hannity's first question went to Walker’s electability: "How does a Republican win in Wisconsin because, on a presidential level, they haven't won since '84?" That was the year Ronald Reagan won a second term in a landslide. Since then, the state has gone Democratic seven straight times. "You've got to go big and you've got to go bold," Walker replied. He continued by describing his 2014 win for a second term, over Democrat Mary Burke: "I mean, ironically, I had solid support. In fact, I think more than any Republican governor in the country, I took a higher percentage of the Republican vote this last go-around, and yet I also carried independents by 12 points." We wondered about the numbers in Walker’s claim, one he repeated several days later in an interview with Chris Wallace on "Fox News Sunday." So, did Walker win a higher percentage of the Republican vote in 2014 than any other Republican governor? And did he also win independent voters by a margin of 12 points? 2014 exit polls Edison Research does exit polling for five TV networks and the Associated Press. The key data for this fact check are found in the responses to this question: "No matter how you voted today, do you usually think of yourself as a Democrat, Republican, independent or something else." The results showed that three incumbent Republicans won at least 95 percent of the GOP vote in gubernatorial races (the GOP incumbent who won re-election with the lowest share of the GOP vote was Sam Brownback of Kansas, at 80 percent): Governor Percentage of Republican vote Terry Branstad, Iowa 97% Scott Walker, Wisconsin 96% John Kasich, Ohio 95% Two notes: Republican Greg Abbott won 96 percent of the GOP vote in winning the Texas governor's race. But he was running for an open seat. And exit polls, like any poll, have a margin of error and the difference between 96 percent and 97 percent are within the margin of error. At the same time, they are the best numbers available. So, Walker’s Republican support was extremely high, but not quite the highest. (On the other side, Walker won only 6 percent of the vote from Democrats. That 90-point partisan gap -- 96 percent of the GOP vote versus 6 percent of the Democratic vote – was the biggest of any 2014 candidate for governor in states where exit polls were done, according to the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel's Craig Gilbert, who writes The Wisconsin Voter blog.) As for the second part of Walker’s claim, the Wisconsin exit poll found that among voters who identified themselves as independent or something else, Walker outperformed Burke by 54 percent to 43 percent. That’s a margin of 11 points, one point less than what Walker claimed. Our rating Walker said that more than any Republican governor in the 2014 elections, "I took a higher percentage of the Republican vote" and "yet I also carried independents by 12 points." Exit polls show both parts of the claim are slightly off. Walker’s 96 percent support from Republicans was second to Iowa Gov. Terry Branstad’s 97 percent. And among independent voters in Wisconsin, Walker led Democratic challenger Mary Burke by 11 points, not 12. For a statement that is accurate but needs clarification, Walker earns a Mostly True.

pomt-12675	"Texas legislators have filed voucher proposals in every legislative session since 1995, but all of them have failed to become law."	true	/texas/statements/2017/mar/16/coalition-public-schools-coalition-public-schools/public-school-advocates-say-no-voucher-legislati/	Near the start of this year’s legislative session, Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick stood on the Capitol’s steps and exhorted lawmakers in the House and Senate to vote on "school choice" legislation, saying it’s "it's easy to kill a bill when no one gets to vote on it." An advocacy group opposed to public funds supporting students going to private and religious schools urged a different course. In a Jan. 23, 2017, press release, the Coalition for Public Schools, which says it represents religious, child advocacy and education organizations, urged the Legislature to "focus its efforts on providing support for our neighborhood public schools instead of funneling public tax dollars" to private school "voucher schemes with little or no accountability for how our tax dollars are spent." The eight-paragraph release closed with a historical claim: "Texas legislators have filed voucher proposals in every legislative session since 1995, but all of them have failed to become law." That’d be a big 0-for-10 for voucher proponents because state lawmakers convene in regular session every odd-numbered year. We decided to check the record. For starters, we knew that Texans in 2017 can’t access government-backed vouchers to attend nonpublic schools. Nationally as of December 2016, 27 states afforded some kind of private school choice--and 14 states had voucher plans in law, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures, a bipartisan group that offers "support, ideas, connections and a strong voice on Capitol Hill" for legislators. Wondering how the coalition reached its claim, we contacted a coalition member, the Texas Freedom Network, which says it watchdogs far-right issues, organizations, money and leaders. The network’s Jose Medina, who’d distributed the coalition’s release, emailed us a web link to a 2007 network report including an appendix listing Texas "voucher legislation" dating to 1993. Medina also pointed us to the network’s "legislative watch" web page showing bills filed under topics including vouchers from 1999 through 2015. Defining vouchers We paused to cover some definitions. Huriya Jabbar, a University of Texas education administration professor who has studied school choice and the political dimensions of education reforms, told us that "school choice" can include access to charter schools or the option to transfer to a different public school. Meanwhile, "private school choice" involves the use of public funds for private or parochial education. Asked about defining school vouchers alone, Jabbar pointed us to a 2015 article in Education Week, which covers schooling from kindergarten through high school. The article, "What's the Difference Between Vouchers and Education Savings Accounts?," explains differences in private school options that often get described collectively as vouchers, a "politically loaded term," the author wrote. The article says vouchers give parents "public funding allocated for their child toward tuition at a private school of their choice, including religiously affiliated private schools." Education savings accounts, similar to vouchers, can also pay for private tuition, the story says, though money in an account could be put toward out-of-class educational expenses such as tutoring or online enrichment. States that support such accounts set aside funds based on per-pupil funding estimates; parents may withdraw money for approved expenses, the story says. In Texas in 2017, state Sen. Larry Taylor, R-Friendswood, filed Senate Bill 3 proposing education savings accounts for students from all income levels plus scholarships for students with the "greatest financial and academic need," Taylor’s measure states, to be supported by tax credits. That’s a funding approach taken by 17 states as of December 2016, according to the NCSL. States employ the credits, the article says, to "incentivize businesses or individuals to donate money to a scholarship-granting organization, which then gives money to students" to use for tuition at a private school. Texas is one of the states with constitutional amendments (often referred to as Blaine Amendments) that prohibit state funds from going to religious organizations. In those states, the Education Week article says, tax credit scholarships and education savings accounts "offer workarounds." We asked Josh Cunningham, an NCSL education policy specialist, if education savings accounts and tax credit scholarships would reasonably be grouped with vouchers in that each approach furthers public funding of non-public schooling. Cunningham suggested they could, as "they all for the most part serve a similar purpose, providing support for a public school student to enter into private school." Dozens of proposals Next, let’s review what we spotted in legislation considered since the 1995 session, which we based on text searches of "voucher," "scholarship" and "education savings account," to cover bills that dealt with public funding for private school tuition. We ran the terms through both the Texas Legislative Service website Telicon and the Texas Legislature online, which is managed by the Texas Legislative Council, session by session, coming up with 29 proposed bills related to school choice with funding in the form of vouchers, scholarships or savings accounts. We then checked each of the bills listed in the Coalition for Public Schools’ list in both services, to account for any that our search may have missed. In total, we found 54 relevant bills from every session that covered private "school choice" options. Among the proposals over the years, 11 envisioned pilot programs limited to certain student populations. For instance, House Bill 2366, which didn’t advance out of a House committee in 1999, called for a pilot program for "educationally disadvantaged" students. Six years later, HB 3042, which died in committee, more broadly called for vouchers for all students eligible to attend public schools.

A form of public school choice, short of private-school vouchers, passed into law in 1995 when lawmakers created the Public Education Grant program open to students in any school where half the students or more didn’t perform satisfactorily on state tests the three previous years or the school was declared "low performing" by the state during those years, according to a 1997 House Research Organization summary. Under the law, each eligible student could attend a school in another district backed by the state and local funding provided for their education in their original district. In 1997, lawmakers widened such opportunities via HB 318 authorizing the state to fund up to 100 "open-enrollment charter schools," which students could attend with the grants, and otherwise allowing eligible students to apply a grant to attend another school in their home districts. Among other tweaks, a student would newly be eligible if half or more of a school’s students performed unsatisfactorily in any two of three previous years. A sampling of voucher proposals that died Also in 1997, Rep. Ron Wilson, D-Houston, proposed an amendment to a proposal that would’ve allowed students from low-performing schools to transfer to a private school and have tuition covered by state funds, provided the student attempted to enroll in another public school and was rejected. But House members deadlocked 68-68 on the amendment, which Wilson then withdrew after "voucher opponents rounded up some absent members who could have killed his measure," according to a May 8, 1997 Houston Chronicle news article. At the time, state Rep. Henry Cuellar, D-Laredo, called that moment the House’s "closest vote ever" on vouchers. Among other measures that would put public funds toward private school costs that didn’t become law was HB 2465, offered in 2003 by Rep. Kent Grusendorf, R-Arlington and chairman of the House Public Education Committee. Grusendorf’s plan would have created the Education Freedom Program for students in the state’s heaviest-enrollment districts. The bill’s analysis states that under the proposal, if a district served more than 40,000 students and a majority qualified as "educationally disadvantaged," those students whose families met certain financial requirements could attend private schools with state aid. The bill won the endorsement of the House Public Education panel by 5-3, but didn’t make it to the House floor before the session ended. According to minutes of the House Calendars Committee, that panel voted 7-0 on May 10, 2003, not to move the legislation to the House "at this time." Before the education committee acted, according to an April 4, 2003 news story in the Dallas Morning News, HB 2465 was fiercely debated with teacher groups and local school boards arguing against approval, saying the legislation would "rob the public schools of millions of dollars at a time when many are cutting programs." Proponents, such as Chris Patterson with the Texas Public Policy Foundation, said that some children are still left behind in Texas, despite improvements to public education over the past two decades. A dozen years later, in the 2015 legislative session, Senate Bill 4, authored by Sens. Taylor; Paul Bettencourt, R-Houston; and Donna Campbell R-New Braunfels, would have given a low-income student or a student with disabilities a tax-credit scholarship to "attend the school of their choice," public or private. A bill analysis by the Senate Research Center added that the bill would have allowed businesses to make donations to an "educational scholarship organization" and thus receive a tax credit for the donation. According to an April 2015 news story in the Austin American-Statesman, the 31-member Senate gave preliminary approval to the bill on a "mixed 18-12 vote after rejecting a handful of Democratic-proposed amendments to the measure." A Democrat, Sen. Eddie Lucio, Jr. of Brownsville, voted for the proposal, the story said, with Republican Sens. Robert Nichols of Jacksonville and Konni Burton of Colleyville voting against it. In the House, where the measure died May 5, 2015 after it was referred to the Ways and Means committee, Republicans such as House Public Education Chairman Rep. Jimmie Don Aycock of Killeen expressed concern with the state’s abilities to hold private schools accountable to the same standards as public schools. We reached out to organizations supportive of educational savings accounts to see how this claim stacked up in their eyes -- the Texas Public Policy Foundation and Texans for Education Opportunity. The foundation’s Caroline Espinosa, declined to comment. We didn’t hear back from Texans for Education Opportunity. Our ruling The coalition said: "Texas legislators have filed voucher proposals in every legislative session since 1995, but all of them have failed to become law." All told, we identified 54 failed bills, at least one in each of the 11 regular sessions from 1995 through 2015, that proposed the use of public funds for private school tuition, though not every one was a pure voucher proposal.

pomt-04933	Says his "patents in ultrasound have revolutionized modern medicine."	pants on fire!	/tennessee/statements/2012/jul/30/george-flinn/memphis-candidate-george-flinn-claims-his-patents-/	Dr. George Flinn is well known in Memphis as a radiologist, radio station magnate and a big-spending, self-funding Republican political candidate who is running for Congress again this summer, this time in Tennessee’s 9th Congressional District. Fewer know him as an inventor with patents on file in Washington, but that’s what he claims in a commercial he’s airing as he seeks to defeat 2010 GOP nominee Charlotte Bergmann. The winner in Thursday’s Aug. 2 primary will face the winner of the primary between incumbent U.S. Rep. Steve Cohen and school board member Tomeka Hart. The commercial boldly claimsthat Flinn is "a doctor whose patents in ultrasound have revolutionized modern medicine, whose innovations have saved lives throughout the world." Based on the scant evidence we were able to discover and our lack of deep knowledge in the history of ultrasound technology, we are narrowing the focus to whether Flinn does indeed hold patents in ultrasound technology that might have revolutionized modern medicine. The only Flinn patent we were able to find was awarded on July 3, 2007, and it is not for ultrasound technology. Flinn and two others received patent No. 7,238,370 B2 for their invention of a substance made of pumice and an aqueous surfactant (like a detergent) that experiments showed increased skin thickness and gave it a "more youthful appearance." It was also tested on shaved guinea pigs. Its claim is that it prevents and treats "photoaging" of skin. Whatever the usefulness of this substance, we’re comfortable concluding it has not revolutionized modern medicine. It took Flinn’s campaign more than a week to provide information about other innovations the campaign believes backs up Flinn’s claims. OnThursday evening, July 26, campaign manager Kristi Stanley sent along three acknowledgement letters from the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office confirming receipt of applications for patents. Not patents, but applications for patents. The letters state that the information Flinn provided (which was not provided to PolitiFact) "will be examined for patentability." The letters also extend Flinn the right under federal law to seek a patent in foreign countries. Nothing that Stanley provided indicates Flinn sought foreign patents. She did note that Flinn also was involved in obtaining patents while employed by the National Institutes of Health that are held, not by him, but by that government agency. So let’s look at the three patent applications, according to the initial letters from the Patent and Trademark Office dated in May and June of this year. One (Customer No. 062439) is for "Chemotherapy Treatment Using Microspheres to Deliver a High Concentration of a Drug to a Tumor." The letter provided by Stanley provides no other information about the patent itself, just details about Flinn’s rights. It does not appear to deal with ultrasound. The second is titled "Process for an Improved Galactogram Procedure," with, again, no supporting description or detail. The third: "Color Encoding Method for Ultrasound Images." Again: No detail. We could explain that galactography is the examination of the breast by mammography and, specifically, examination of the milk ducts, or that microspheres are particles smaller than one millimeter in diameter. But it seems we can make short work of this analysis by saying that, although Flinn claims to deserve the patent for them, these are not patented inventions and he only sought them after he was deeply involved in this congressional campaign. If the technologies are being employed in medicine to demonstrative salubrious effect, it isn’t because they are his patents because the patents have not yet been granted. When contacted initially, the campaign indicated it was eager for us to examine the claim but did not provide the kind of supportive documentation that would establish its veracity. Instead, the documentation establishes the application for patents. But Flinn’s commercials flatly claim he his patents in ultrasound technology revolutionized modern medicine, when the record shows he he only applied for patents several months after this congressional campaign was under way. That kind of deliberate deception of voters earns this claim a Pants On Fire!	None	George Flinn	None	None	None	2012-07-30T03:00:00	2012-07-05	['None']
pomt-13483	"In an interview with the Chicago Tribune's Editorial Board, Comptroller Leslie Munger says that in order to balance a budget, the state would have to 'cut social services completely.'"	false	/illinois/statements/2016/sep/08/seiu-healthcare-illinois-indiana/healthcare-union-twists-leslie-munger-comments/	On paper, the race for Illinois state comptroller is about which candidate is best qualified to be keeper of the state's checkbook. In reality, though, it's become an extension of the bitter budget war that's been waged for more than a year between Republican Gov. Bruce Rauner and Democratic House Speaker Michael Madigan. Democrats and their supporters are doing everything possible to link incumbent Republican Leslie Geissler Munger to Rauner’s "reforms before revenue" position that has perpetuated the budget impasse and hurt social social service providers. Democratic comptroller candidate and Chicago City Clerk Susana Mendoza has made the connection the central theme of her campaign. In a YouTube video published Aug. 29, SEIU Healthcare of Illinois and Indiana, a union that represents health care and child care workers and is one of the sharpest critics of the anti-union Rauner, zeroed in on Munger for remarks she made during an Aug. 25 Chicago Tribune editorial board debate. SEIU claims Munger, who was appointed by then-Gov.-elect Rauner after the sudden death of Judy Baar Topinka in December 2014, said the state would have to "cut social services completely" in order to balance the budget. The 40-second YouTube video takes clips from the debate with the state’s four comptroller candidates, and includes a description that says: "In an interview with the Chicago Tribune’s Editorial Board, Comptroller Leslie Munger says that in order to balance a budget, the state would have to ‘cut social services completely.’" The union repeated the charge in a tweet: Politicians frequently argue about how to better manage social services, but we’ve never heard of any candidate advocating eliminating all programs that assist society’s most vulnerable citizens. We decided to look into SEIU’s claim. Context of comptroller’s comments James Muhammad, communications director for SEIU Healthcare Illinois Indiana, confirmed the YouTube video was referencing comments Munger made during the editorial board debate. Munger was asked by the editorial board whether she agrees with Rauner that reforms from his Turnaround Agenda must be passed before there’s an agreement on a full-year budget. Rauner sees his plan as helping business; his opponents see it as an anti-union assault in the guise of reform. While the comptroller did not answer the question directly, Munger said workers’ compensation reform and a property tax freeze are two of the governor’s reform items she believes would help businesses create more jobs, expand the tax base and grow the economy. This is where the SEIU YouTube video claims Munger said the state would have to "cut social services completely" to balance the budget. "We have to pass a balanced budget. I don’t know how you pass a balanced budget, unless you literally cut social services completely as an example, cut education," Munger said. "You cannot get to a balanced budget without a growing economy in our state right now. We cannot do it." The video includes Munger’s comments in their entirety, though both the title and the description imply the comptroller was saying the state needs to completely eliminate funding for social services to balance the budget. Despite Munger making clear she was using such cuts as "an example" to illustrate how drastic cuts alone would have to be, SEIU makes it appear as if Munger wants and is proposing to eliminate all funding for social services in the video as well as on its social media accounts. Munger reiterated her support for an income tax increase as long as it’s "coupled" with reductions in spending, noting the current individual income tax rate of 3.75 percent would have to be hiked up to about 8 percent just to pay down the state’s current $8.1 billion backlog of unpaid bills. "You cannot cut enough to get to a balanced budget, so you need revenue," Munger said during the debate. "And you cannot raise revenue enough to get it balanced without a growing economy." This statement also debunks SEIU’s contention that Munger wants to "cut social services completely," and further clarifies she was saying the state never would be able to make cuts as severe as what you would need to balance the budget as things currently stand. Our ruling In a YouTube video, SEIU Healthcare Illinois and Indiana said: "In an interview with the Chicago Tribune's Editorial Board, Comptroller Leslie Munger says that in order to balance a budget, the state would have to ‘cut social services completely.’" The video, along with a tweet from the union’s Twitter account, gives the impression Munger wants to cut all funding for social services in order to balance the budget. However, both the video and the tweet take Munger’s comments out of context and fail to acknowledge she was speaking hypothetically. In addition, Munger’s statement that the state "cannot cut enough to get to a balanced budget" and "cannot raise revenue enough to get it balanced without a growing economy" undercuts SEIU’s contention that she wants to cut all social services. Essentially, Munger’s point is that lawmakers never would be able to make cuts as severe as what would be needed to balance the budget without new revenue. We rate SEIU Illinois’ claim False. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/1390c5e4-4748-4f05-a7a2-50b8fe2a3698	None	SEIU Healthcare Illinois & Indiana	None	None	None	2016-09-08T18:40:02	2016-08-25	['Chicago_Tribune']

pomt-04817	"While (Barack) Obama preaches ‘we are our brother’s keeper,’ his brother and aunt live in real poverty in Kenya."	mostly true	/texas/statements/2012/aug/17/bill-zedler/texas-legislator-says-barack-obama-says-were-our-b/	State Rep. Bill Zedler lofted a double-sided claim about Barack Obama the day the Democratic president raised money by stumping in Texas. The Arlington Republican said in a July 17, 2012, Twitter post: "While Obama preaches ‘we are our brother’s keeper,’ his brother & aunt live in real poverty in Kenya." Obama often says Americans should care for one another. He said in his weekly radio address of Nov. 24, 2011: "This sense of mutual responsibility – the idea that I am my brother’s keeper; that I am my sister’s keeper – has always been a part of what makes our country special." He revisited that sentiment in his radio address of Dec. 24, 2011 and in a Feb. 2, 2012, speech at the National Prayer Breakfast in Washington, a Feb. 28, 2012, address to the United Auto Workers and a March 30, 2012, campaign speech in Burlington, Vt. And are the president’s brother and aunt impoverished in Kenya, as Zedler says? Obama has no Kenyan brothers. But by email, Zedler told us he relied on an excerpt of an interview of Obama’s Kenyan half-brother, George Obama, by Dinesh D’Souza, a former policy adviser to President Ronald Reagan and author of a 2010 book, "The Roots of Obama’s Rage." George and Barack Obama had the same father. Zedler said he learned of the aunt’s conditions from a Fox News report featuring D’Souza. On July 17, 2012, D’Souza told Fox News host Sean Hannity that George Obama is living in "third-world poverty... And Obama won’t lift a finger to help him," according to a transcript of the appearance we obtained via the Nexis database. D’Souza also told Hannity that Obama has an aunt, his late father’s sister, "who as we speak is selling coal on the streets of Kenya for a couple dollars a day." A sizable share of Kenyans live in poverty. According to the Kenya section of the CIA’s "World Factbook," 50 percent of the nation’s residents lived below the poverty line as of 2000. As of 2005, according to the World Bank, the share of Kenyans living under the nation’s poverty line was 46 percent. For this article, we hunted for evidence that Obama’s half-brother and aunt live in poverty and that President Obama has not helped either one. By email, D’Souza told us he was referring to Hawa Auma Obama, whose brother was the president’s father. D’Souza said his information originated in a 2011 book by reporter Sally H.Jacobs, "The Other Barack," a biography of Obama’s father. Jacobs writes in the book that Hawa Auma, a widow, lives in a Kenyan village where she "spends most of her days sitting at the edge of the dirt road next to a pile of charcoal stubs that she sells" for about 40 cents per 2-kilogram tin. The aunt delights in a set of glasses that then-Sen. Obama gave her; he also gave her about $140 when he visited in 2006, Jacobs writes. "She wonders aloud if he will pay to get her teeth fixed," she writes. D’Souza’s videotaped interview of George Obama, placed on YouTube July 10, 2012, is described by the Hollywood Reporter as folding into a soon-to-be released movie featuring D’Souza, "2016: Obama’s America." In the interview, D’Souza tells George Obama that he had seen articles on CNN and elsewhere in the 2008 election year suggesting Barack Obama had not "done anything to help you." "I think he has a family of his own," George Obama replies. "He is supposed to help his family." D’Souza: "...Don’t you think you’re part of his family?" Obama: "Yeah, I’m part of his family. But I’m over it. I can help myself." D’Souza: "...Well, let me put it a different way. Recently, President Obama spoke and he was quoting from the famous story, of Cain and Abel, that we are our brother’s keeper." D’Souza asked George Obama: "Now my point is, you are his brother. Has he been your keeper?" Obama: "Go ask him. He’s got other issues to deal with." D’Souza: "Well, he’s taking care of the world, but don’t you start at home?" Obama: "Yeah, he’s taking care of the world. So he’s taking care of me. I’m part of the world." Obama then agreed the president doesn’t have to help him directly. D’Souza told the Hollywood Reporter that he met George Obama at a Nairobi hotel and they spent about 12 hours together. D’Souza is also quoted saying George Obama "lives in rubble on a few dollars a day while his powerful, multi-millionaire brother doesn't lift a finger to help him." By email, D’Souza told us that George Obama told him he lives on around $10 a month. In D’Souza’s 2010 book on the president, he writes that he read a 2008 London Telegraph news article on George Obama which showed him standing outside a ramshackle hut on Nairobi’s outskirts. That Aug. 20, 2008, Telegraph article actually summarizes an article in the Italian edition of Vanity Fair magazine, which said that George Obama, then 26, had met his American half-brother twice -- once when he was a youngster and again in 2006 when Barack Obama visited Nairobi. In his 2010 book, "Homeland," George Obama wrote that he was nervous about the 2006 visit with his half-brother, who was then a U.S. senator. "I was the kid from the slum, the Obama son who had been a gangster and served time," he wrote, adding that they greeted each other and shook hands toward the end of a family gathering. He wrote, too, that the pair lacked time for a conversation stretching to issues in the "ghetto" that he and others were trying to address. In the book, he said he briefly saw his half-brother again at a Nairobi hotel and the senator said he would call to chat longer, but no call came. As Obama won the 2008 Democratic presidential nomination, George Obama said he agreed to be interviewed by a European journalist -- evidently the one who wrote the article for the Italian Vanity Fair. The Vanity Fair article, as recapped by the Telegraph, quoted George Obama as saying: "No-one knows who I am. I live here on less than a dollar a month." An accompanying photo is captioned: "George Hussein Onyango Obama, Sen. Barack Obama's long lost brother, was tracked down living in a hut on the outskirts of Nairobi." George Obama wrote in his book that he was photographed standing in the gateway of his late aunt’s home. He added: "No one could live on a dollar a day, let alone on three and a half cents a day, not even a Nairobi ghetto-dweller like me." He lives in a slum, Obama conceded, but did not resent that or feel his brother should do something about his situation. "No way," George Obama wrote. In the book, Obama further wrote that he later told a CNN reporter, David McKenzie: "I was brought up well; I live well even now." He said he did a similar interview with the London Times; an Aug. 22, 2008, article is available to paying readers on the Times’ website. D’Souza’s book says a 2008 CNN report -- perhaps the one mentioned in his interview of George Obama -- confirmed the Telegraph’s account. That’s not entirely so. The Oct. 22, 2008, CNN report describes George Obama as angered by the Italian Vanity Fair article. "I was brought up well. I live well even now," CNN reported Obama as saying. "The magazines, they have exaggerated everything. I think I kind of like it here. There are some challenges, but maybe it is just like where you come from, there are the same challenges." So, while George Obama lives in a slum, there are no indications he has been waiting for his half-brother to bail him out. For another observer’s take, we asked Washington Post journalist David Maraniss, who travelled to Kenya while researching his 2012 book on Barack Obama’s roots, about Zedler’s claim. Maraniss replied that the president has many Kenyan relatives with "varying economic circumstances." He said he did not visit George Obama. Separately, we emailed the White House about Zedler’s claim, drawing no reply. Our ruling President Obama, who often refers to being our brother’s keepers, has a half-brother, George Obama, living in a Nairobi slum and, as of 2011, a Kenyan aunt who sold charcoal by the road. The president gave the aunt some money in 2006, according to Jacobs’ account. There appears to be no sign of his otherwise helping his aunt or half-brother. Finally, Zedler's statement implies the president is not addressing distant family needs. That’s at least slightly misleading in that the half-brother has said he doesn’t expect such aid. Notably, too, there appear to be no signs of the president revealing that he is or is not privately pitching in. We rate the claim Mostly True.

pomt-04456	"Since President Obama took office, there are over 450,000 more unemployed women."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/oct/10/mitt-romney/mitt-romney-ad-says-under-barack-obama-there-are-4/	A new ad from Mitt Romney's campaign uses small-business owner Melanie McNamara to make the case that Obama hasn't helped the economy -- particularly for women. "He promised to bring us all together, that we're all going to be able to prosper," she says in the ad. "I don't see the prospering." She voted for him 2008 but won't this time, she says. An on-screen visual says, "Since President Obama took office, there are over 450,000 more unemployed women." In exploring whether that number is accurate, we should note that economists say raw numbers are problematic because the population grows over time and the desire to join the labor force can wax and wane for reasons beyond broad economic conditions. In examining the Romney campaign's claim, we find the numbers can be tallied different ways to tell two very different stories. The outcome depends on when you start counting. If you start in January 2009, the month that Obama took office, there has been a 451,000 increase in the number of unemployed women 16 and up through the latest report, which was issued last week. But start the count later and you get a much different picture. The Obama campaign often uses February 2010, which was the point when monthly job changes turned from negative to positive. The problem is, each party’s approach amounts to cherry picking. Starting the count on the day Obama was sworn in ignores the reality that no president can have much impact on the economy in their first weeks or even months on the job -- a point that’s particularly important in Obama’s case because the job numbers were in a virtual free fall when he began his term on January 2009. On the other hand, starting the count at the low point, one year after taking office, shields Obama from any responsibility for more than a year. We’ve often taken a middle ground, starting the count in June 2009, which was the official start of the recovery, and a few months after Obama’s stimulus law took effect. As it turns out, using June 2009 makes a major difference in the result. Between June 2009 and September 2012, the number of unemployed women actually decreased by 548,000. There’s also another way to look at it -- to compare the 44 months after January 2009 to the 44 months prior to January 2009. During this period -- the final 44 months of George W. Bush’s presidency -- the number of unemployed women rose by almost 1.4 million. That’s more than triple the increase in unemployed women that we found even under the least flattering measurement for Obama. And if you look at Bush’s entire eight-year term, the number of unemployed women rose by more than 2.2 million. Even accounting for Bush’s longer tenure, that’s a rise far more rapid than occurred under Obama. Our ruling The Romney campaign claimed that "since President Obama took office, there are over 450,000 more unemployed women." That’s literally true, but the statistic is cherry-picked. Starting the count at the beginning of the recovery, rather than the beginning of Obama’s term, produces a starkly different result -- a decrease of 548,000 unemployed women. And the rise in women’s unemployment under Obama pales compared to the rise experienced under George W. Bush. These important pieces of context are left out of the ad. On balance, we rate the claim Half True.	None	Mitt Romney	None	None	None	2012-10-10T18:09:10	2012-10-06	['Barack_Obama']

pomt-13394	"The gun epidemic is the leading cause of death of young African-American men, more than the next nine causes put together."	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/sep/26/hillary-clinton/hillary-clinton-correct-gun-deaths-young-black-mal/	During the first presidential debate at Hofstra University, Hillary Clinton decried gun violence, especially as it impacts young African-Americans. "The gun epidemic is the leading cause of death of young African-American men, more than the next nine causes put together," she said. This is a claim Clinton has made before, and it’s accurate. We found the relevant data on the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention website. Using this search form, we collected data on the 10 most common causes of death for African-American men and boys between the ages of 15 and 24, for 2014: There were 2,256 gun-related homicides in 2014, compared to 2,119 deaths in the next nine categories combined. This makes Clinton’s statement correct. If you add in the accidents and suicides related to guns, the gap between gun-related deaths and other types of deaths expands even further. There were 2,533 gun-related deaths in all 10 categories combined, compared to 2,002 deaths in the top 10 categories that had nothing to do with guns. We should note that this statement is dependent on the age range chosen. For instance, the statement is not correct for African-American boys between age 10 and 14. There were 38 gun-related homicides in that age and racial group in 2014, plus 10 gun suicides and three unintentional injuries caused by guns, for a total of 51. By contrast, the top 10 causes of death for that age and racial group included 271 deaths that had nothing to do with guns, such as diseases. That said, we think using the definition of "young" as 15-24 is a reasonable one. Our ruling Clinton said, "The gun epidemic is the leading cause of death of young African-American men, more than the next nine causes put together." As long as you define "young" as being between the ages of 15 and 24, Clinton’s statement is accurate, according to CDC data.

pomt-01173	"We are younger than our competitors, and this is entirely because of immigration."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2014/dec/09/barack-obama/america-younger-competitors-because-immigration/	We’re not sure what a sexy argument for immigration reform would sound like, but President Barack Obama admitted that one he offered last week was a bit on the wonky side. "It's not a sexy argument to make to the public, but we are younger than our competitors, and that is entirely because of immigration," Obama told a group of business executives. "And when you look at the problems that China, Japan, Europe, Russia, are all going to have, a lot of it just has to do with their getting old. And we stay young because were constantly being replenished by these striving families from around the world. And we should want that to continue." We agree that this argument isn’t sexy. But is it accurate? The age of the population is important to a country because taxes generated by incomes of young workers support health care costs and Social Security benefits for those who are no longer working. We’ll take his claim in two parts. U.S. vs its competitors Is the United States younger than its competitors? "Competitors" is a loose term, but judging by the countries Obama listed, he’s comparing the United States to other large economies. There are a few ways we can determine whether a country is "young." We can compare median ages between countries. Or we can look at the percentage of the population that falls between certain age groups. Finally, we can look at demographic projections for what their age breakdown will be at a point in the future. Let’s take the top 15 countries by gross domestic product (GDP) and use the various models to compare their ages. Country Median age Percent of population under 24 Percent of population under 54 Percent of population 65 and older in 2050 United States 37.6 33.1 73.0 21.4 China 36.7 31.8 79.0 23.9 Japan 46.1 22.9 61.0 36.5 Germany 46.1 23.6 65.3 32.7 France 40.9 30.6 69.2 25.5 United Kingdom 40.4 29.9 70.9 24.7 (Great Britain only) Brazil 30.7 40.3 84.0 22.5 Russia 38.9 27.1 72.9 20.5 Italy 44.5 23.6 66.6 33.0 India 27.0 46.6 87.2 12.7 Sources: CIA World Factbook and Pew Research Center. In each case, it does appear that the United States is among the youngest countries. It’s certainly much younger than the European Union nations and Japan, and that trend will hold through the mid 21st century. You can also look at the European Union as a separate entity. It consists of many of the countries that belong to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, a group of advanced, industrialized economies. In the European Union, about 26 percent of the population is under the age of 24, and 66 percent are under 54 years old. By both measurements, the United States is younger than the European Union. The biggest exceptions are Brazil and India, two countries that have booming populations and large GDPs, but which began to industrialize later than the United States, Europe and Japan, and neither are considered advanced economies. The most interesting comparisons are China and Russia. Their age structure is relatively close to that in the United States. China, according to the CIA World Factbook, has a slightly younger median age than the United States and a larger percentage of its population is under the age of 54. On the other hand, with fewer very young people, China is expected to have a larger share of its population over 65 by 2050. China’s longstanding one-child policy, though softened recently, has created future demographic challenges for the country as well. Russia is slightly older than the United States when measured by median age, but it will have a smaller portion of its population over 65 in 2050. Bottom line: Brazil and India are clearly younger than the United States, and China and Russia are in the same ballpark, but the United States is younger than key European countries and Japan. The immigration affect The second question is what role immigration plays in keeping America’s population relatively young? The short answer is: Quite a bit, though the exact extent is hard to quantify. Obama’s statement is generally on point, said Jeffrey Passel, senior demographer for the Pew Research Center. A 2014 Pew report, "Attitudes About Aging," found that the United States has four times the immigrant population than any other country with Russia a distant second. The percentage of immigrants in the U.S. population was the third-highest of all the countries studied in the Pew report. Researchers estimate that 50 percent of the United States’ population growth from 1960 to 2005 stems from immigrants and their descendants. "Without immigration, U.S. population growth from 2005 to 2050 would be only 8.5 percent, more on par with that of European nations," the report concluded. If that were the case, the United States, like Europe, would be on path where its fertility rates fell short of replacement level — that is, not reproducing fast enough to replace the number of people dying. Immigrants coming to the United States tend to be younger and in their childbearing years. They also tend to reproduce at slightly higher rates than American natives and at much higher rates than the populations of other superpowers, Passel said. The net effect of the United States’ relatively high immigration rate is to raise the fertility rate beyond replacement levels. "We are not facing the kind of demographic deficits that some of the European and Asian countries are facing as a result of low fertility and little immigration," Passel said. "These countries have to devote a substantial share of resources to supporting the elderly." That said, relatively high immigration brings its own downside as well, Passel said. "The long-term projections show that immigrants don’t magically save Social Security," he said. "The issue there is the immigrants eventually get old, too. At least in the short to medium term, having immigrants come into the country adds to the workforce and Social Security collections, but it also adds to the obligations in the long term." Our ruling Obama said, "We are younger than our competitors, and this is entirely because of immigration." The United States is considerably younger than key European countries and Japan, but its age structure is largely similar to China and Russia. Brazil and India, which are best described as emerging but still developing competitors, have substantially younger populations. His main point — that immigration is driving America’s relative youth — is largely accurate. The United States is home to more immigrants than any other country, and many of them are younger and reproduce at higher rates than do native-born Americans. Without its immigration levels, the U.S. would look much more like Europe in its age structure. The statement is accurate but needs additional information, so we rate the statement Mostly True.

pomt-02461	"Obamacare will mean 2.1 million fewer jobs by 2021."	half-true	/georgia/statements/2014/feb/24/americans-prosperity-georgia-chapter/details-reveal-distinction-obamacare-jobs-claim/	Opponents of the federal health care law recently got what they believe supports their argument that Congress should pull the plug on the legislation. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office projected that the law will push many Americans from the workforce. The Georgia chapter of Americans for Prosperity, a longtime critic of the law, held a rally at the state Capitol calling for the repeal of the controversial law, citing the CBO’s projections. "The Affordable Care Act has been disastrous for Georgians, causing premiums around the state to shoot up dramatically and causing many Georgians to lose their previous insurance. All this, despite the president’s promise that ‘if you like your plan, you can keep it,’" AFP Communications Director Joel Aaron Foster said. "The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office says Obamacare will mean 2.1 million fewer jobs by 2021." PolitiFact Georgia wondered whether the Georgia chapter was correct in its interpretation about the potential number of jobs lost as a result of the law. Our partners at PolitiFact in Washington had looked at a similar claim and found one major flaw. The National Republican Congressional Committee claimed in a television ad that "Nonpartisan government analysts say Obamacare will cost our economy up to 2.5 million jobs." PolitiFact noted that the CBO report did not use the word "jobs." "CBO’s updated estimate of the decrease in hours worked translates to a reduction in full-time-equivalent employment of about 2.0 million in 2017, rising to about 2.5 million in 2024, compared with what would have occurred in the absence of the ACA," the CBO report said. The CBO report suggested some people will choose to work fewer hours, others may quit their jobs in order to get health care subsidies they would not receive if they continued to work their regular schedule. "Because some people will reduce the amount of hours they work rather than stopping work altogether, the number who will choose to leave employment because of the ACA in 2024 is likely to be substantially less than 2.5 million," the CBO report said. PolitiFact noted: "An important distinction in the report is that labor force will reduce by the equivalent of 2.5 million full-time workers over the next decade. That doesn’t mean 2.5 million people will leave their jobs. Some people will only cut back a few hours or leave a second part-time job while others may stop working entirely." PolitiFact rated the National Republican Congressional Committee’s claim Mostly False. We contacted Americans for Prosperity Georgia to see whether there was any additional context it has that may show it should earn a better rating on the Truth-O-Meter. The group’s spokesman, Foster, said the chapter stands by its statement. He pointed to other news coverage that used the same terminology to describe the conclusion the CBO reached in its report. "The CBO report said the health care law will cause Americans to cut their work hours, equating to 2 million fewer jobs in 2017. That number is predicted to eventually rise to the equivalent of 2.5 million jobs in 2024," Politico reported. We found other prominent news outlets used similar language in their initial coverage. "Several million American workers will reduce their hours on the job or leave the workforce entirely because of incentives built into President Barack Obama's health care overhaul, the Congressional Budget Office said Tuesday," The Associated Press reported in an article that was published in The Atlanta Journal-Constitution. "That would mean losses equal to 2.3 million full-time jobs by 2021, in large part because people would opt to keep their income low to stay eligible for federal health care subsidies or Medicaid, the agency said. It had estimated previously that the law would lead to 800,000 fewer jobs by that year." Some major news outlets described it differently, sticking closer to the CBO’s description of its projection. The Washington Post’s Fact Checker, though, explained there is a difference. "[W]e should note that the figures (2 million, etc.) are shorthand for full-time equivalent workers — a combination of two conclusions: fewer people looking for work and some people choosing to work fewer hours. The CBO added those two things and produced a hard number, but it actually does not mean 2 million fewer workers," it reported. Our conclusion We debated long and hard about this one. Americans for Prosperity Georgia did capture the general theme of what the CBO tried to say about the impact of the health care law on employment. It will result in fewer people working fewer hours. But its terminology was not entirely accurate. The CBO report did not say the health care law would result in a reduction of 2.5 million jobs. It specifically said "more than 2.5 million people are likely to reduce the amount of labor they choose to supply to some degree" and added that "many of them will not leave the labor force entirely." We believe that is an important distinction. This claim does contain some element of truth, but some of the details are incorrect. We rate it Half True.

pomt-02191	"Over 300K home owner suicides attributed to foreclosures."	pants on fire!	/truth-o-meter/statements/2014/apr/25/facebook-posts/social-media-meme-says-300000-suicides-are-attribu/	A reader recently asked us to check a social media meme with a striking statistic about foreclosures and suicides. It said, "1.4 million homes stolen by banks since 2008. Over 300K home owner suicides attributed to foreclosures. Why won't anyone defend these American property owners' rights?" Have there really been 300,000 suicides linked to foreclosures? We decided to take a look. We first checked with the group credited with creating the meme -- a news and opinion site called occupycorporatism.com -- but an email to the site’s general inbox was not returned. So we next checked annual death statistics from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The most recent report came out in December 2013, covering statistics for 2010. For 2010, CDC found that suicide was the 10th most common cause of death, with 38,364 cases. Here’s the number for the past nine years: Year Suicides 2010 38,364 2009 36,909 2008 36,035 2007 34,598 2006 33,300 2005 32,637 2004 32,439 2003 31,484 2002 31,655 Total, 2002-10 307,151 So the total number of suicides from 2002-10 is around 300,000. But for the meme to be correct, you’d have to believe that every single American suicide between 2002 and 2010 was caused by a foreclosure. Of course, that assumes there was a reliable way to measure this kind of causal effect. (The CDC reports don't address what caused a person to commit suicide.) And the meme is even further off-base it it intends to be referring only to suicides since 2008. We asked several experts whether the meme's claim was even remotely possible. "There is no basis for this claim," said Douglas Massey, a population-research professor at Princeton University. "It isn't plausible that every suicide over a nine-year period could be attributed to foreclosure," agreed Janet M. Currie, a Princeton University economist who, along with Erdal Tekin of Georgia State University, has studied the health impacts of the rising tide of foreclosures in the United States. Tekin expressed similar skepticism when contacted by PolitiFact. In their own research, Currie and Tekin found that a location with about 400 foreclosures in a year might see 24 more medical visits for mental health conditions, including suicide attempts. But that wouldn’t be enough to support the meme’s claim, Currie said. Our ruling The meme said that over 300,000 homeowner suicides are attributable to foreclosures. But that would mean every suicide over a nine-year period would have been caused by a foreclosure, and experts say that’s not credible. We rate the claim Pants on Fire.

pomt-15338	"The United States ranks second worst in income inequality across developed countries," after taxes and transfers.	mostly true	/virginia/statements/2015/jul/13/bobby-scott/bobby-scott-says-us-no-2-income-disparity-among-de/	U.S. Rep. Bobby Scott has long complained about the gap between rich and poor in the United States. "When measuring income inequality across the globe, after accounting for taxes and transfers, the United States ranks second worst in income inequality across developed countries," Scott, D-3rd, wrote in a June 12 statement. Scott made the comment in explaining his vote against a sweeping trade agreement with Asian nations; he said thinks it would depress U.S. wages. The congressman has also cited income inequality in his calls to raise the minimum wage and increase taxes on the wealthy. We recently gave a Mostly True rating to his claim that U.S. income disparity is at it highest level since the 1920s. This time, we wondered whether Scott is right about the United States’ global ranking. DeMontre Boone, a legislative assistant to Scott, said the congressman drew his information from a December 2013 article by the Pew research Center headlined "Global Inequality: How the U.S. compares." Pew defined developed countries as those belonging to the Organization for Economic Development and Cooperation, a group of 34 democratic nations seeking to improve trade. The OECD calculates the inequality of income distribution in terms of what’s called a Gini coefficient that ranges on a scale from zero to one. Zero means there’s perfect equality and every household earns the same income. One means there’s absolute inequality and a single household earns a country’s entire income. All nations fall somewhere in between. The Pew article, drawing mostly on 2010 calculations, has a chart placing the U.S. 10th highest among OECD nations in income inequality measured before taxes and transfers -- payments such as welfare and Social Security that a government makes to people without an exchange of goods or services. The U.S. Gini rating was .499, well behind the leader, Ireland, who came in at .591. Scott, you’ll remember, focused his comments on earnings after tax and transfers. And when that bottom-line data was computed, the U.S. surged to No. 2 on the disparity chart, with a .38 Gini. Chile, with a .501 coefficient, had the greatest inequality. So Scott cited information in the Pew chart correctly. But two issues still arise: The OECD has updated its figures since the Pew article was published, and Pew omitted three OECD nations from its chart -- Mexico, Turkey and Hungary -- because, unlike the other countries, their Gini figures were unavailable for 2009 or 2010. So let’s look at this again, armed with data mostly from 2012 that includes all OECD nations. When it comes to income inequality before taxes and transfers, the U.S. ranked 7th. Here’s a list of those seven countries and the Gini coefficients: Ireland, .582 Greece, .569 Portugal, .536 Chile, .532 United Kingdom, .523 France, .518 United States, .513 Now, let’s examine income equality after taxes and transfers -- the core of Scott’s claim. The U.S. rose to fourth in the rankings here, suggesting that the redistributive effects of our tax and public welfare systems are weaker than some of our trading partners. Here’s the top four list: Chile, .503 Mexico, .457 Turkey, .402 United States, .390 Of course not all industrialized nations belong to the OECD. The trade organization also computed Russia’s income inequality for 2012 and the post-tax and transfers rating of .396 was higher than the United States’. If you’re wondering, the five OECD countries with the lowest post-tax and transfers income disparity -- all with a Gini around .250 -- were Estonia, the Slovak Republic, Slovenia, Norway and Finland. Our ruling Scott said, "The United States ranks second worst in income inequality across developed countries," after accounting for taxes and transfers. Scott bases his claim on an outdated chart listing the statistical disparity in 31 of the 34 OECD nations. Updated information with all the OECD nations shows the U.S. with the fourth highest disparity and it drops another notch if you include non-member Russia. Clearly, the U.S. ranks near the top among developed nations in income inequality, but not quite as high as Scott says. We rate his statement Mostly True.

pomt-03685	About 3 percent of Gov. Nathan Deal’s appointments have been African-American.	half-true	/georgia/statements/2013/apr/23/vincent-fort/few-blacks-picked-georgia-posts-lawmaker-says/	Before the Georgia Legislature ended its 2013 session last month, one senator took Gov. Nathan Deal to task for what the lawmaker said was a lack of racial diversity amongst appointees to various state boards and positions. "Less than 3 percent of appointees, since they’ve taken office, by the executive branch have been African-American," said Sen. Vincent Fort, an Atlanta Democrat who is African-American. Fort held a spreadsheet in his hand that he said documented the disparity. Just nine of some 200 appointments since Deal, who is white, was sworn in as governor in January 2011 were African-American, the senator said. Three of those African-Americans were appointed to the state’s Martin Luther King Jr. Commission, Fort said. "The point I’m trying to make is this," Fort told his Senate colleagues. "You see a lack of diversity in the appointments to government. That’s not right." About 30 percent of Georgians and the state’s registered voters are African-American, U.S. census figures and Georgia Secretary of State Office’s records show. PolitiFact Georgia wanted to know whether Fort’s claim was correct. It took us some time to do our own research, but we found African-Americans accounted for 7 percent of Deal’s appointments. Brian Robinson, the governor’s communications director, told PolitiFact Georgia that the governor’s office does not keep a breakdown of Deal’s appointments by race. Robinson said the governor wants racial diversity among his appointees. Robinson explained that anyone can apply to serve on a state board and applicants are not asked beforehand about their race. "The applicants do not report their race on the forms, though, and they don’t submit photos, so it would be difficult to guess the demographic breakdown of the governor’s appointees," Robinson said. Through a spokeswoman for Senate Democrats, Fort forwarded us the spreadsheet he cited on the Senate floor. It had 209 appointments, with the names of each person, the organization that person was appointed to, their race and gender, and where he or she lives. The spreadsheet had the race of all but eight appointees. PolitiFact Georgia, though, found Deal has made more than 800 appointments. The spokeswoman, Liz Flowers, explained the spreadsheet was based on a review of Deal’s executive orders. We looked through all of the governor’s news releases, which helped us to compile a more detailed list of Deal’s appointments. Deal, a former congressman from Gainesville, was elected with seemingly little support from African-American voters. Deal, a Republican, fared poorly in counties with large black populations in the 2010 general election against Democrat Roy Barnes. In Clayton County, where 72 percent of voters are black, Deal won 17 percent of the vote. In Dougherty County, where nearly 65 percent of registered voters are black, Deal won 30 percent of the vote. The Atlanta Journal-Constitution examined Deal’s appointments in May 2011, shortly after he took office. The findings: 83 of Deal’s 87 appointees -- 95 percent -- were white. Deal’s predecessor, Sonny Perdue, also a Republican, appointed whites at an 87 percent clip during his first year in office. In general, Georgia Republicans have had trouble gaining the support of black voters. In 2010, less than 3 percent of the state’s black voters cast ballots in the Republican primary, according to Emory University assistant political science professor Andra Gillespie. The professor cautioned that primary turnouts are typically low, so some black Republicans may have stayed home. She added that since Georgia has open primaries, some black voters who cast ballots in that primary may not typically side with the GOP. University of Georgia political science professor Charles Bullock estimated that 5 percent of black voters statewide cast their ballots for Deal. Flowers and some Democrats insist the lack of black support for Deal should not remove them from consideration for appointments. Some African-Americans on state boards told the AJC that they inquired about various positions even though they didn’t vote for the governor. Deal sought out others he knew and asked them to serve, the AJC reported. As the AJC did in 2011, PolitiFact Georgia used the AJC’s voter database, which comes from the Georgia Secretary of State’s Office, as the primary source for our research. The database lists each Georgia voter, giving his or her full name, race, date of birth, gender and address. We also conducted detailed Internet searches to match the names of some appointees. It took us more than two weeks to compile our research. Fort’s spreadsheet went from the beginning of Deal’s term to the end of February 2013. We looked at appointments up to the date Fort made his comments. There have been some appointments since March 26. We examined appointments Deal made to state boards, commissions, councils and judicial positions. The appointments range from the state Board of Public Safety to the Board of Hearing Aid Dealers and Dispensers. Many appointees were small business owners. Nearly 70 percent of them were men. We counted 53 appointees who live in Gainesville, Deal’s hometown. Atlanta was the only city with more appointees on our list. Thirty-seven people were appointed to more than one board. And how many were black? Sixty-one of the 843, according to our count, or slightly more than 7 percent. A handful listed their race as "other." Fourteen were listed as "unknown." A small number listed their race as Asian or Hispanic. The remainder, nearly 90 percent of them, were white. Robinson defended the governor’s efforts toward racial inclusiveness. "[M]any agency heads hired by Governor Deal are African-American, and the governor recently appointed the state’s first Asian-American woman judge to sit on the Court of Appeals," Robinson said. "The governor’s actions in the recent DeKalb County school case also provide a telling example. Our liaisons were a white man and a black man. Our nominating panel was majority African-American, and five of the six board members that he appointed are African-American." To sum up, Fort said during a Senate session that less than 3 percent of the governor’s appointees are African-American. Our research showed it’s slightly more than 7 percent. The senator’s overarching claim that Deal has appointed a relatively low percentage of minorities has merit. But he was wrong by a handful of percentage points. It was based on an incomplete sampling of Deal’s total appointees. We rate the claim Half True.	None	Vincent Fort	None	None	None	2013-04-23T06:00:00	2013-03-26	['Nathan_Deal', 'African_American']

pomt-06115	Says constitutional amendment would "help to stop unfair, double taxation on real estate."	half-true	/oregon/statements/2011/dec/30/Yes-on-79/are-oregon-home-sellers-really-subject-double-tax/	While we were trolling for some new facts to check, a rather urgent ad popped out at us on one of our favorite conservative websites: "Sign the Petition. Stop Unfair, Double Taxes," it read. The text was superimposed on a picture of a home with a "For Sale" sign. We were curious, so we clicked through. We landed on a website for Protect Oregon Homes. There, the same pitch continued in earnest. We were greeted with a picture of a home for sale. "Sold -- with double tax!" read the sign out front. On the side of the page was a calculator that helps visitors compute their property transfer tax. It was preset at just under 2 percent of the sales price. "Sign the Petition! We need your help to stop unfair, double taxation on real estate," is the first bit of text on the site, referring to a push for a constitutional ban on real estate transfer taxes. Wow, we thought. Do we really have a double tax on real estate? We decided to check. The taxation that the site is looking to "stop" would kick into effect when a home swaps hands. Protect Oregon Homes, backed by the Oregon Association of Realtors, is looking to amend the state constitution to bar "state/local governments from imposing taxes, fees, assessments on transfer of any interest in real property." There’s just one problem. When we looked a little further, we found out that there is only one such tax in the entire state (Washington County imposes a 0.1 percent transfer tax) and this proposed legislation would grandfather that charge in, just as previous legislation did. What’s more, beside that one-time Washington County exception, under current law, cities, counties and other jurisdictions don’t have the power to impose taxes on real estate transfers. So what gives? What would an amendment be stopping? Shaun Jillions, a spokesperson for Oregon Association of Realtors, explains it this way: "There's nothing in that (current) statute that stops the state Legislature from" instituting one or repealing the current ban. His line was pretty close to the one featured on the group’s website: The "state Legislature has the authority, subject to governor approval, to impose such taxes and fees or to change current statutory law," the site says. "Local officials would welcome any source of new revenue to keep their operations going. A new revenue stream from a tax on property sales would be very tempting ... We need a law to take this law off the table. Forever." Essentially, this is all about a strong defense being the best offense. The website even says so: "During the past five legislative sessions, there have been nine attempts to authorize such a tax at the state or local level." Jillions mentioned that same fact and even followed up a with a list of of the bills Realtors had been tracking. A single bill was introduced in the 2011 session but died without a hearing. The same happened to three bills during the 2009 session. In 2007, a bill that would open up the doors to transfer taxes did get multiple hearings, but it failed, too. Two bills in 2005 died without hearings and in 2003 two bills were introduced, only one got a single hearing, and both ultimately died. We asked Jillions about the poor showing most of these bills made. Did it seem a little disingenuous to say that there’s a double tax when there’s a law banning such charges and the bills put forward to end that ban have been largely dead on arrival? "That might have something to do with the lobbying efforts of the Oregon Association of Realtors," he said. We went one step further to gauge the Legislature’s interest in repealing the current ban and talked to Sen. Ginny Burdick, one of the chairs of the Revenue Committee. "I've not heard any push to do this in February, " she said, referring to the next time the Legislature meets. "It's certainly not on my priority list. "I don't see this coming up in the near future, but with the budget problems we have any revenue source can and should be on the table." Jillions also pointed to the fact that Multnomah County Commissioner Deborah Kafoury has been bullish about such a tax. Indeed, she sponsored a bill to overturn the ban back in 2003 when she was a state lawmaker. Most recently, she told Willamette Week that "putting a pre-emption into the constitution is really tying the hands of local voters. It’s already state law, and I don’t see why that’s not good enough." Finally, Jillions told us to take a look at a report issued in June 2008 by the governor’s Task Force on Federal Forest Payments and County Services. In the report, there’s a suggestion that the state drop its pre-emption of real estate transfer taxes. But that was issued years ago and we’re no closer to passing legislation of that nature now than we were then. Even with the report, the noncommittal statements from Burdick and a possible interest from one county commissioner, it doesn’t seem like a transfer tax is imminent, let alone even in existence. The Protect Oregon Homes website says signing the petition will "help to stop unfair, double taxation on real estate" when, in fact, there is only one such tax in Oregon and the repeal they’re floating would do nothing to end it. What’s more, a repeal of the current pre-emption, while certainly possible, is not something that the Legislature appears to be actively considering. Protect Oregon Homes acknowledges some of these points on their website, which tempers our ruling somewhat, but the general feeling you get from the group is that there’s a tax on the books -- or there will be soon -- and only a constitutional amendment will stop it. In fact, there is no double tax to stop. We give the group a Half True for this claim -- it’s partially accurate but leaves out some essential context.

pomt-07992	Says Ohio Attorney General Mike DeWine is hypocritical for challenging the constitutionality of the new health care law.	false	/ohio/statements/2011/jan/17/ohio-alliance-retired-americans/attack-dewines-health-reform-position-voluntarily-/	Wasting no time, new Ohio Attorney General Mike DeWine made good on his campaign pledge to challenge the 2010 federal health care law as unconstitutional. DeWine, a Republican, notified Florida Attorney General Pamela Jo Bondi on Jan. 10 that he would join 20 other states that have already signed on to try to invalidate the Affordable Care Act in U.S. District Court in Florida. The gist of the lawsuit, as DeWine explained in a news release: "The federal government simply does not have the right to force someone to buy a product -- be it health insurance or any other type of goods or services that an individual may or may not want -- or face a penalty." Under the Affordable Care Act, that requirement to buy health insurance would begin in 2014. Critics pounced, their reactions as predictable as DeWine’s. But one group in particular, the labor union-affiliated Ohio Alliance for Retired Americans, drew our attention when it said in a news release that DeWine’s first act as state attorney general was "at odds" with his actions as a U.S. senator. When we called to learn more about this claim, Norman Wernet, field organizer for the group, told us that DeWine was being "not only a little illogical but also hypocritical." That’s because as a senator, DeWine in 2003 supported a bill that added prescription drug coverage to Medicare, the federal government’s health program for seniors. Seniors would have to buy this coverage to participate, starting in 2006, and the law had a penalty for not buying drug coverage when eligible, said the alliance. It was a "mandate" no different from the new one requiring all Americans to get health insurance or face a fine, according to the alliance’s news release and our interview with Wernet. "It appears that what was constitutional to Senator DeWine in 2003 is no longer so," said the news release, going on to criticize the Medicare prescription drug law for additional reasons only tangentially related to the claim of constitutional hypocrisy. "This pang of conscience seems to us to be more political theatrics than sound use of Ohio’s time and money." We are not going to debate whether either of these laws is good or bad or whom they benefit. And far be it from us to argue the hotly debated question of whether the mandate to buy health care insurance or face penalties flies in the face of the Constitution. Federal courts will settle that. Instead, we have a more basic question to settle, because the alliance’s claim was news to us. We did not know that the 2003 Medicare prescription drug law had a mandate: Buy drug coverage (it is known as Medicare Part D) or else be penalized. As it turns out, neither did the groups with whom we checked. It needs to be noted that these sources, including the nonpartisan Kaiser Family Foundation, which analyzes health policy, do not wish to engage in political debate. They have no beef with DeWine or the Ohio Alliance for Retired Americans. But they referred us to their analyses, and to fact sheets from the federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, or CMS, that described the Medicare prescription drug coverage as voluntary. That word -- voluntary -- shows up repeatedly. We read the 2003 bill itself, too, which could not say it more clearly, because the section establishing the drug program has this title: ‘‘PART D—VOLUNTARY PRESCRIPTION DRUG BENEFIT PROGRAM." We read the description of the program published by the pharmacy school of the University of California at San Francisco, which said: "It is voluntary." Finally, we asked CMS directly: Is enrollment mandatory or voluntary? CMS spokesman Tony Salters said, "Voluntary is correct." With so many people and publications saying the program is voluntary, how then, could the Ohio Alliance for Retired Americans see it so differently? As Wernet explains his group’s take, everyone who is 65 or over and retired must either get into a Medicare Part D plan or have similar drug coverage, such as from the Department of Veterans Affairs or through a retiree health plan. Otherwise, they must pay a penalty when joining later. That penalty amounts to 1 percent of the cost of a drug policy for each month the enrollee has delayed since he or she was eligible, and it is added to the monthly premium the senior will pay. Yes, we asked, but can’t a retiree delay enrolling indefinitely and therefore never face a fine? What about wealthy seniors who don’t care about reducing their prescription costs (seniors with low incomes may qualify for subsidies to pay for Part D coverage), or healthy seniors who don’t have high drug costs or need a prescription policies? What about independent-minded people who just don’t want any part of this government-created health care system? Here is where the interpretations of "voluntary" diverge. Wernet said that eventually, the need for prescriptions and the financial pinch of paying for them catches up with people. So in reality, just about everyone winds up with some kind of coverage. Yet those who don’t sign up quickly, perhaps trying to "game" the system by waiting (and saving on premiums), get hit with the penalty. It is the same principle as in the new health care law, he said: You can try to avoid getting health care coverage until you get sick and decide you need it, but you’re going to pay a penalty. One penalty -- written in the 2010 health insurance law -- will kick in quickly once that provision takes effect, while other -- from the 2003 Medicare prescription law -- kicks in when seniors finally decide to enroll. The timing is different but the principle, he said, is the same. "To us, it seems to be a distinction without a difference," Wernet said. "What Congress said in 2003 is no different than what Congress said in 2010: You can’t game the system." We see a significant difference, however. The 2003 law that DeWine backed did not have a mandate. If you want to roll the dice when you retire, Congress said you certainly may. You’ll pay a penalty for delaying if you change your mind, but you are free not to change your mind. You have that choice -- and about 4.7 million people, or 10 percent of Medicare beneficiaries, have made that choice, according to CMS figures cited by the Kaiser Family Foundation. Not a one of them is paying a fine. In other words, DeWine is not being hypocritical in challenging the 2010 health insurance mandate, because when he voted in 2003 for the prescription insurance program, he was not supporting a mandate. That’s why we rate the Alliance for Retired Americans’ claim False.	None	Ohio Alliance for Retired Americans	None	None	None	2011-01-17T06:00:00	2011-01-10	['None']
pomt-10786	"This (SCHIP) is socialized medicine. It is going to go to families that make $60,000 a year. Those aren't poor children."	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2007/oct/15/duncan-hunter/hunter-schip-estimate-on-target/	Hunter contends that the bipartisan legislation to expand the State Children's Health Insurance Program, vetoed by President Bush on Oct. 3, 2007, is socialized medicine and would allow families earning $60,000 a year to enroll. The socialized part is a bit of overstatement that we won't bother with here. But Hunter is correct—under certain circumstances—about the $60,000 figure. The legislation that would expand the SCHIP program, which sends federal money to states to cover health insurance for children in low-income households, would cover families with incomes up to 300 percent of the federal poverty line. For a single parent with two children, that would be $51,510 a year. For a family of four it would be $61,950. And, it is possible that families making more money could be covered. In Title 1 Section 114, the SCHIP legislation says states could, if they meet new requirements, be allowed to expand eligibility higher than 300 percent of the federal poverty line. But to do that, states would have to show that they are covering a "target" percentage of children with family incomes below 200 percent before they could go beyond that group.

pomt-10342	"I have a perfect voting record from organizations like the Veterans of Foreign Wars, the American Legion and all the other veterans service organizations."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/jul/17/john-mccain/not-perfect-with-all-the-veterans/	Sen. John McCain isn't used to criticism about his support for veterans. After all, he spent five years in a Vietnamese prison camp and has staked his presidential campaign on a pledge to carry on the Iraq war. But of late, McCain has taken heat from antiwar veterans groups such as VoteVets.org for hedging his support for legislation to expand federal funding to help veterans go to college and then for failing to show up for the Senate vote on a supplemental war spending bill that secured passage of the expanded GI Bill benefits last month. So when a man confronted McCain during a July 7, 2008, town hall meeting — accusing the Arizona senator of speaking out against the GI bill — McCain got testy. McCain responded that he hadn't opposed the enhanced educational benefits in the GI bill but wanted to ensure that they didn't stand in the way of the military securing re-enlistments. He said he and his allies successfully lobbied the bill's chief sponsor, Jim Webb of Virginia, to include a provision allowing a soldier who wanted to continue his military service to give his educational benefits to a family member. All that was true. But then McCain took it too far. "The reason why I have a perfect voting record from organizations like the Veterans of Foreign Wars, the American Legion and all the other veterans service organizations is because of my support of them," he said. To be sure, the VFW and the Legion have given McCain awards in the past and can be fairly described as McCain supporters. The VFW's political action committee has endorsed him for re-election to his Senate seat and to his House seat before that, but neither group keeps a voting scorecard. At the same time, another veterans service organization cited by the McCain critic at the town hall meeting — the Disabled American Veterans — gave McCain only a 20 percent grade in its 2007 voting scorecard. McCain voted for only one of the amendments that the group tallied as key votes, while voting against the other four. Likewise, the Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America, a relatively new group that was instrumental in pushing for the expanded GI Bill, says McCain only voted veterans' way on 58 percent of the 155 Senate votes it tallied between 2001 and 2006. Even the Vietnam Veterans of America reports that McCain has voted against 15 of 31 priority bills it tracked between 2001 and 2008. As a result, we find McCain's claim to be False.

pomt-14018	Florida has "issued more than 3 million conceal carry permits in the past 30 years. Only 168 have been revoked."	half-true	/florida/statements/2016/jun/02/donald-trump/donald-trump-minimizes-number-revoked-gun-permits-/	Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton continued their battle over gun rights following his recent endorsement by the National Rifle Association. Trump told the NRA that Clinton wants to abolish the Second Amendment (she doesn’t) while Clinton said that Trump wants to allow guns in schools (he has promised to get rid of gun-free zones). But Trump says Clinton’s positions are misguided because gun permit holders follow the law — and that includes Florida, where he says only a tiny speck have lost the right to a gun permit. "These are among the most law-abiding folks statistically in the entire country," Trump said. "In Florida, for example, they have issued more than 3 million conceal carry permits in the past 30 years. Only 168 have been revoked. That's 0.006 percent." Trump’s statement isn’t exactly right because he is only citing a certain category of revocations. A Trump spokeswoman didn’t respond for this fact-check. Number of Florida revocations Florida’s concealed weapon permit program started in 1987. Florida is a "shall issue" state, which means it's easier to get a gun permit here than in some other states, and Florida also grants permits to out-of-state residents. As Trump said, 3 million permits had been issued in Florida over the last three decades -- 3.1 million, to be more exact. As of April, about 1.6 million people in Florida currently have the permits. But Trump got his facts wrong about revocations, because he only cited a slice of them. Between October 1987 and April 2016, Florida revoked 10,841 concealed weapon or firearm license permits, according to a summary provided by the state’s division of licensing within the Florida Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services. The 168 figure that Trump cited is the number of those revoked for misuse of a firearm. There are various reasons that someone can have his or her gun permit revoked, according to state law. That includes permit holders who are convicted of certain crimes including felonies, those convicted of disorderly intoxication three times in a year, those committed to a mental institution, or those who due to physical problems can no longer safely use a gun. In 2011, the state stopped providing a breakdown for the reasons that permits have been revoked and by law now only track the number of revocations. What experts say about the revocations Revocation data alone doesn’t tell the full story about whether nearly all gun permit holders are law-abiding. In 2006, the state Legislature made the names of gun permit holders private, making it difficult for the public or journalists to examine whether there are questionable permit holders. That means we found little research about the topic in Florida, and much of it outdated. A Sun Sentinel investigation of those licensed to carry guns in the first half of 2006 found that permit holders included: More than 1,400 people who pleaded guilty or no contest to felonies but qualified because of a loophole in the law that allows them to carry guns three years after they complete their sentences if a judge withheld adjudication; 216 people with outstanding warrants, including a Tampa pizza delivery man wanted in the fatal shooting of a teenager over a stolen order of chicken wings; 28 people with active domestic-violence injunctions against them; and, Six registered sex offenders. The low number of revocations isn’t a surprise because the applicants had to meet criteria to get the permit in the first place, some experts said. "Revocations are relatively rare largely because the permit-holder population was already ‘pre-selected’ to be relatively law-abiding by virtue of the requirement that applicants pass a background check to get a permit in the first place," said Gary Kleck, a criminologist at Florida State University. Daniel Webster, director of the Johns Hopkins Center for Gun Policy & Research, said that, as a group, concealed-carry permit holders have a below average rate of arrests and convictions. "But the policy question is are Florida and the other states who have made it so easy for nearly anyone to legally carry a loaded gun in public safer as a result? The research indicates that they are not," Webster said. "The best-case scenario is that these laws don’t affect violent crime, but the most rigorous research on the subject indicates that when states expand concealed carry of firearms, assaults with guns increase." Our ruling Trump said Florida has "issued more than 3 million conceal carry permits in the past 30 years. Only 168 have been revoked." Trump cited the number of permits issued since 1987 but exaggerated how few had been revoked. Florida revoked 10,841 permits, including 168 for misuse of a firearm. We don’t know the full picture about who has a gun permit -- or had it revoked -- because the identities of permit holders in Florida are private.

pomt-12086	Says Adam Sandler said "Mormons are some of the most decent people I’ve ever come across."	false	/punditfact/statements/2017/aug/29/blog-posting/fake-news-sites-say-celebrities-praise-mormons-quo/	A laundry list of fake news sites have posted a story claiming Adam Sandler praised Mormons in a podcast, but there’s no evidence the actor ever made the statements. The post, which we first saw on WRPM33.com on Aug. 23, 2017, ran under the headline, "What Adam Sandler is saying about Mormons." Facebook users flagged this post and several others on different websites as being potentially fabricated, as part of the social network’s efforts to fight fake news. It’s nothing bad: The post actually says he found them to be exceptionally nice people. It’s just that we can’t find any evidence that Sandler actually said any of it. The post said Sandler was on an unnamed podcast when the atheist host began to disparage religion in general and Mormons in particular. Sandler, who grew up in a Jewish family, spoke up to defend the faith. "I don’t know, Tom. I don’t think I’ve ever had a reason to say anything negative about Mormons. I mean, I know you’re just having some fun here but — from my experience — Mormons are some of the most decent people I’ve ever come across," the story attributed to Sandler. He said more in the post, but they aren’t real quotes. Apart from there being a parody out there of his Hanukkah Song adapted for Mormons, we really couldn’t find him making much of any comment about Mormons at all. But that’s because WRPM33.com and scads of other sites are posting a made-up story. "Most of the articles on wrpm33.com are works of fantasy or satire and are not true," the site’s disclaimer said. The sites use domain names that sound like official media outlets, but don’t contain any apparent contact information. These are the same kinds of websites responsible for other stories we’ve looked at that claim celebrities have said or done things they haven’t. One popular story said that a celebrity made nice comments about the residents of a town after car trouble. Another post claimed that a celebrity enjoyed a town so much, they are moving there. In both cases, the name of the town and celebrity can change, with the bulk of the story staying the same. There’s even another subset of links telling readers that a Star Wars movie will be filming near their city. The object is clearly to get residents of the town named to click on the link, to earn advertising revenue for the (unidentified) owners of the site. We’ve already seen another version of this story that attributed the same quotes to Matthew McConaughey. More are sure to come. Be aware that links you see about celebrity news may be fabricated, especially if they mention a smaller location. It’s a friendly sentiment, but Sandler didn’t say these things.

pomt-10195	McCain "voted to cut education funding, against accountability standards. He even proposed abolishing the Department of Education."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/sep/17/barack-obama/cherry-picking-the-record/	It's been nearly 50 years since a sitting senator, John F. Kennedy, has won the presidency, and Barack Obama's recent TV ad assailing John McCain's education record is a good example why. Senators, especially those with long tenures like McCain, have to take a lot of votes and state a lot of positions, all of which can later be used against them – even if the bulk of the senator's record points to a different conclusion than the attacker's. That's certainly the case with Obama's ad, which claims, among other things, that McCain "voted to cut education funding, against accountability standards. He even proposed abolishing the Department of Education." In each case, there's an example or two bolstering Obama's claims, but there are other examples in McCain's nearly 22 years in the Senate, more telling, that show that McCain generally supports increased funding for education, stronger accountability standards and a more powerful Education Department. On the first point, the Obama campaign cites a number of examples where McCain didn't support large increases in education funding backed by Democrats, but only one case in which McCain actually "voted to cut education funding," as the ad alleges. It came in 1995, when McCain voted for a Republican budget resolution calling for a 1 percent cut in the education budget. In the end, the Education Department's budget was cut slightly that year — in the midst of the budget wars pitting then-President Clinton against the new Republican majority in Congress. But the education budget quickly rebounded and McCain in 2001 voted for the law known as the No Child Left Behind Act, which increased federal education funding by a whopping 33 percent, or $14-billion, in a single year. The McCain campaign in response to the ad's allegations noted a number of other occasions in which McCain has supported increased education funding. It's true that Democrats have supported large funding increases beyond what Republicans have backed, but the Education Department budget today is still 60 percent higher than when Bush took office, increases that have largely enjoyed McCain's backing. Obama again cherry picks the record to make a case that McCain opposes accountability standards. The Obama campaign cites a number of pre-No Child Left Behind votes in which McCain didn't support Democratic efforts to require states to establish accountability standards as a condition of federal funding. Many Republicans long opposed such conditions as a federal imposition on what is traditionally a state responsibility: education. It wasn't accountability standards that they opposed, rather federal intrusion into state responsibilities. Even so, when Bush proposed just that idea in 2001, Republicans, including McCain, voted to create the most rigorous education accountability standards ever imposed by the federal government on the states through the No Child Left Behind Act. Given the McCain campaign's pledge to fully fund the No Child Left Behind Act, and in that way endorse the expanded federal role in education that law calls for, it seems unlikely McCain has any intention of abolishing the Department of Education should he be elected. But for what it's worth, he did way back in 1994, when he said on CNN's Late Edition that "given the origins of the Department of Education, I would favor doing away with it." There's evidence, then, for each of Obama's charges, but entirely absent is the larger context. Obama is citing exceptions in the McCain record rather than the rule, and claims — erroneously — that failing to support the large increases in education funding backed by Democrats is the same as supporting cuts. As a result, we find the Obama campaign ad's claims to be Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.	None	Barack Obama	None	None	None	2008-09-17T00:00:00	2008-09-09	['None']

pomt-03332	"The FL Guard has defended our freedom in Afghanistan, Iraq, and put their lives at risk; now the fed govt is going to cut their pay 20%."	half-true	/florida/statements/2013/jul/23/rick-scott/florida-national-guard-members-fought-overseas-now/	We’ll start with this fact: Gov. Rick Scott hearts the Florida National Guard. But as Scott lambasts the impact of federal budget cuts on the Guard, is he telling the truth? "The FL Guard has defended our freedom in Afghanistan, Iraq, and put their lives at risk; now the fed govt is going to cut their pay 20%" Scott said on Twitter July 16. Those are some fighting words about the automatic spending cuts known as sequestration. Are Florida Guard members who fought overseas now getting their pay slashed by 20 percent? Scott’s office directed us to the Florida National Guard for answers. We will draw from information from the Guard and U.S. Defense Department, as well as our previous fact-check stemming from a feud between Scott, a Republican, and Sen. Bill Nelson, a Democrat, about the impact of sequestration on the Florida National Guard during a hurricane. Who exactly is getting furloughed The pay cut Scott mentioned refers to 11 furlough days for some members of the National Guard between July and September. That translates to a 20 percent cut in take-home pay during that time period -- not the entire year, said Lt. Col. James Evans, a Florida National Guard spokesman. About 966 employees in Florida face furloughs. (The precise number changes frequently due to new hires and those leaving the workforce.) The vast majority -- more than 900 -- are uniformed military technicians, also known as dual-status military technicians. The Miami Herald recently reported on their specific duties: "They are Guard members known as technicians, who draw their wages from federal funds in a range of jobs — from mechanics who maintain armored vehicles to public affairs specialists who write articles. While most Guard members are part-timers when not deployed, the nearly 1,000 so-called technicians are full-time federal civil service employees. Most work in northeastern Florida." Evans described the technicians as "the uniformed day-to-day backbone of our full-time force" and pointed out they are the only "troops in the Department of Defense that are NOT exempt from furlough under Sequestration." The Florida National Guard has 12,000 members. About 10,000 are those who train one weekend a month plus two weeks a year and hold outside jobs. These Guard members are not federal employees and don’t face furloughs, Evans said. Of the remaining 2,000 who work for the Guard year round, half are active guard and reserves -- such as those who patrol the airfield at Homestead in South Florida -- and don’t face furloughs. The other half include the military technicians and civilians who are paid from an account subject to furloughs. So we could say that about 8 percent of the Florida National Guard (966 of 12,000) face furloughs or, like Scott, we could say half of the state’s full-time force face furloughs. "If their unit goes to war, they go to war with them. They are a military member," Florida Guard legislative director Lt. Col. (Ret.) Glenn Sutphin told PolitiFact Florida. So how many of the furloughed guard members have fought in Iraq or Afghanistan? Of the employees taking furloughs, about 40 percent, or 385, have deployed since Sept. 11, Evans said. That includes 57 uniformed military technicians currently deployed around the world. Since the Sept. 11 attacks, more than 700 uniformed military technicians in Florida have been deployed, he said, many of them multiple times. Of the 18 Florida guard members who have died supporting an overseas federal mission, two were technicians on active duty orders. Our ruling Scott said "The FL Guard has defended our freedom in Afghanistan, Iraq, and put their lives at risk; now the fed govt is going to cut their pay 20%." Scott’s statement isn’t telling the whole story. A reader could falsely assume the entire Florida Guard is furloughed. But the furloughs only affect about 8 percent of the overall Florida National Guard, or about half of the full-time force. Also, the 20 percent pay cut is not annual or permanent; they are losing that amount for one-third of the year. Additionally, not every furloughed civilian employee has served in Afghanistan or Iraq. Among the 966 guard members being furloughed, about 40 percent have been deployed. Scott’s claim contains some elements of truth: Many Guard members have risked their lives in overseas deployments and now some face pay cuts for part of the year. But the details that Scott omitted are important for understanding the full effect of the furloughs. We rate this claim Half True.

pomt-03372	"There was a Gallup poll in Egypt last year, and 70 percent of Egyptians don't want our money."	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2013/jul/11/rand-paul/rand-paul-says-gallup-poll-found-70-percent-egypti/	The Egyptian military’s ouster of President Mohammed Morsi amid major anti-government protests has prompted some American politicians to urge the U.S. to hold back some or all of the roughly $1.5 billion in aid it gives annually to Egypt. Those who support an aid cutoff argue that despite the popular uprising, the military’s removal of a democratically elected leader undermines democracy, requiring a negative response from the U.S. Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., went a step further, arguing that Egyptians don’t even want the aid we give their country in the first place. (Paul is a longtime critic of foreign aid in general.) In a Fox News interview on July 8, 2013, host Eric Bolling asked Paul why President Barack Obama hadn’t called the ouster a "coup." Paul responded, "You know, I think they are confused on this. They, like so many supporters of foreign aid, think that that's how we buy friendship around the world, that's how we influence people. But the interesting thing is, there was a Gallup poll in Egypt last year, and 70 percent of Egyptians don't want our money. So, they burn our flag, they don't want our money and we say, ‘Oh, here, you must take it, or we want you to behave and act like Americans.’ But there isn't a whole lot of real democracy going on over there." We wondered whether Paul was right about the high level of public opposition to U.S. assistance in Egypt. The answer is that Paul is right. In fact, the opposition to aid is even more widespread among Egyptians than he had indicated. In a February 2012 poll, Gallup asked Egyptians, "Do you favor or oppose the U.S. sending economic aid to Egypt?" Gallup pollsters found that 82 percent opposed such aid. That was the highest level of opposition recorded in six Gallup polls between April 2011 and February 2012. Even the lowest level of opposition found in these polls -- 52 percent in April 2011 -- meant that a majority opposed U.S. aid. So it’s a stance that seems pretty widespread in Egypt in recent years. In a September 2012 analysis of its survey results, Gallup wrote that "Egyptians may resent U.S. aid for the same reason some members of Congress are calling it into question -- it is seen as a tool of U.S. influence with Egypt's government." The attitudes Gallup found are mirrored in Pew poll data from spring 2013. Pew asked Egyptians, "Overall, would you say U.S. economic aid to Egypt is having a mostly positive impact, a mostly negative impact, or no impact on the way things are going in Egypt?" Overall, 24 percent of respondents said "mostly positive," 55 percent said "mostly negative" and 18 percent said "no impact." When the wording of the question was varied to say "military" aid rather than "economic" aid, attitudes turned even more negative. Ten percent of respondents said "mostly positive," 58 percent said "mostly negative" and 28 percent said "no impact." These findings rang true with experts we contacted. "There is no doubt that there are large numbers of Egyptians who don’t want our aid," said Steven A. Cook, a senior fellow for Middle Eastern studies at the Council on Foreign Relations. While Paul’s claim is accurate, there’s one thing worth noting. The polls Gallup (and Pew) conducted did not use the familiar telephone-based random sampling technique most commonly seen in the United States. The Gallup poll used face-to-face interviews conducted in Arabic with 1,000 adults age 15 and older. Gallup has explained that face-to-face surveys are "normally conducted … by dividing a given population into blocks of roughly equal population density. Each block is further divided into blocks until a single household is chosen at random, and then a single respondent is randomly chosen from the household." The use of this methodology doesn’t mean such polls aren’t trustworthy -- if U.S.-style telephone methods had been workable in Egypt, Gallup could have used them -- but the approach is so different that we think it’s a point worth noting. According to Gallup, the margin of sampling error for the April 2012 survey was 3 percentage points, though the company also acknowledges that "question wording and practical difficulties in conducting surveys can introduce error or bias into the findings of public opinion polls." Pew, for its part, makes clear that security concerns for pollsters made it impossible to include about 2 percent of the population that lives in "frontier" regions. Our ruling Paul said, "There was a Gallup poll in Egypt last year, and 70 percent of Egyptians don't want our money." That actually understates what Gallup found. One of the firm’s polls from April 2012 found that 82 percent of Egyptians opposed such aid. Other polls and regional experts confirm the existence of such levels of opposition.

pomt-11939	"One in 10 babies born in this country is born in Texas."	true	/texas/statements/2017/oct/12/joyce-mauk/fort-worth-pediatrician-says-1-10-us-born-babies-b/	A Fort Worth pediatrician who supports continued federal backing of health insurance for children of the working poor suggested it’s an important issue in these parts because 10 percent of Americans start as Texans. In October 2017, Joyce Mauk, president of the Texas Pediatric Society, was quoted by the Austin American-Statesman as saying: "One in 10 babies born in this country is born in Texas, and so it affects us disproportionately if access to health care is compromised for children. There is nothing good you can say about taking away access to health care for children." At the time, Congress had failed to extend its authorization of the Children’s Health Insurance Program before federal funding expired at the end of September. Without further action, about 400,000 Texas children and pregnant women were believed to be at risk of losing coverage by early 2018. We wondered about the share of U.S.-born babies birthed in Texas. By phone, Mauk told us she relied on statistics compiled from U.S. states by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention showing that 403,618 Texas births accounted for 10 percent of 3,980,000 births nationally in 2015. We were shortly able to confirm that number, thanks to a January 2017 CDC report tabulating U.S. births. It showed 403,618 Texas births in 2015 made up 10.1 percent of 3,978,497 births nationally. Among the states, the chart shows, only California accounted for a greater share; 491,478 births there accounted for 12.4 percent of U.S. births. Next, we asked the CDC and the Texas Demographic Center, based at the University of Texas at San Antonio, about more recent data and figures giving historical perspective. By email, CDC spokesman Brian Tsai pointed us to bureau-posted 2016 birth counts by state, posted in September 2017, showing that the 406,945 births in Texas that year accounted for 10.3 percent of 3,956,112 births nationally. So, the 1-in-10 figure still holds up. In Texas, to our emailed queries, Lila Valencia of the demographic center provided a chart showing that Texas-born babies have comprised 1 in 10 U.S. births since 2008. From 1960 through 1971, the chart indicates, Texas-born babies made up 6 percent of U.S.-born babies. That share, the chart shows, was 7 percent from 1972 through 1979; 8 percent from 1980 through 1995; and 9 percent from 1996 through 2007. Of late, Valencia elaborated, "the Texas share of births has been steadily increasing, even following drops in the number of births following the Great Recession," Valencia wrote, adding: "If current total fertility rates and the child-bearing age distribution of women in each state remains the same, we would anticipate the Texas share of births to continue to increase given the younger age distribution of the state, its larger Hispanic share of the population, and its significant population growth relative to other states." Our ruling Mauk said 1 in 10 U.S.-born babies is born in Texas. According to government tallies, that’s been so since 2008. We rate this claim True.

pomt-09512	"My opponent... lost 43,000 jobs in Houston since he took over; we are losing jobs."	false	/texas/statements/2010/feb/18/farouk-shami/shami-said-houston-lost-43000-jobs-while-white-was/	Farouk Shami, the Houston businessman running for governor, has guaranteed a job to every working-age Texan if he's elected. He even said he'd pay the state, ahem, $10 million if he hasn't created 100,000 jobs during his first two years in office. Former Houston mayor Bill White, running against Shami, also trumpets his job record. But Shami suggests that voters can't expect as much from his opponent, arguing that Houston lost jobs during the White administration. "My capability and my experience is to create jobs, unlike my opponent, who... lost 43,000 in Houston since he took over," Shami said during the Feb. 8 Democratic primary debate. "We are losing jobs." Indeed? We decided to check the facts. Kelly Johnson, Shami's former communications director (she resigned with four other campaign staffers Feb. 17), said he was citing the change in the number of unemployed people in Harris County from January 2004, when White was sworn in as mayor, to December 2009, White's last month in office. Johnson said they used county data, which is not seasonally adjusted, because the Texas Workforce Commission's available numbers for the city didn't date to the beginning of White's tenure. Using the same data, we calculated that after six years, 42,325 more people were unemployed in Harris County than when White took office. But that doesn't mean Houston lost 42,325 jobs. Cheryl Abbot, a regional economist at the Bureau of Labor Statistics, advised us that unemployment data is used to track how many people are out of work, but it's not the right way to determine how many jobs have been gained or lost. Because a working person can have more than one job — and can lose a job but remain partially employed — the number of workers does not equal the number of jobs. To gauge how many actual jobs are on the books, Abbot directed us to nonfarm wage and salary employment numbers. The Texas Workforce Commission doesn't track that data by county, but by metropolitan area. We found that the Houston-Sugar Land-Baytown area gained 278,700 jobs between the month White took office and December 2009, when he left. Johnson said Shami's campaign didn't use the raw number of nonfarm jobs gained or lost because that approach doesn't take into account population growth over time. Houston's population surged by nearly 288,600 between 2000 and 2008, according to the U.S. Census Bureau — and some of those folks did not have jobs. "The population massively grew when White was mayor, so it's far more accurate to look (at) an unemployment rate (or the) number of people unemployed from when he took office to when he left," she said. So let's take another look at the number of Harris County residents recorded as unemployed while White was mayor. The county's annual unemployment rate dropped from 6.8 percent in 2003 to 4.8 in 2008. The 2009 rate isn't available yet, but some 107,403 people were unemployed in December 2008 — when the national economy was reeling. By December 2009, the ranks of the unemployed had grown in Harris County with 164,717 people out of work. We also found that 137,179 more people were employed in Harris County from the time White took office to when he left. The upshot? Shami erred in a couple ways. First, he distorted unemployment in the Houston area. It's true that the raw number of unemployed people increased by more than 42,000 (not 43,000, as Shami claimed) while White was mayor. But the number of unemployed people doesn't translate to the number of jobs lost in Houston. Second, Shami chose not to factor in the share of Harris County residents who were employed, which increased during White's tenure. We rate his claim as False.

pomt-14728	Wisconsin "is on pace to double the number of layoffs" this year.	false	/wisconsin/statements/2015/dec/21/katrina-shankland/numbers-cited-katrina-shankland-layoffs-dont-tell-/	Days after Heinz Kraft announced plans to close the Oscar Mayer plant in Madison, an expected loss of about 1,000 jobs, state Assembly Democrats held a news conference to argue lawmakers should focus on job creation. The news conference came before a session of the state Assembly called by majority Republicans to consider election and campaign finance issues. Democrats said the focus, given the bad news from Oscar Mayer and several other major employers, should be on the economy and jobs. "We are on pace to double layoffs since 2014," declared Assistant Minority Leader Katrina Shankland (D-Stevens Point.) "This is the governor's worst year of his administration in terms of layoffs," she continued. "We're well over 10,000 layoffs and the people of Wisconsin are crying out for action." When we asked Shankland’s office for backup, an aide said Shankland was using state Department of Workforce Development data on notices of plant closings and mass layoffs. Shankland aide Annika Petty noted the "list does not yet include the layoffs announced in early November by Oscar Mayer." Unpacking the numbers For 2014, the state received layoff warning notices that covered 7,239 jobs. As of Nov. 2, 2015, the tally for this year was 11,057. So if you add in the Oscar Mayer layoff,that would bring it to about 12,050. That’s not quite double, but two months of data remained at the time Shankland made her claim and the numbers from earlier months suggest her claim is generally on target. But the layoff number are nowhere near as solid as Shankland suggests. Here is how the system works: In Wisconsin, businesses are required to file warning notices with the state when they anticipate ending employment for more than 50 workers. Wisconsin’s law is more strict than federal law, which sets the threshold at more than 100 workers. But some layoffs never trigger a notice, because they don’t reach the 50 person threshold. And the notices don’t always mean lost jobs. When a company changes hands, the old firm is required to file a notice, even if all the workers will retain their jobs with the new firm. In some cases, layoffs take place immediately. In other cases -- such as with Oscar Mayer -- the plant closing is expected months later. In still others, they never take place. So the numbers don’t represent actual layoffs. As such, experts say they are a lousy tool for assessing the state’s economy. That’s what we found when we rated a July 2015 claim from the liberal group American Bridge 21st Century, which said Wisconsin’s economy had "tanked" under Walker and "so far in 2015 over 6,685 people have been laid off, already more than in all of 2014." We rated the claim False. Shankland’s claim is somewhat different, in that she does not directly cite the number as evidence of the state’s economy tanking. But she did make it at a news conference that asserted more action is needed on jobs due to poor economic performance. Experts such as Brian Jacobsen, an economist at Wells Fargo and a professor at Wisconsin Lutheran College, say a far better indicator of the employment picture -- but one that’s not without it’s own flaws -- is the monthly jobs report. Those numbers show that as of October 2015, the state added an estimated 30,300 jobs in 2015. That includes a preliminary estimate of 15,100 private sector jobs added in October alone. The number is preliminary and subject to change. But the important point is this: Those figures are the net result of all changes, including layoffs and jobs added, not just one side of the coin. Our rating Shankland said Wisconsin "is on pace to double the number of layoffs this year." She cited layoff notices received by the state. But those aren’t actual layoffs. And while she’s about right on the number of notices received, she’s wrong to suggest that the employment numbers are headed downward this year. In the time frame she cited the state’s added about 30,300 jobs. We rate the claim False.	None	Katrina Shankland	None	None	None	2015-12-21T05:00:00	2015-11-16	['None']
pomt-12757	Says "Donald Trump wants to eliminate overtime pay for people."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2017/feb/26/thomas-perez/new-dnc-chair-tom-perez-says-donald-trump-wants-cu/	On his first full day as chairman of the Democratic National Committee, former Labor Department secretary Thomas Perez said the Democratic Party needs to win back American workers who turned to Republicans in the 2016 election. On the Feb. 26 edition of NBC’S Meet the Press, Perez said Democrats fell short by spending too much time bashing President Donald Trump and not enough time talking about a progressive economic message. "We stand for good wages. We stand for Social Security. We stand for retirement security. We brought this nation Medicare," Perez said of Democrats. "The Republicans are trying to voucherize Medicare and privatize Social Security." Then he said something we hadn’t heard before: "Donald Trump wants to eliminate overtime pay for people." While Trump has said he will not cut Social Security, Medicaid or Medicare, other Republicans have laid out plans for restructuring the programs. We wanted to look into the last part of Perez’s comment — is Trump really planning to deliver a KO to OT? To back up his claim, Perez’s team sent clips from three news articles and a memo from Trump’s campaign. However, none of these sources show Trump wants to "eliminate overtime pay," the money earned for working more than a specified number of hours a week. What Trump has said While Trump has not talked about eliminating overtime pay, he has supported rolling back an Obama-era regulation that would expand the number of people eligible for overtime. In an August 2016 interview with the online news service Circa, Trump was asked if there’s any new regulations he wanted to eliminate. The interviewer asked, "What are some fresh examples of federal regulations you’d roll back if you were president? For example, the Labor Department. They have a regulation that’s going to take effect on Dec. 1. It’s going to impose overtime requirements on small business. Would that be one of them?" Trump said the rules regarding overtime were just an example of the type of business regulations he would seek to roll back as president. Trump is quoted as saying, "We have to address the issues of over-taxation and over-regulation and the lack of access to credit markets to get our small business owners thriving again. Rolling back the overtime regulation is just one example of the many regulations that need to be addressed to do that." A small business advisory council memo from the Trump-Pence campaign Oct. 17 conveyed a similar message about the burden of economic regulations. "Labor issues like minimum wage, overtime rules, and union organizing all take their toll, reads the memo. "It seems to many small business owners out here in ‘flyover land’ that the insiders in D.C. have it in for them. And they probably do." It’s not clear from his comments if Trump was referencing any particular rule or regulation, but there is one notable Obama-era rule that made waves in Republican circles in 2016. Most employees in the United States are eligible for time-and-a-half overtime pay if they work more than 40 hours a week. But there’s an exception for white-collar workers. To be considered a white-collar worker by the government, an employee has to make more than $455 per week, be paid salary, and work in an administrative, executive or professional position. People who meet these criteria do not qualify for overtime pay. In March 2014, President Barack Obama signed a presidential memorandum directing the U.S. Labor Department (then led by Perez) to update regulations related to overtime pay in the Fair Labor Standards Act. Two years later, the Obama administration finalized a rule that would shrink the number of workers affected by the "white-collar" exemption. Under Obama’s proposed rule, those workers would be eligible for overtime if they made less than $47,500 a year (up from $26,660). The Department of Labor estimated that 4.2 million workers would become eligible to earn overtime as a result of the new rule. However, many states and businesses, unhappy with the new proposal, filed an emergency motion challenging the rule. On Nov. 22, 2016, U.S. District Judge Amos Mazzant in Texas, sided with those states and business groups and granted their motion for a nationwide injunction. With the new regulation on hold, the Trump administration could have decided whether to continue defending the rule in court, or kill it completely. In response, the White House issued a moratorium on all proposed federal regulations that have yet to take effect. Trump’s Labor Department is without a permanent chief. Trump had nominated fast-food executive Andrew Puzder for the role, though he withdrew from consideration Feb. 15 before a doubtful confirmation vote. Trump then nominated Alexander Acosta, a law school dean at Florida International University and former Justice Department official, who is awaiting confirmation. On Meet the Press, Perez said Trump wanted to eliminate overtime pay, and also that "he nominates someone to head the Labor Department who wants to gut overtime pay." It is likely Perez was referring to Puzder, who was an open critic of Obama’s overtime rule. In a 2014 Wall Street Journal op-ed, Puzder cautioned against "rewarding time spent rather than time well spent." We could not find instances of Acosta opposing the overtime rule. The White House did not respond for comment. Our ruling Perez said Trump "wants to eliminate overtime pay for people". Perez’s statement offers a misleading view of Trump’s position on overtime. Trump’s administration has said he wants to roll back regulations — some of which would expand the number of those eligible for overtime — but that doesn’t translate to wanting to eliminate overtime completely. The regulation that would expand overtime eligibility for white-collar workers has never been enforced because of a pending court challenge.

pomt-08293	"Mr. Renacci was registered as a foreign trade lobbyist in the United States government."	half-true	/ohio/statements/2010/nov/01/john-boccieri/rep-john-boccieri-portrays-challenger-jim-renacci-/	Most days, congressional candidates can’t get donations from lobbyists quickly enough. They’ll even take them from lobbyists who handle a sub-specialty: foreign trade matters. And there’s nothing improper, illegal or fattening about that, because all sides in the nation’s trade battles -- from manufacturers who want cheap raw materials to the United Steelworkers of America, which wants to protect American foundry jobs – hire Washington lobbyists to look out for their interests. So what is up, you might ask, with this criticism of an opponent by John Boccieri, a Democratic incumbent in Ohio’s 16th Congressional District? He accuses Republican challenger Jim Renacci of registering "as a foreign trade lobbyist," as if that were disgraceful. Boccieri launched a cable television ad with that charge in early October. Then on Oct. 18 during a debate with Renacci in Canton, Boccieri repeated it. It’s a fact verifiable from public records, the first-term incumbent said in answer to a question about the tone of ads, "that Mr. Renacci was registered as a foreign trade lobbyist in the United States government." To back up this claim, Boccieri’s campaign pointed to a lobbying registration form filed in May, 2008, with the clerk of the U.S. Senate, where all lobbying registrations are kept. The form was filed by a fledgling consulting firm called Smokerise International Group, formed by three people, including Renacci, a Wadworth businessman. Named for Smokerise Drive, the street on which Renacci and other partners had offices, the firm also filed business registration papers with the Ohio Secretary of State’s office the same month, public records show. The name sounded worldly, but there was nothing else international about it – and certainly not its clients. It had none. The firm never filed a single piece of paper saying it represented anyone, as would be required if it had actual clients. Renacci’s campaign spokesman, James Slepian, says two business associates wanted to form the firm and Renacci agreed to help because of his background as a CPA. The firm "never got off the ground," Slepian said in an e-mail to us, "but as a precautionary measure, one of the partners registered all three of them as lobbyists, just in case they ever took on any lobbying clients." The registration, filed by Laura Mills, an attorney who was listed as vice chairman and owner, included areas of federal policy in which the firm might lobby. They listed nine areas, including defense, aerospace, the budget,small business matters and trade Note that they didn’t say "foreign" trade, which would be redundant because trade is understood to involve the movement of goods or services between two countries. That’s it. They never filed another piece of paper because they never lobbied. You expected a smoking gun? So did we, because calling someone a "foreign trade lobbyist" sounds dastardly. Of the nine potential lobbying areas listed in the Smokerise filing, Boccieri singled out only "trade" for criticism. We agree that might have been a smart tactic on his part, because saying that his opponent "registered as a small business lobbyist" would lack zing. This, then, is the extent of the evidence on which the Boccieri campaign makes its claim. It is Boccieri’s right to cast aspersions on trade lobbyists. But we were curious about his negative feelings, because Boccieri, like many candidates, has accepted campaign donations from lobbyists, according to our review of data from CQ Money Line and the Center for Responsive Politics, which are services that track fund-raising. We looked up some of these donor-lobbyists’ filings in the Senate and found that some have lobbied on trade matters. Or to use Boccieri’s own words: Boccieri even takes money from "foreign trade lobbyists." Not that there’s anything wrong with that. So yes, Renacci is registered as a lobbyist, and his fledgling firm said on its registration form that it intended to lobby on trade. But it ended up not lobbying at all, and had that not been the case, it also might have lobbied on all manner of benign-sounding matters, not a one of which Boccieri singled as horrific. Boccieri’s "foreign trade lobbyist" claim is not false because it contains elements of truth. But it leaves out context and detail, intentionally creating a menacing picture of Renacci’s activities. The claim’s accuracy is overshadowed by those details, and so the Truth-O-Meter considers it Half True.	None	John Boccieri	None	None	None	2010-11-01T14:30:00	2010-10-18	['United_States']
pomt-05213	"More Hispanics have fallen into poverty under Obama."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/jun/08/mitt-romney/romney-ad-says-more-hispanics-are-poverty-obama-to/	In a new Web ad, the Romney campaign questions how Hispanics in the U.S. have fared under President Barack Obama. The ad, titled "Dismal," flashes shadowy faces of Latinos along with text citing rising unemployment and poverty rates in that minority group. The statistics are bookended by clips from Obama’s own Spanish-language ads that say the country is moving in the right direction. "Really?" the ad asks. We decided to take a look at one of those statistical claims, specifically that "more Hispanics have fallen into poverty under Obama." As evidence, the ad cites U.S. Census Bureau figures, which show that poverty has been on the rise. In 2008, the census says, there were about 47.4 million Hispanics in the U.S. Almost 11 million, or 23.2 percent were impoverished. In 2009, 48.8 million Hispanics were living in the U.S., with more than 12 million in poverty. That marked a 2.1 percent increase in the poverty rate. And in 2010, it ticked up another 1.3 percent. All told, through 2010, 2.25 million more Hispanics are living in poverty than when Obama took office. So the numbers back up the point. But it's important to explore how much the Hispanic poverty rate can be blamed on Obama's policies. When rating claims such as this, PolitiFact weighs not only whether the claim is numerically correct but also whether it’s accurate to assign blame to the target of the ad. First, we should note that poverty across all groups was up in these years. The nation’s official poverty rate went from 14.3 percent in 2009 to 15.1 percent in 2010. So Hispanics weren’t alone, but they were harder hit. "Poverty increased for pretty much every demographic group in the country. There are more poor whites, blacks and Hispanics," said Madeline Zavodny, a professor of economics at Agnes Scott College in Decatur, Georgia, and a research fellow at the conservative American Enterprise Institute. But Hispanics felt the impact more. "They are especially vulnerable to downturns. They are more likely to work in cyclical industries, like construction and manufacturing, than other demographic groups. Construction in particular was hit hard this downturn, and Hispanics bore the brunt of that," Zavodny said. Sheldon Danziger, director of the National Poverty Center at the University of Michigan, said it's off-base to pin the blame on Obama. "It’s not like anything Obama did was anti-Hispanic," Danziger said. "It’s because of the collapse of construction." Mark Hugo Lopez, associate director of the Pew Hispanic Center, pointed to the original trigger for the recession: the housing bubble. When the economy was growing, largely on the expanding housing market, many Hispanics were able to buy their own homes. That tied up their wealth, which tends to be less diversified than non-Hispanics who invest more widely in stocks and 401(k) funds, Lopez said. So when the bubble burst and housing values fell, many Hispanics saw their household wealth evaporate. Gary Burtless from the centrist Brookings Institution added that the Hispanic population is younger as a whole than other groups, "and younger adults have suffered badly -- in the job market and as new homeowners who may be under water as a result of declining house prices." (As we’ve noted before, Burtless contributed $750 to Obama’s campaign in 2011. However, in 2008 he provided advice on aspects of labor policy to the presidential campaign of Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., and he has worked as a government economist and served on federal advisory panels under presidents of both parties.) We also talked to Leticia Miranda, senior policy adviser for the National Council of La Raza, a Hispanic advocacy group. She said unemployment is the single biggest driver of poverty and Hispanics are particularly vulnerable. She said that some policies have had a direct impact on Hispanics, such as the 1996 welfare reform bill, which imposed a five-year ban on use of public assistance including Medicaid, food stamps and welfare cash payments by legal immigrants. But she said Obama has made some positive strides to benefit Hispanics. Under Obama, the Department of Labor has put a greater focus on low-wage workers as well as on wage theft -- essentially workers not getting paid for their labor -- which tends to afflict immigrant workers, Miranda said. Finally, each of the experts we interviewed mentioned the economic stimulus package Obama signed in 2009 as a barrier that kept poverty from ballooning even more. The Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a liberal think tank, determined that direct income assistance from the stimulus kept 2 million additional Hispanics from falling below the poverty line. Author Arloc Sherman found that 500,000 Hispanics benefitted from the temporary Making Work Pay tax credit, more than 600,000 from temporary improvements to the Earned Income Tax Credit and other tax credits for low-income working families, and more than 600,000 Latino Americans kept out of poverty through 2009 and 2010 extensions of stronger unemployment insurance championed by the president. Miranda called those "big positives for low-wage workers." Our ruling Romney’s ad correctly states that more Hispanics in the U.S. have fallen below the poverty line since Obama took office: 2.25 million more people through 2010, according to the census. But the ad’s clear message is that it’s Obama’s fault but experts say it's a much more complicated picture than that. We rate the statement Half True.

pomt-04638	David Cicilline was "required to provide key information about city finances to an independent outside auditor. The deadlines were clear -- yet [he intentionally] missed them by months" until after the November 2010 election.	mostly false	/rhode-island/statements/2012/sep/14/brendan-doherty/brendan-doherty-says-incumbent-us-rep-david-cicill/	Republican Brendan Doherty wasted no time coming out of the starting gate for the general election race with Democratic U.S. Rep. David Cicilline for the 1st District seat. Less than 12 hours after Cicilline won the Sept. 11 Democratic primary, Doherty held a news conference listing Cicilline's top 10 "most serious deceptions." We decided to look at number four, which focused on the outside audit of Providence finances covering the final fiscal year when Cicilline was mayor. (We’ll be examining another item in Doherty's "top 10" separately.) We quote from Doherty's news release attacking Cicilline: "INTENTIONALLY MISSED DEADLINES: You were also required to provide key information about city finances to an independent outside auditor. The deadlines were clear -- yet you missed them by months. You delayed providing that information until after you were elected to Congress." Our mind-reading skills are limited, so we can't judge whether any delay was prompted by an intent to withhold information until after the Nov. 2, 2010, general election. So we e-mailed the Doherty campaign late Wednesday to see if it had any evidence to back up that part of the allegation. Meanwhile, knowing that Cicilline has repeatedly said he is responsible for the decisions made during his tenure, we were interested in whether his administration had clear deadlines that it missed by months. Doherty's press release cited an April 20, 2011, report, "Corrective Action Plan to Restore Sound Financial Management," written by Matthew M. Clarkin Jr., the city's internal auditor after Cicilline's departure, and Gary Sasse, who worked for 30 years as executive director of the nonprofit Rhode Island Public Expenditure Council and, more recently, a fiscal adviser to the Providence City Council. (The independent auditor does the city's official audit. The internal auditor works as a financial watchdog on behalf of the City Council.) The report says that according to the independent auditor, Braver PC, when it was time to do the audit for the fiscal year ending June 30, 2010, "For the first time in more than a decade the City requested a one-month extension from the Auditor General for the 2010 audit." State law gives cities and towns six months to complete annual audits. According to the report, "In August 2010, Braver submitted a list of documents and information to the Director of Finance, [documents] that were required to complete the annual audit, as well as a deadline for the submission of each item." On page 14, the report has a chart listing 15 types of financial information due by Oct. 12, 2010, or earlier, none of which was submitted to the auditor until after the Nov. 2 election, according to Braver. The delays ranged from about two months to about four months. The report says the auditing firm "was forced on several occasions to extend those deadlines. According to Braver, some of the information requested was not delivered until the day the report was released on January 31, 2011." The report verified that the city was in serious financial trouble. James Wilkinson, who oversaw the audit for Braver, confirmed the information in the Clarkin / Sasse report. The city had agreed to the original deadlines, he said. Clarkin also sent us an e-mail from Wilkinson suggesting changes in the report. Wilkinson, in fact, suggests only minor alterations to the chart showing how the deadlines were missed, and he recommends adding the note that some requested information didn't come in until the day the audit was released. But Wilkinson also ended his e-mail with an explanation for the delays. "This year's closing process was marked by delays and problems caused by miscommunication among the accounting personnel. We believe that the year-end closing could proceed more quickly and smoothly by developing a logical order for closing procedures and assigning responsibility for completing the procedures to specific personnel," he wrote. That speaks to a finance department in disarray under Cicilline, not one withholding data for political purposes, as Doherty implies. Wilkinson said the delay in 2010 was unusual for Providence. "They did have turnover in the finance department so there were a lot of things going on," he said. "There was cooperation but it was taking a while." But more important, according to Wilkinson, if the city had met all of its deadlines for supplying financial information, the audit still would not have been completed before the election. It typically comes out in late December. Cicilline spokesman Eric Hyers said Doherty falsely assumed that Cicilline knew about the auditor's deadlines and that the mayor instructed his staff to miss the deadlines. "Neither of those things happened." Doherty campaign spokesman Robert Coupe acknowledged that there was no smoking gun showing that Cicilline or his staff ordered a delay in the release of financial data. But the delay, he said, was part of a pattern that kept the public in the dark about the city's finances. There "was a consistent pattern of withholding key financial information, not only from the external auditor, but also from the internal auditor, the City Council and the Rhode Island Division of Municipal Finance," he said. That shows intent, Coupe argued. This "was not an accident but was a component of the overall pattern and therefore intentional." Our ruling Brendan Doherty said David Cicilline, when he was mayor of Providence, was "required to provide key information about city finances to an independent outside auditor. The deadlines were clear -- yet [he intentionally] missed them by months" until after the November 2010 election. A subsequent report by the city on what led to its financial problems, along with a supporting e-mail from the firm that did the outside audit, support the claim that many deadlines for the outside audit were not met by the Cicilline administration. However, Doherty declared that Cicilline intentionally withheld the information until after the election, suggesting that the delay was designed to help him get elected to Congress. We previously gave Cicilline a Mostly False on his statement that the internal auditor for the city of Providence "was not locked out" of access to the city's finances. We found evidence of serious delays but ultimately, in that case, that auditor (Clarkin's predecessor) received the long-sought information before the November election. But in this instance, involving the outside audit, we've seen no real evidence -- and Doherty provided none -- that the delays were part of an attempt by Cicilline to hide bad news from voters. The facts argue otherwise. The external auditor himself judged the delays to be caused by a finance department in disarray. And even if every deadline had been met, the results of the audit would not have been released before the November election. Such audits are due at the end of the year, nearly two months after the votes are counted, a timetable noted in the very document the Doherty campaign cites. In the end, we have the former head of the Rhode Island State Police making allegations without key evidence, and ignoring evidence that points in another direction. Because his statement contains some element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression, we rate it Mostly False.

abbc-00234	With the Turnbull Government's proposed corporate tax cut stalled in the Upper House, the business lobby has been ramping up efforts to convince a handful of crossbench senators to pass the legislation.	in-between	http://www.abc.net.au/news/2018-04-23/fact-check-corporate-tax-cuts-and-higher-wages/9652850	Senator Watt is on shaky ground. Although he accurately points out that half of the signatories to the BCA letter represent companies that did not pay any corporate tax in 2015-16, it is a stretch to suggest this means these companies would not be in a position to pass on potential future benefits — however small — in the form of higher wages. As experts noted, using a single year (in this case, 2015-16) to make a broad assertion about the future is problematic. Should the legislation be passed, the tax cut would not apply until the next decade for some larger companies. In their letter, the executives left open the timing of future wage increases resulting from the tax cut, promising stronger wages growth "as the tax cut takes effect". As experts pointed out, whether a company pays corporate tax in a given year depends on a range of factors, including market conditions, past capital investments and tax offsets. Not paying company tax in a particular year does not mean a business will not pay company tax in the future. Indeed, some of the signatory companies that did not pay corporate tax in 2015-16 have indicated they are on track to pay corporate tax in the near future. Economic modelling by Treasury and other analysts has concluded the corporate tax cuts would also broadly boost the economy, although the impact is likely to be modest. Whether other policies would be more effective in boosting wages is a different issue, and not the subject of this fact check; nor is whether the corporate tax plan — which is expected to cost about $65 billion over a decade — is in the nation's best interests, or should be prioritised over other budget measures.

pomt-06122	"Newt balanced the federal budget."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/dec/28/winning-our-future/ad-credits-newt-gingrich-balancing-budget/	A TV ad airing in Iowa in the final week before the caucuses calls Newt Gingrich a "principled conservative" who has "fought for us." Here’s how: "Newt balanced the federal budget, reformed welfare, cut taxes and created 11 million new jobs," a man’s voice says as photos of Gingrich flash on the screen. The ad was produced the week of Dec. 26, 2011, by a group called Winning Our Future, a "super PAC" that can raise money for elections but isn’t formally affiliated with any candidate. Winning Our Future is clearly pro-Gingrich, stating on its website that its goal is to make him the Republican nominee for president. The ad makes several claims. Here, we’re focusing on the assertion that Gingrich balanced the federal budget. We’ve previously reported that there were indeed budget surpluses during his time as speaker of the House, from 1995 to 1999. By fiscal year 1998, the federal budget did reach a surplus of $69 billion. And in fiscal year 1999 -- which Gingrich can claim some responsibility for, even though he was out as speaker for most of the fiscal year -- it was in surplus as well, to the tune of $126 billion. So our main question is, how much credit does Gingrich deserve? We asked several experts who said it's a stretch to credit Gingrich alone because there were many forces and people at work in bringing the government to a balanced budget. The primary one: a booming economy. "The budget ended up balancing faster than either party expected simply because economic growth was so strong," said Chris Edwards, an economist at the libertarian Cato Institute. "I don’t think either party had much to do with that." He does credit Gingrich for pushing President Bill Clinton toward reducing the deficit. In his 1996 budget, "Clinton proposed to stabilize the deficit at around $190 billion. He did not propose to balance the budget. The Republicans under Gingrich pushed him into it," Edwards said, and that materialized in the Balanced Budget Act of 1997. Stan Collender, a former Democratic staffer for the House and Senate budget committees, was less generous about crediting Gingrich. "It happened on his watch but it doesn’t mean that he gets credit for it," said Collender. "The only thing you can give him credit for is stalling some additional spending programs." Collender agreed that the balanced budget was more a result of "a soaring economy, with capital gains taxes coming in, and the tech bubble than it had anything to do with legislation." Steve Ellis, vice president of Taxpayers for Common Sense, said Gingrich is simply doing what politicians do. "He’s just kind of ignoring that there was anybody else in Washington doing anything about the budget, which is kind of in a politician’s DNA," Ellis said. Another factor Ellis cited is the 1993 tax increase that Clinton pushed through, over Gingrich’s and all other House Republicans’ objections. Tax increases generated more revenue, which led to surpluses. "It’s not necessarily the spending differential, it’s the revenue differential," Ellis said. Stuart Rothenberg, editor of the Rothenberg Political Report, summed up the ad’s claim this way: "The idea that one person, in this case Gingrich, is responsible for a balanced budget seems far-fetched at best and, frankly, pretty silly. Ever hear of checks and balances?" Our ruling Winning Our Future’s ad says, "Newt balanced the federal budget." Gingrich was House speaker in 1998, the first year of the surplus, and he can be given some credit for the 1999 surplus, even though he was out of Congress for most of that fiscal year. Even so, simply being speaker during the surplus years doesn’t mean that the balanced budget was his doing. He pushed for it, yes. But other factors like Clinton’s 1993 tax increase -- which Gingrich opposed -- were at work, too. And our experts agreed that a booming economy, generating millions more revenue, was the single most important factor, and one that no politician can take credit for. We rate the ad’s claim Half True.	None	Winning Our Future	None	None	None	2011-12-28T17:31:00	2011-12-27	['None']
pomt-15170	"Many of the great scholars say that anchor babies are not covered" by the 14th Amendment.	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/aug/25/donald-trump/trump-many-scholars-say-anchor-babies-arent-covere/	Donald Trump says his plan to roll back birthright citizenship for children of illegal immigrants will pass constitutional muster because "many of the great scholars say that anchor babies are not covered." "Many of the great scholars" -- really? That comment caught our attention. In case you need a refresher on birthright citizenship: As it stands now, any person born on U.S. soil is a citizen -- regardless of the parents’ immigration status -- because of the citizenship clause of the 14th Amendment. Trump has recently advocated for pulling back citizenship for illegal immigrants’ children. Some, like Trump, refer to these children as "anchor babies." "The parents have to come in legally," Trump said, talking to reporters in New Hampshire Aug. 19. "Now we’re going to have to find out what’s going to happen from a court standpoint. But many people, many of the great scholars say that anchor babies are not covered (by the 14th Amendment). We’re going to have to find out." Considering that about 300,000 babies are born to illegal immigrants and become citizens every year, we wondered if Trump is right to say that "many" scholars think this isn’t necessarily a constitutional right. We won’t dig into who’s a "great" scholar, but we will look at how widespread this position is and if "many" say the 14th Amendment isn’t an impediment to Trump’s plan. Differing interpretations The 14th Amendment became part of the Constitution in 1868 following the Civil War. The amendment established birthright citizenship and equal protection under the law for all citizens, making newly freed slaves full American citizens. The relevant clause reads: "All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside." Today, this clause is widely understood to mean that the Constitution requires that everyone born on U.S. soil -- regardless of parents’ citizenship -- is automatically an American citizen. We polled a number of experts in immigration law, and each one told us that this is the mainstream view among legal scholars, without question. The matter is not considered 100 percent settled, though. For one, the clause doesn’t directly address illegal immigration. Also, the Supreme Court has never made a specific ruling about a person born to undocumented parents. The most relevant Supreme Court ruling was in an 1898 case, United States vs. Wong Kim Ark. The court decided that a man, Wong Kim Ark, was an American citizen because he was born in America, even though his parents were Chinese immigrants. Because his parents were legal residents, the case does not directly apply to children of undocumented parents. To Trump’s point, there are some scholars who argue the 14th Amendment allows birthright citizenship for illegal immigrants but does not require it. This is a subtle but important point, because if the Constitution does not require birthright citizenship, Congress might be able to change the law without having to pass a Constitutional amendment, an arduous process. In any case, this viewpoint is held by only a handful of legal scholars, not "many." "I believe that Trump’s statement is incorrect," said Yale Law School professor Peter Schuck, one of the leading scholars who has endorsed this position. "I would say that our view on the constitutional issue is decidedly the minority view." The gist of the argument rests on the fact that the 14th Amendment requires people to be born on U.S. soil and be "subject to the jurisdiction thereof" to receive citizenship at birth, as the amendment says. To understand this point a little better, consider the example of children of foreign diplomats born in the United States. These children are not citizens because their parents have allegiance to a foreign country and not the United States -- meaning they are not subject to U.S. jurisdiction. Some people interpret the inclusion of "jurisdiction" as requiring mutual consent for citizenship: The person and the United States have to agree that this person is eligible for citizenship. If the parent is here illegally, does the United States agree that the child should be eligible for citizenship? Congress could, according to this point of view, decide that the answer to this question is "no," rendering the 14th Amendment inapplicable to these children, without violating the Constitution. We won’t dig into this question further -- there’s a lot of history and judicial precedent to digest on both sides of the argument. (If you want to read more, we recommend this 2010 Congressional Research Report.) The small group of scholars who endorse this idea -- that Congress can decide whether birthright citizenship extends to children of undocumented immigrants -- is not strictly partisan. Schuck is a self-described moderate, and he published the primary book on this topic in the 1980s with University of Pennsylvania professor Rogers Smith, who is liberal. Many of the scholars who have come out in support of this view in the past few weeks have conservative backgrounds, such as Edward Erler and John Eastman, both of the conservative Claremont Institute think tank. But not all conservatives share this point of view, either. Also, at least one federal judge has said publicly that interpreting the 14th Amendment in this way wouldn’t require changing the Constitution: Hon. Richard Posner of the 7th Circuit, appointed by President Ronald Reagan. Still, these legal thinkers "are in a very small minority," said Evelyn Cruz, director of the Immigration Law and Policy Clinic at Arizona State University’s law school. "Most scholars believe that the Constitution would need to be amended to achieve a reading opposite to Wong Kim Ark." Our ruling Trump said, "Many of the great scholars say that anchor babies are not covered" by the 14th Amendment. There are respected academics who argue that the 14th Amendment allows but does not require children of illegal immigrants to receive citizenship just by virtue of having been born on American soil. However, this is a minority of immigration and constitutional law scholars, far outweighed by those who believe the 14th Amendment requires birthright citizenship for children of illegal immigrants.

pomt-06675	"Michael Dukakis created jobs three times faster" than Mitt Romney.	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/sep/08/rick-perry/dukakis-created-jobs-three-times-faster-mitt-romne/	Republican contenders for the presidential nomination Rick Perry and Mitt Romney sparred over jobs at a debate at the Reagan Library -- how many, what kind and who created them. The back-and-forth was full of stats and numbers, with Perry claiming his job-creation record as the Texas governor was superior to Romney's record as Massachusetts governor. And if that's wasn't enough, Perry said Romney's record was even worse than a Democrat's. "Michael Dukakis created jobs three times faster than you did, Mitt," Perry jabbed. We decided to fact-check whether Perry's attack was accurate. As is our usual procedure, we wanted to check both whether the number was correct and the implication that Romney's policies contributed to the outcome. We'll begin by saying there are several different ways to count jobs, and the numbers change slightly depending on the parameters of your search. We decided to use numbers from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. Michael Dukakis was governor for three terms, while Romney was governor for one term. (Dukakis was governor from 1975 to 1979 and from 1983 to 1991. Romney was governor from 2003 to 2007.) We could make a number of choices about how to calculate job growth by selecting different parameters, particularly whether we should look at growth on annual basis or whether we should look at when the governors took office and when they left. By some of our calculations, Dukakis created three times more jobs than Romney, and by other calculations, it was even more. As we researched the item more, we found an analysis published a few days before the debate by Matt Lewis of The Daily Caller. Lewis looked at different job statistics and concluded that Dukakis created jobs faster than Romney did. Using numbers from the Massachusetts Executive Office of Labor and Workforce Development, Lewis found that Dukakis created an average of about 45,209 jobs per year, while Romney created an average of 12,850 jobs per year. So using those numbers, Dukakis' job creation was about three and half times Romney's. In a follow-up to his original post, Lewis noted that the Romney campaign objected to his analysis but not because they questioned the underlying numbers. Rather, they said that Romney inherited large deficits that harmed job creation and that the unemployment rate was lower when Romney left office than when Dukakis left office. Lewis said that he believed his original analysis still had merit. After looking at numbers from BLS, we concluded that Dukakis did have more robust job growth than Romney, and three times is a reasonable estimate, keeping in mind that one could use other reasonable estimates. We also noticed that Romney had his worst job growth during his first two years, giving creedence to the argument that his policies hadn't yet had time to take effect. Now to our second point: Is there any evidence that Dukakis' policies led to robust job growth, while Romney's didn't? We asked the Perry campaign for evidence, but we didn't hear back. To pursue that issue, we spoke with Michael Widmer, president of the Massachusetts Taxpayers Foundation, an independent public policy organization. (Its board includes many business executives.) Widmer confirmed that there was a faster rate of growth under Dukakis than Romney, but he warned that governors have little ability to create jobs in the short term. He attributed the growth under Dukakis to a growing computer industry in Massachusetts that was focused around what were then called minicomputers, computers sized between a mainframe and a personal computer. "Massachusetts bet on the mini, while Silicon Valley bet on the PC," Widmer said. "None of that had anything to do with a governor, before, after or since." The bet on the mini didn't go so well, and job growth was dwindling even as Dukakis left office. And even when jobs were growing under Dukakis, people in Massachusetts didn't particularly credit his policies. "Many business leaders were critical of Dukakis for not being more supportive of the business community and policies that they thought would be helpful. But then jobs were still created because of the outside factors," Widmer said. Meanwhile, when Romney was governor, jobs were created slowly as Massachusetts pulled out of a nationwide recession. "Again, there was little connection between that and the initiatives of Gov. Romney," Widmer said. Romney himself made a similar point in the debate with Perry, saying that robust job growth in Texas can't be compared directly to job growth in Massachusetts. "States are different. Texas is a great state. Texas has zero income tax. Texas has a right to work state, a Republican Legislature, a Republican Supreme Court. Texas has a lot of oil and gas in the ground," Romney said. "Those are wonderful things, but Governor Perry doesn't believe that he created those things." In ruling on this statement, Perry is correct that Dukakis did grow jobs at a faster pace than Romney. But we find little evidence that meant Dukakis was better at job creation. Rather, larger factors were at work, such as the way the computer industry in Massachusetts was developing, as well as national economic trends. So we rate Perry's statement Half True.

pomt-05385	Says "an unchecked Democratic Majority in Trenton" is responsible for "years of diversions" from the state’s unemployment insurance trust fund.	mostly false	/new-jersey/statements/2012/may/07/anthony-bucco/state-sen-anthony-bucco-claims-democrat-led-legisl/	Democrats have been in control of the New Jersey Legislature for so many years that they can be held responsible for many of the state’s financial woes. But when it comes to diverting money from the state’s unemployment benefits fund, the Republican-led Legislature of years past deserves its share of the blame as well. In a May 1 news release, however, state Sen. Anthony Bucco (R-Morris) targeted "an unchecked Democratic Majority in Trenton" for diverting money from that fund, which is used to pay unemployment benefits to people who worked in New Jersey. "The Administration is to be applauded for putting the state’s unemployment insurance fund on the path to solvency more quickly than anyone expected," Bucco said in the news release. "Through a combination of tax reforms, efficiencies, and aggressive prosecution of fraud and abuse, this Governor has fixed the mess he inherited as a result of years of diversions and fiscal irresponsibility by an unchecked Democratic Majority in Trenton." The senator’s claim is largely wrong, PolitiFact New Jersey found. About 67 percent of the roughly $4.6 billion in total diverted funds was due to legislation passed by the Republican-controlled Legislature between 1992 and 1997, according to the state’s nonpartisan Office of Legislative Services. Due in part to the fund diversions -- as well as the increased demand for unemployment benefits -- the fund was depleted by March 2009 and New Jersey began borrowing from the federal government to cover benefit payments. State officials anticipate paying off the loan by May 2014. Starting with a law enacted in late 1992, a total of about $4.6 billion has been diverted from the trust fund to cover charity care payments to hospitals, according to the OLS. The Republican-led Legislature approved legislation in 1992, 1996 and 1997 that led to the diversion of $3.141 billion, representing about 67 percent of the total diverted funds. In 2002 and 2003, Democrats controlled the State Assembly and the two parties shared control of the Senate. During those two years, legislators approved diverting $1.1 billion, or about 23 percent of the total funds. After Democrats took full control of both houses in 2004, the Legislature agreed to divert $450 million, which is about 10 percent of the total funds. Adam Bauer, a spokesman for the Senate Republicans, acknowledged that Republicans also diverted money from the trust fund. But he argued that the trust fund balance still increased when the GOP was in the majority. "Bucco’s line about ‘fiscal irresponsibility’ holds up because a diversion when the fund is not being stressed because of high unemployment and is approaching its record high fund balance is not irresponsible, but a diversion when there is high stress on the fund because of job loss and the fund is nearing a record low is irresponsible," Bauer said in an e-mail. Joseph Henchman, vice president of Legal & State Projects for the business-backed Tax Foundation, said he could understand both holding money in reserve as well as ensuring it "doesn't grow so large as to create pressure for unnecessarily higher benefits or beyond any possible future needs." "I can see both sides on this: on one hand, you want the fund to have enough in reserve to pay benefits when the economy dips, but you also don't want to accumulate funds beyond what you need," Henchman told us in an e-mail. Our ruling In a May 1 news release, Bucco claimed in regard to the state’s unemployment benefits fund that Gov. Chris Christie "has fixed the mess he inherited as a result of years of diversions and fiscal irresponsibility by an unchecked Democratic Majority in Trenton." Both political parties are responsible for diverting money from the trust fund. But of the roughly $4.6 billion in total diverted funds, about 67 percent of that was approved by the Republican-led Legislature between 1992 and 1997. We rate the statement Mostly False.

pomt-01454	Says Sen. Kay Hagan "has missed half of the (Senate Armed Services) Committee's hearings in 2014."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2014/oct/02/thom-tillis/thom-tillis-claims-kay-hagan-didnt-attend-half-arm/	The rise of the terrorist group known variously as ISIS, ISIL or the Islamic State has increased the role of national security in the political conversation just a month before the midterm elections. In North Carolina, state House speaker and Republican U.S. Senate candidate Thom Tillis released an ad that blames his Democratic opponent Sen. Kay Hagan for being missing in action as the ISIS threat grew. "In January, President Obama refers to the Islamic State as a ‘JV team,’ " the narrator says. "Days later the Armed Services Committee holds a hearing on new global threats. Sen. Kay Hagan? Absent. In fact, Hagan’s missed half the Armed Services Committee hearings this year." We’ve already checked whether Obama referred to the Islamic State as a JV team (he did). Here, we’ll review Tillis’ characterization of Hagan’s attendance record on the Senate Armed Services Committee. We went through all the committee’s meeting transcripts for 2014 to see which lawmakers were in attendance for each hearing. In compiling the information, we ran into an obstacle. Because the Senate Armed Services Committee often reviews confidential national-security information, it sometimes meets behind closed doors. Minutes for those meetings are not released to the public. Therefore, we’re not able to determine attendance for those meetings. In 2014, it appears there have been 11 closed hearings by the full committee. However, the committee has also held 22 open meetings this year, so we limited our calculations to those. How many of the public meetings has Hagan attended? The record shows the answer is nine. That’s not a great percentage — 41 percent — but is nine par for the course for a busy senator? Not exactly. While Hagan didn’t have the worst attendance among the 26 members of the Armed Services Committee this year, she came close. Only five senators — Roy Blunt, R-Mo.; Claire McCaskill, D-Mo.; David Vitter, R-La.; Ted Cruz, R-Texas; and Mark Udall, D-Colo. — attended fewer meetings. Meanwhile, six of her colleagues attended at least 20 of the 22 meetings. Sen. Carl Levin, D-Mich., as the chairman, and Sen. Jim Inhofe, R-Okla., as the ranking Republican, would be expected to have perfect or near-perfect attendance. But Sens. Kelly Ayotte, R-N.H., Joe Donnelly, D-Ind., Tim Kaine, D-Va., and John McCain, R-Ariz., were present for at least 20 hearings. For the sake of argument, let’s go back a year and look at 2013. The Senate Armed Services Committee held 28 open hearings in 2013, of which Hagan attended 14, putting her among those who attended hearings least often. For those two years combined, then, Hagan was present for 23 of 50 open hearings. Only six senators have attended fewer open meetings. Republicans Vitter and Cruz attended the fewest hearings, 16, of any of the committee members. Hagan’s campaign did not dispute those numbers, but staffers said they were taken out of context. They pointed us to an article by the Charlotte Observer that quotes Tara Andringa, spokeswoman for Levin. According to the Observer, Andringa said, "Hagan appeared to have ‘one of the best attendance records on the committee.’ " That didn’t mirror our findings, so we reached out to Andringa for clarification. We didn’t hear back. Hagan’s campaign also explained that scheduling conflicts and other duties — including constituent issues, other committee hearings and bill drafting — kept her from attending all the committee meetings. Let’s take a closer look at the February hearing "on new global threats" that Tillis highlighted in his ad. Hagan’s campaign said she did not attend that hearing on Feb. 11 on "Current and Future World Threats" because she had a constituent meeting with Jerry Ensminger, a former Marine who had discovered that families living on the Camp Lejeune military base in North Carolina were getting sick and, in some cases, dying from contaminated tap water used on the base from 1957 to 1987. (Congress passed legislation to assist the victims of this problem in 2012 and Ensminger and others continue to lobby Congress for further investigation.) The Feb. 11 meeting, which included testimony from Director of National Intelligence James Clapper, continued in a closed session on the afternoon of Feb. 27. It’s unclear whether Hagan attended the closed hearing (and they didn’t tell us). However, her campaign said she missed another Senate Armed Services Committee hearing in the morning of the same day to attend a banking committee meeting. Our ruling Tillis said that Hagan "has missed half of the (Senate Armed Services) Committee's hearings in 2014." We don’t know the number of closed meetings she attended, so it’s more accurate to say that Hagan missed half of the committee’s public hearings. Still, Tillis has a point — in 2014, Hagan attended nine of the 22 open hearings, which is not only below half but which also ranked near the bottom among committee members. The comment is accurate but needs clarification or additional information, so we rate it Mostly True. Update, Oct. 3, 2014, 11:00 a.m.: This version of the story reflects additional information about why Hagan was unable to attend the Feb. 11 Senate Armed Services Committee meeting and about her schedule on Feb. 27. The additional information does not affect the ruling, which remains Mostly True.	None	Thom Tillis	None	None	None	2014-10-02T17:11:49	2014-09-30	['Kay_Hagan']
pomt-05495	"The non-partisan Congressional Budget Office concluded ObamaCare will cost the U.S. more than 800,000 jobs."	mostly false	/texas/statements/2012/apr/17/roger-williams/roger-williams-says-cbo-forecasts-obamacare-will-c/	Republican U.S House candidate Roger Williams of Texas promises to "end the fraud of Obamacare" in a mailer to Austin-area voters we spotted April 11, 2012. His mailer lists among promises broken by President Obama the notion that the 2010 overhaul of health care laws would create jobs. Under "Promise Broken," the mailer says: "The non-partisan Congressional Budget Office concluded ObamaCare will cost the U.S. more than 800,000 jobs." Really? Williams’ footnoted backup was a Feb. 11, 2011, blog post on AmericanThinker.com saying that Doug Elmendorf, director of the Congressional Budget Office, had just testified to the House Budget Committee that as of 2020-21, the law was projected to reduce U.S. employment by 800,000. PolitiFact researchers have explored this testimony and topic before, most recently for a June 2011 Truth-O-Meter article after U.S. Rep. Michele Bachmann said in a Republican presidential debate: "The CBO, the Congressional Budget Office, has said that Obamacare will kill 800,000 jobs. What could the president be thinking by passing a bill like this, knowing full well it will kill 800,000 jobs?" Broadly, the projection is open to misinterpretation. The CBO is a nonpartisan agency that provides economic analyses to members of Congress on how legislation will affect the federal budget and the economy. And in August 2010, it published a new outlook that considered the jobs impact of the just-approved health care law. While the CBO had determined the law would reduce "the amount of labor used in the economy," that was not the same as concluding that 800,000 jobs would be shed. Let’s begin with the negative effects the health care law could have on employment. The law was expected to cost some employers money, particularly large ones. Under its provisions, employers aren't required to offer insurance, yet if they don't and their workers make low wages and qualify for tax credits to buy insurance, then the employers will have to pay a fine. (This part of the law takes effect in 2014.) Even so, the CBO has said, fines imposed on large employers will affect low-wage workers the most. The CBO also projected the effects to be somewhat limited. "To the extent that changes in the health insurance system lead to improved health status among workers, the nation’s economic productivity could be enhanced," the CBO said in its report. "It is not clear, however, whether such changes would have a substantial impact on overall economic productivity or output. Moreover, many of the effects of the legislation may not be felt for several years because it will take time for workers and employers to recognize and to adapt to the new incentives." Still, that's not where the 800,000 jobs number comes from. It primarily comes from workers who choose not to work because they no longer have to work at jobs just to keep their health coverage. Here's how the CBO put it: "The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimates that the legislation, on net, will reduce the amount of labor used in the economy by a small amount—roughly half a percent—primarily by reducing the amount of labor that workers choose to supply. That net effect reflects changes in incentives in the labor market that operate in both directions: Some provisions of the legislation will discourage people from working more hours or entering the workforce, and other provisions will encourage them to work more. Moreover, many people will be unaffected by those provisions and will face the same incentives regarding work as they do under current law." Basically, the CBO was saying that that once some people working mostly to keep their health insurance have other options -- to enroll in Medicaid, or to qualify for tax breaks to buy insurance from a health exchange -- they might choose to work less. The CBO describes this as a "small segment" of the population, about half a percent of the labor force. Notably, the CBO doesn't use the 800,000 jobs number in its report; critics of the law have extrapolated that number by calculating what half a percent of the workforce equals. Then again, as noted, then-CBO director Douglas Elmendorf confirmed that number in his February 2011 testimony. Elmendorf also explained, though, that the number was an extrapolation, and might not be precise. He said: "That means that if the reduction in the labor used was workers working the average number of hours in the economy and earning the average wage, that there would be a reduction of 800,000 workers. "In fact, as we mentioned in the -- in our announcements last summer, the legislation also creates incentives that might affect the number of hours people work, might affect the tendency to work with lower and higher income people. We haven't tried to quantify those things. But the impact is that these 800,000 (jobs) might not be exactly the number ..." The CBO report also noted that the health care law could actually help economic productivity: "To the extent that changes in the health insurance system lead to improved health status among workers, the nation’s economic productivity could be enhanced. It is not clear, however, whether such changes would have a substantial impact on overall economic productivity or output. Moreover, many of the effects of the legislation may not be felt for several years because it will take time for workers and employers to recognize and to adapt to the new incentives." PolitiFact rated Bachmann’s claim -- that the law "will kill 800,000 jobs" -- Mostly False because it exaggerated the CBO’s conclusions in a misleading fashion and included no qualifiers. When we inquired, a CBO staff spokeswoman, Deborah Kilroe, had no comment on the earlier PolitiFact analysis. Kilroe did say the CBO had done no additional analyses of projected reductions in employment due to the 2010 law. Our ruling The CBO says there could be the equivalent of 800,000 fewer workers in connection with Obamacare, the changes in federal health-care laws ushered into place by Obama. But these changes would not be due to employers not hiring workers. Rather, such results were predicted primarily because workers wouldn't have to work because health care coverage would be expanded. People working mostly for health insurance would either reduce their hours or leave the job market altogether. There could also be more economic productivity because of the health care law.

pomt-04982	Says President Barack Obama "has not raised taxes."	false	/new-jersey/statements/2012/jul/22/bill-pascrell/bill-pascrell-claims-barack-obama-has-not-raised-t/	Forget social issues. U.S. Rep. Bill Pascrell said he learned in his recent primary fight that the economy is at the forefront of people’s minds. So while explaining the need to set aside distractions and reach a balanced approach to deal with national fiscal issues, the Democratic congressman tried to set straight President Barack Obama’s record on taxes. "We need tax cuts, there’s no question about it," Pascrell said in a July 18 interview on C-SPAN’s Washington Journal. But, he said, "this president has not raised taxes. He has not raised taxes ... and I haven't agreed with the president on everything, even as a Democrat, but he has not raised taxes. There have been so many myths about this presidency and they need to be clarified and maybe we'll do that during the election." Has Obama really not raised taxes? Thomas Pietrykoski, Pascrell’s spokesman, said the congressman was "referring to the overall effective tax rate for American families." Our colleagues at PolitiFact National found last year that for the average middle-class family, the effective tax rate -- how much the average taxpayer pays as a percentage of his income -- fell between 2008 and 2011. But Pascrell didn’t make that distinction in the interview. And Obama has raised some taxes. Obama earned a False last year from PolitiFact National for saying he "didn’t raise taxes once." Soon after taking office the president signed a bill that increased the federal excise tax on tobacco products. That tax hike went into effect in 2009. Then Obama signed the health care law, formally known as the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act but often called ObamaCare. That law includes several tax increases, some of which have not yet gone into effect, though some are in place now. For example, individuals who use indoor tanning services started paying a 10 percent tax in 2010. Other taxes in the law -- such as additional Medicare taxes of 0.9 percent on individuals who make more than $200,000 and couples that make more than $250,000 -- don’t go into effect until Jan. 1, 2013 or later. And then there’s the individual mandate, a linchpin of the health care law that will require people who forego health insurance coverage to pay a fine. The U.S. Supreme Court said in a decision upholding most of the law that the mandate "may reasonably be characterized as a tax" and that "it is reasonable to construe" it as a tax. Though these tax hikes may be relatively narrow in scope, they are examples of taxes increasing under Obama. But Obama has also cut taxes. The president said in 2011 that he "lowered taxes over the last two years." That statement earned a Mostly True from PolitiFact National. The president’s stimulus bill included the "Making Work Pay" tax credit, which was intended to offset payroll taxes. The credit gave up to $400 for working individuals and up to $800 for married taxpayers filing joint returns in 2009 and 2010. Also, Obama and Congress reached a deal in 2010 to lower payroll taxes by 2 percent for one year. The reduced tax rate was later extended through the end of this year. The tax cuts impacted a broader group, while the tax increases have had a more narrow reach. Nevertheless, some taxes have still increased under Obama. Our ruling Pascrell said "this president has not raised taxes." Some taxes have increased during Obama’s time in the White House. In his first months in office, Obama increased the federal excise tax on tobacco products and the national health care law includes a number of tax increases. It’s also true that other taxes -- such as payroll taxes -- have been reduced during the president’s tenure. However, it’s wrong to broadly state that Obama has not raised taxes.

pomt-04446	Says Obama promised unemployment would never go above 8 percent.	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/oct/11/paul-ryan/ryan-obama-promised-unemployment-would-not-exceed-/	Seated a few feet apart in their lone debate, Wisconsin Rep. Paul Ryan and Vice President Joe Biden jousted over how to boost the economy. Ryan sought to brand President Barack Obama’s recession remedies as a failure and said the president had broken his promise to keep unemployment below 8 percent. "They passed the stimulus. The idea that we could borrow $831 billion, spend it on all of these special interest groups, and that it would work out just fine, that unemployment would never get to 8 percent -- it went up above 8 percent for 43 months. They said that, right now, if we just passed this stimulus, the economy would grow at 4 percent. It's growing at 1.3. The claim that Obama said unemployment would not exceed 8 percent is one we’ve heard before. A super PAC ad took it even further, saying Obama promised unemployment topping out at 5.6 percent. But we've found these claims contain only a grain of truth. Projection vs. promise The source for Ryan’s statement -- and others like it -- is a Jan. 9, 2009, report called "The Job Impact of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Plan" from Christina Romer, then chairwoman of the president's Council of Economic Advisers, and Jared Bernstein, the vice president's top economic adviser. Their report projected that the economic stimulus plan would create 3 to 4 million jobs by the end of 2010. It also included a chart predicting unemployment rates with and without the stimulus. Without the stimulus (the baseline), unemployment was projected to hit about 8.5 percent in 2009 and then continue rising to a peak of about 9 percent in 2010. With the stimulus, they predicted the unemployment rate would peak at just under 8 percent in 2009. The important word here is projection. The economic analysis wasn’t a promise, it was an educated assessment of how events might unfold. And it came with heavy disclaimers. "It should be understood that all of the estimates presented in this memo are subject to significant margins of error," the report states. "There is the more fundamental uncertainty that comes with any estimate of the effects of a program. Our estimates of economic relationships and rules of thumb are derived from historical experience and so will not apply exactly in any given episode. Furthermore, the uncertainty is surely higher than normal now because the current recession is unusual both in its fundamental causes and its severity." There's also a footnote that goes along with the chart stating: "Forecasts of the unemployment rate without the recovery plan vary substantially. Some private forecasters anticipate unemployment rates as high as 11% in the absence of action." Republicans have also cited a speech from then President-Elect Obama about the stimulus. But Obama’s speech also presents the report’s findings as "projections," and later says that a stimulus plan would "likely" save or create 3 million to 4 million jobs. Only then does he simplify his language to say, "we’ll create" as he talks about a focus on jobs in energy, health care and infrastructure. Here’s how he sets it up: "I asked my nominee for Chair of the Council of Economic Advisers, Dr. Christina Romer, and the Vice President-Elect's Chief Economic Adviser, Dr. Jared Bernstein, to conduct a rigorous analysis of this plan and come up with projections of how many jobs it will create — and what kind of jobs they will be. Today, I am releasing a report of their findings so that the American people can see exactly what this plan will mean for their families, their communities, and our economy. The report confirms that our plan will likely save or create three to four million jobs." As we now know, as the pair prepared their estimates, the economy was already far worse than the best numbers at the time captured. The unemployment rate hit 8 percent even before Obama signed a stimulus package into law in February 2009. It peaked at just over 10 percent in early 2010 and has decreased very slowly. In September, it fell to 7.8 percent, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Our ruling Ryan said the Obama administration promised "unemployment would never get to 8 percent." Obama didn’t say that. Rather, his Council of Economic Advisers predicted that the stimulus would hold it to that level. Their report included heavy disclaimers that the projections had "significant margins of error" and a high degree of uncertainty due to a recession that is "unusual both in its fundamental causes and its severity." The sub-8 percent prediction did not hold true, but it’s still incorrect to characterize it as a promise or guarantee. We rate Ryan’s statement Mostly False.

pomt-01289	Wisconsin Republicans "repealed a statewide fair pay law" that made "sure women are treated fairly on the job."	mostly true	/wisconsin/statements/2014/oct/31/barack-obama/wisconsin-republicans-repealed-equal-pay-law-prote/	Seeking to boost voter turnout among Democrats, President Barack Obama campaigned for Wisconsin gubernatorial hopeful Mary Burke one week before the November election. At one point during his Oct. 28, 2014, appearance at Milwaukee’s North Division High School, Obama focused his remarks on women. And without mentioning Gov. Scott Walker by name, the president made a claim about equal pay and Republicans that we want to check. "We believe that America is stronger when women are full and equal participants in the economy," Obama said, according to a transcript from The White House. "In 2012, Republicans here in Wisconsin repealed a statewide fair-pay law. Now think about that. Just like I don’t understand why somebody would be against somebody having health insurance, I don’t understand -- why would you want to repeal a law to make sure women are treated fairly on the job? That’s your platform? That’s your agenda? Earlier this year -- it don’t make no sense." So, Obama's claim is that Wisconsin Republicans "repealed a statewide fair-pay law" that made "sure women are treated fairly on the job." That’s similar to a statement made by the liberal Greater Wisconsin Committee in a TV ad attacking Walker. Let’s check what the president said. Previous factcheck We covered much of this ground when Burke claimed that Walker’s repeal of a 2009 law left Wisconsin as one of five states "without an equal pay law protecting women from gender discrimination in their paycheck." We rated her claim -- which goes much further than Obama’s -- as False. Here’s what we found: The law Obama alluded to was the Equal Pay Enforcement Act. It was adopted in 2009 when Democrats controlled state government, then repealed in 2012 after Walker was elected and his fellow Republicans won the majority in the Legislature. The 2009 law allowed equal-pay claims to be filed as lawsuits in state court (such suits in federal court were already allowed and continue to be). That meant women claiming pay discrimination could potentially collect more money -- compensatory and punitive damages -- through state court, which some employee attorneys contend is easier and less expensive than suing in federal court. Previously, at the state level, they could only file a complaint with a state agency and potentially collect back wages and legal expenses. That approach remains. So, Obama is correct that Republicans repealed a fair-pay law. And that law was aimed at ensuring that women were treated fairly on the job. But Obama's claim could leave the impression that the repeal meant Wisconsin had no equal-pay law, when in fact it still does. Unaffected by the Republicans' repeal is the state's Fair Employment Act, which has been in place since 1982. It explicitly prohibits gender-based employment discrimination "in promotion (and) compensation paid for equal or substantially similar work." It allows people who believe they’ve faced pay discrimination to seek back wages and legal fees -- smaller damages than they might get in state court -- from their employers through a state administrative hearing process. And there is also the option to sue in federal court. Our rating Obama said Wisconsin Republicans "repealed a statewide fair-pay law" that made "sure women are treated fairly on the job." Walker and the GOP-led Legislature did repeal an law that provided more assurance -- through stiffer penalties against employers available in state court -- that women are treated fairly. But there is still a state law that allows women to win smaller damages for unequal pay through an administrative hearing process. For a statement that is accurate but needs more information, our rating is Mostly True. To comment on this item, go to the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel’s web page.

pomt-03493	"Black children constitute 18 percent of the nation's public school population but 40 percent of the children who are suspended or expelled."	mostly true	/georgia/statements/2013/jun/10/john-lewis/do-numbers-show-black-students-disciplined-higher-/	In the 1960s, John Lewis marched for racial equality. Lewis, now a veteran congressman from Atlanta, recently used another approach to voice his criticism concerning what he sees as another form of racial injustice. Lewis, a Democrat, co-wrote an op-ed that focused on his belief that African-Americans are being treated unfairly in the criminal justice system. The problem starts early, wrote Lewis and Bryan Stevenson, who teaches law at New York University. "Black children constitute 18 percent of the nation's public school population but 40 percent of the children who are suspended or expelled," they wrote. PolitiFact Georgia read the op-ed and wondered about the statistics they used to back up their argument. Are 40 percent of students suspended or expelled in America’s public schools black? We recently examined another statement in their op-ed that claimed the violent crime rate in America was the same since 1968, but the prison system had grown by 500 percent. We rated that statement Half True. Brenda Jones, a spokeswoman for Lewis, said Stevenson culled the information from a U.S. Department of Education online warehouse of school suspensions and expulsions. Jones said they relied on a 2009-2010 survey to come up with the numbers and a 2012 Children’s Defense Fund report on the subject. "The results from the schools surveyed show public school systems where Black students represented 18 percent of students but 46 percent of those suspended more than once and 39 percent of those expelled," Jones said in one email. U.S. Department of Education researchers looked at 85 percent of the nation’s public school students in some 72,000 schools in a widely publicized report released in March 2012. They found although black students made up 18 percent of the nation’s public school population, they accounted for 35 percent of students suspended at least once and 39 percent of students expelled. The study also examined student readiness for college and careers, retention, and other issues. U.S. Education Secretary Arne Duncan said the findings highlighted the need for educators to address the disparities. "The power of the data is not only in the numbers themselves, but in the impact it can have when married with the courage and the will to change. The undeniable truth is that the everyday educational experience for many students of color violates the principle of equity at the heart of the American promise," said Duncan, who is white. "It is our collective duty to change that." The Children’s Defense Fund cited the Education Department study in a 2013 report on how many Mississippi public school students ended up in prison, writing that 38 percent of students suspended nationwide were African-Americans. Some critics of the report complained Duncan and much of the news media focused exclusively on black students and wrongly assumed that the disproportionate percentage of those students being suspended or expelled was a result of institutional racism. "The feds have reached their conclusions, however, without answering the obvious question: Are black students suspended more often because they misbehave more?" Heather MacDonald, a well-known author, commentator and columnist who is white, wrote shortly after the report was released. We found plenty of debate over the rationale for the higher percentage of black students suspended or expelled in that report. Again, we were focused on whether the statistics used to make the claim were accurate. We continued our research by looking at past studies to see whether the numbers in that report were a one-time spike. In a 2006 federal study, black students made up 37.4 percent of those suspended from school. White students were slightly ahead, accounting for 39.1 percent of those suspended. About 20 percent of the students suspended were Hispanic. Black students made up about 38 percent of expulsions in one category and 42.5 percent of expulsions in another category, the 2006 report showed. Our conclusion: Lewis co-wrote that black students make up 18 percent of the students in America’s public schools but 40 percent of students who are suspended or expelled. The percentage of the U.S. student population is accurate, while the percentage of black students suspended or expelled is pretty close to the mark. We rate this statement Mostly True.

pomt-01476	Scott Walker was elected governor on a promise not to take campaign contributions "from the date of his inauguration until the signing of the state budget," but broke it by taking nearly $5.6 million.	false	/wisconsin/statements/2014/sep/29/one-wisconsin-now/scott-walker-pledged-not-take-campaign-money-durin/	A liberal advocacy group is accusing Republican Gov. Scott Walker of breaking a campaign promise by accepting millions of dollars in campaign contributions while he crafted the state budget. One Wisconsin Now made the attack Sept. 26, 2014, less than six weeks before the election between Walker and Democrat Mary Burke. The Madison-based group began its news release with this: "In an ‘Ethics Reform Plan’ Scott Walker proposed while running for governor, he promised he would not accept contributions from the date of his inauguration until the signing of the state budget. "A review of Governor Walker’s campaign finance records by One Wisconsin Now shows that for each budget he introduced between Jan. 1 and the date the budget was signed into law, he raised nearly $5.6 million from 54,000 contributions." Our Walk-O-Meter tracks 65 promises Walker made during the 2010 campaign for governor. But none like the one described by One Wisconsin Now. Did we miss one? No. It turns out the pledge is actually from eight years ago, part of an ethics reform plan Walker issued during his brief 2006 run for the GOP nomination for governor. Saying government ethics is "one of the greatest challenges to Wisconsin's democracy," Walker vowed in that race not to accept any campaign donations from the time between the inauguration in January 2007 until the signing of the state budget. But Walker dropped out before the primary, deferring to then-Congressman Mark Green, who lost to Democratic incumbent Jim Doyle in the general election. Walker, of course, ran again for governor in 2010 and won. But we know of no campaign contribution promise made during that campaign like the one cited by One Wisconsin Now. When we posed that to Scot Ross, the group’s executive director, he argued Walker’s 2006 promise "has never been repudiated in subsequent campaigns." And he said Walker "did the opposite" of the 2006 pledge by accepting large campaign donations during the time he worked on state budget. But a campaign promise from an unsuccessful run doesn’t automatically carry over to the next campaign. And One Wisconsin Now ignores the fact Walker’s old promise specifically said it applied to the 2007 budget period. The group calculated the numbers for the 2011 and 2013 budget periods. Records from the state Government Accountability Board show Walker’s campaign received more than $6 million during the budget-preparation periods: $2.51 million from January 2011, the month he was inaugurated, through June 2011, when he signed his first state budget; and $3.52 million from January through June of 2013, the period when he and the Legislature took up his second budget. But it’s something of a moot point for this factcheck, given that Walker wasn’t elected on such a promise. Our rating One Wisconsin Now said Walker was elected governor on a promise not to take campaign contributions "from the date of his inauguration until the signing of the state budget," but broke the promise by taking nearly $5.6 million in contributions. Walker made such a promise during his failed campaign for governor in 2006, specifically noting the period would begin Jan. 3, 2007. But he did not make it again during his successful run in 2010. We rate the claim False. To comment on this item, go to the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel’s web page.	None	One Wisconsin Now	None	None	None	2014-09-29T14:49:14	2014-09-26	['None']

pomt-00009	"There is no reason for these massive, deadly and costly forest fires in California except that forest management is so poor."	false	/california/statements/2018/nov/12/donald-trump/trumps-overly-simplistic-and-false-claim-californi/	As deadly wildfires forced more than a quarter million Californians to flee their homes, President Trump recently alleged the infernos are the result of nothing more than poor "forest management." He also threatened to eliminate unspecified federal funds. The Camp fire in Northern California’s rural Butte County had killed 42 people and destroyed more than 6,400 homes as of Monday, making it the state’s most deadly and destructive fire in history. Authorities said more than 200 people remained unaccounted for. The fire started on Nov. 8, 2018 in a wooded area near the town of Paradise. Meanwhile, in Southern California, the Woolsey fire in Ventura and Los Angeles counties was blamed for the death of two people and had destroyed an estimated 435 structures. That blaze started on a suburban hillside, not a forest. In his first public comments about the fires, Trump tweeted on Nov. 10, 2018: "There is no reason for these massive, deadly and costly forest fires in California except that forest management is so poor. Billions of dollars are given each year, with so many lives lost, all because of gross mismanagement of the forests. Remedy now, or no more Fed payments!" He tweeted again on Nov. 11, 2018: "With proper Forest Management, we can stop the devastation constantly going on in California. Get Smart!" Trump’s comments drew sharp rebukes from firefighters and state officials, both for the threat to withhold funding during an emergency and for oversimplifying the reasons the fires are so destructive. In a tweet two days later, he thanked California’s firefighters and first responders. He also approved California's request for a major disaster declaration, freeing up federal aid for fire response and recovery. Given the strong reaction, we decided to fact-check the president’s contention "there is no reason" for California’s fires other than poor forest management. Our research Trump’s claim suggests the state government controls decisions over how and whether to thin forests, clear brush and set prescribed burns. In reality, California owns just 2 percent of forest land in the state, while the federal government owns upwards of 60 percent, said Keith Gilless, a UC Berkeley professor of forest economics and chairman of the California Board of Forestry and Fire Protection. The rest is owned by private landowners, timber companies and Native American tribes. Gilless said tree harvests have declined significantly on national forest lands over the past four decades due, at least in part, to legal challenges by environmentalists concerned about clear-cutting. The professor added that money spent in the past on preventing fires has been diverted to fighting them. The state has made significant investments in forest management, he said, but "has no leverage" over the federal government to do the same. In August, McClatchy reported the Trump administration "proposed slashing tens of millions of dollars" for tree clearing. Gilless added that Trump’s tweet ignores additional key factors driving California’s recent "firestorms," such as winds reaching near 60 miles per hour and bone dry conditions. With those extremes, "even good preparation can be overcome," he said. "I think the biggest problem with the comments was the lack of nuance," Gilless said, describing them as "uninformed." "It is a complex situation. Simple pronouncements on a subject like this are almost always in error." Asked about Trump’s tweets in an interview on CNN, California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection Deputy Chief Scott McLean declined to respond directly, citing "the lack of information given in that tweet." He went on to describe California’s changing weather patterns. "What’s been pushing all the fires these last couple years? The winds. The erratic wind behavior. The high temperatures early in the year that have dried out all this vegetation," McLean said. Fire and climate experts also say the trend of more people moving into wildland areas increases the chances of sparking forest fires. Jesse Miller, an ecologist who studies wildfires and lectures at Stanford University, described Trump’s comments as "off base and not capturing the complexity of the situation." "Forest management might be part of the issue, but those are mostly federal lands up there (where the Camp fire started east of Chico). So, (Trump’s) actually in charge of most of those lands. … He’s also not recognizing the role of climate change. That’s by far what I and a lot of people think is the biggest factor driving these fires right now in California." The White House did not respond to a request for evidence supporting Trump’s tweet. Our ruling President Trump claimed in a tweet "there is no reason" for California’s deadly fires other than poor "forest management." Forestry and climate experts say forest management, which includes thinning out forests, setting prescribed burns and clearing brush, is only one factor. But it’s not the only one, and not necessarily the driving force in the state’s recent firestorms. California’s stronger winds, higher temperatures and drier conditions driven by climate change are also making the fires worse. That’s in addition to the fact that more people now live in forested areas, increasing the chances of sparking an inferno. Trump erroneously places the blame on just one factor, while ignoring these other reasons for California’s devastating fires. We rate his oversimplified claim False.

pomt-10733	Huckabee "was one of the highest taxing governors that we had in this country and rivaling Bill Clinton in terms of the Cato ratings."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2007/nov/14/fred-thompson/yes-he-raised-taxes-and-scored-low/	Thompson is correct that Huckabee is not exactly a darling of fiscal conservatives. When he became governor of Arkansas in 1996, Huckabee touted his aversion to taxes. But over the next 10 years, he became increasingly willing to compromise with the state's Democratic-led legislature on fiscal issues. Thompson cites information from the Cato Institute, a conservative think tank that issues biannual "Report Cards" for governors, based on their tax and spending records. In 1998, two years into his governorship, Huckabee received a B from Cato, which praised him for instituting a large, broad-based tax cut package in the previous year. However, Huckabee's Cato grade steadily dropped from there: The group gave him C's in 2000 and 2002, a D in 2004 and finally, as Thompson states, an F in 2006. In its report last year, the organization declared that Huckabee "went from being one of the best governors in America to one of the worst. ... The main reason for the drop was his insistence on raising taxes at almost every turn throughout his final term." Because of this drop, they gave him a grade of D for his 10-year career as governor. His tax increases included the state sales tax (more than once) as well as a cigarette and tobacco tax and a tax on nursing home beds. Huckabee's careerlong grade does, as Thompson states, match the D Bill Clinton earned in 1992, his last year as Arkansas' governor. Here's one last bit of context. It's worth noting that the fiscal reports done by Cato factor in spending policy as well as tax history, according to Stephen Slivinski, who produces the fiscal report cards. In 2006, Slivinski's team gave Huckabee the lowest grade of any governor when it came to tax policy. Thompson called Huckabee "one of the highest taxing governors," and it's hard to dispute that. Again, though, as a point of clarification, that doesn't mean Arkansas has the nation's highest tax burden. According to the Tax Foundation, a nonprofit research organization, Arkansans have the 13th-highest state and local tax burden in the nation — that is, however, a significant jump from the No. 30 spot the state held when Huckabee became governor.

pomt-00255	Says three research universities "came out and said (CPS is) the best public school system in the United States of a major urban system."	mostly false	/illinois/statements/2018/oct/05/rahm-emanuel/emanuel-exaggerates-what-studies-say-about-cps/	Rahm Emanuel recently announced he won’t seek a third term as Chicago’s mayor, but he has continued to tout the city’s accolades, including recognition received in recent years for its improvements to public education. Last fall, we rated Mostly True a claim from a Chicago Public Schools press release that said its students were learning at a faster rate than their counterparts in 96 percent of U.S. school districts. That claim was based on findings from Stanford University that CPS students had improved at a faster rate on standardized test scores between third and eighth grade in recent years than their counterparts in most other U.S. school districts. But the report also noted that third- through eighth-graders in the nation’s third-largest district still perform below the national average, something the district’s glowing press release did not reflect. So we were curious what the mayor was referring to when he claimed a new title for CPS at a recent event: best among the nation’s largest districts. "30 years ago ... William Bennett, Ronald Reagan's Secretary of Education, called the Chicago Public Schools the worst in the United States," Emanuel said while answering a question from an audience member at a forum hosted in Chicago by the New York-based Fortune magazine. "Stanford, University of Chicago and the University of Illinois Chicago: all three, independently over 18 months came out and said it’s the best public school system in the United States of a major urban system." Adam Collins, a spokesman for the mayor, pointed us to studies from each university that he said backed up the mayor’s claim. "Reports from Stanford, the University of Chicago and the University of Illinois Chicago all identify CPS students as having the fastest growing or the highest attainment in the matter and context covered within each study," Collins wrote in an email. The Stanford report, from education equality expert Sean Reardon, was the same one CPS based its claim on last year. Reardon found Chicago had the highest test score growth rate between third and eighth grade of any large district in the nation. But nowhere does the report label CPS "the best" among large urban districts. "We compared Chicago to the 100 largest school districts on measures of test score growth but not on other factors," Reardon said in a phone interview. The University of Chicago report cited by Emanuel’s office, which assessed college enrollment patterns among CPS graduates, was less analogous. It said the district’s four-year college enrollment rate of 44 percent exceeded that of New York City, Los Angeles, and Dallas and called the district "a national leader in creating initiatives to support students in the transition to college." But like the Stanford report, it did not go so far as to crown CPS’ school system the best overall among similar districts. It also noted that CPS’ community college enrollment rate was lower than rates for other urban school systems. The UIC report, meanwhile, found Chicago elementary students were outperforming their peers in the rest of the state on standardized tests in comparisons between demographically similar groups. But the study was limited to Illinois, meaning no other major urban districts were included. For national context, however, UIC researcher Paul Zavitkovsky did refer to Reardon’s report. Zavitkovsky also pointed us to Chicago’s recent performance on the National Assessment of Educational Progress, where the district’s eighth graders scored slightly above the 2017 average for large cities, ranking lower than three other major urban districts in both reading and math but higher in those subjects than more than a dozen others, including Los Angeles, D.C. and Dallas. "I think the thing that’s fairest to say is that Chicago has made more progress toward school effectiveness than any large district in the country," Zavitkovsky said, adding that although academics must carefully define the terms of their research, the "spirit" of what the mayor said at the Fortune event was correct. Reardon took a similar view, noting that defining "best" remains something of an open question when it comes to evaluating school systems, complicated by the challenge of finding other measures of school quality tracked by all districts. He also pointed to college enrollment as another useful data point for making such an assessment. That context was missing entirely from the mayor’s remarks, however. Reardon’s research showing CPS students are improving the fastest among large districts comes closest to what Emanuel claimed. But even then, that’s far less emphatic than labeling CPS the best urban school system overall. Our ruling Emanuel said Stanford, the University of Chicago and the University of Illinois at Chicago all pronounced CPS "the best public school system in the United States of a major urban system." The mayor’s blanket assertion contains an element of truth — and some very good news — in that reports from all three universities underscored significant strides the district has made and ranked CPS at or near top of the list on certain measures of performance. But Emanuel dispensed with all the nuance in proclaiming CPS the "best" overall among big city districts, a declaration beyond the scope of any of the academic studies he cited to underpin his boast.

pomt-01283	Says U.S. Senate candidate Michelle Nunn was "handpicked" by President Barack Obama	half-true	/georgia/statements/2014/nov/01/david-perdue/democrats-want-nunn-know-she-will-often-oppose-the/	Democrat Michelle Nunn is running a close race against Republican David Perdue for Georgia’s open U.S. Senate seat. Perdue, the cousin of former Gov. Sonny Perdue, has made no bones that he doesn’t think the election is between him and Nunn, the daughter of longtime U.S. Senator Sam Nunn. In the race that could determine which party controls the Senate, Perdue has said that his real opponent is Barack Obama, a Democratic president with low approval ratings in Georgia. Obama "handpicked her. He funded her. He supports her," Perdue said in an Oct. 7 debate in Perry. "You will not bite the hand that feeds you." Perdue continued the theme in an Oct. 26 debate in Atlanta. When asked to pose a question to Nunn, he said, "Isn’t a vote for you just a vote for Barack Obama?" Implicit in Perdue’s effort to link Nunn with Obama is the often repeated charge that Nunn will be a rubber stamp for the president if she is elected. But Nunn has cited several areas where she disagrees with the president and reiterated that she will be a problem-solver and pragmatist in the Senate. "No one is feeding me by hand, David. I’ve spent maybe 45 minutes out of my entire life with President Obama," she said at the debate. "I do not agree with the president as some sort of rubber stamp." The back-and-forth could be political rhetoric. But with so much on the line nationally, PolitiFact Georgia wondered: did the president hand-pick Nunn with the expectation she would blindly support his policies? We began by asking the Perdue campaign for the basis for its claim. Spokesman Derrick Dickey cited not the president but two potential proxies: Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid and the group Organizing for Action, or OFA. Reid did single out Nunn as "really good" in a July 2013 speech to OFA, Obama’s political arm. "The president is only as strong as his Congress," Reid said. "I talked with Michelle Nunn today. I think there will be an important announcement out of Georgia tomorrow." Nunn declared her candidacy on July 22, 2013. She consulted with the Democratic Senatorial Senate Campaign Committee before throwing her name into the ring, according to published reports. But she and her father have both said in interviews that Reid actually asked her not to run for the seat. Congressman John Barrow, a conservative Democrat running for re-election in the 12th District, was mentioned as a possible candidate instead for the seat of retiring U.S. Sen. Saxby Chambliss. The DSCC did not respond to repeated requests for comment. Barrow spokesman Richard Carbo said the congressman had reviewed requests for a Senate run but in May 2013 announced he would stick with his initial House re-election plans. "He ultimately decided that he could continue to be an asset to the people in the 12th District and the entire state in the House of Representatives," Carbo said. A DSCC poll, released by the political website Politico.com a day after Barrow’s announcement, lends credibility to Nunn being the preferred candidate. The poll shows Nunn would fare better than Barrow against the then-presumptive GOP nominee, U.S. Rep. Jack Kingston. Dickey also notes that OFA committed to directing donors and money to Nunn’s campaign – the first such political effort for the group meant to be non-partisan. Since then, the president has told an Atlanta radio station that a Nunn victory in the race "means that Democrats keep control of the Senate" and his wife, Michelle Obama, headlined a fund-raiser for Nunn. "There is no doubt that Barack Obama and his allies picked Michelle Nunn to be the Democrat nominee and attempted to influence the outcome of the primary election on her behalf," Dickey said. Such ties may give Perdue an opening – but they don’t translate into Nunn walking in lockstep with Obama, or even the national Democratic Party. Nunn, for instance, has long bucked her party in calling for immediate action to build the Keystone Pipeline. Notably, that puts Nunn in the corner of only one prominent Democrat – fellow Southerner Mary Landrieu of Louisiana. She has pushed for reversing cuts to military spending, notably opposing Obama’s proposed cut to the A-10 Warthogs. She also criticized Obama for delaying funding and authorization to deepen the Port of Savannah. "Perdue's claim is ludicrous," Nunn spokesman Nathan Click said. "The fact is that since the beginning of this race, Michelle has been very clear that she is running to fight for Georgians and bring Georgia values on Washington -- not kowtow to party leaders." To that end, being the preferred candidate means only adding to the number of senators with a D after their name, not sharing all ideology, said Kerwin Swint, the director of the political science department at Kennesaw State University. Nunn has been clear she does support some of the party’s policies. She is for raising the minimum wage and has given support to Obamacare, with some changes. But it’s unlikely she could be a rubber stamp, or would even want to be, given the state’s politics, Swint said. "In a state like Georgia, you’d expect her to take a more conservative stance," Swint said. "She’s a moderate Democrat in a Southern state. Democrats would welcome her with open arms, knowing full well she’s going to have serious disagreements with them." Our ruling So, where does that leave us with Perdue’s claim? There is strong evidence that Democratic leaders – if not the president himself – made it clear that they preferred Nunn as the party’s nominee in Georgia. But Nunn’s stated opposition to some of Obama’s key policies supports the idea that she would not be a rubber stamp for the president. Perdue has a point about Nunn’s selection by top Democrats. But it needs a lot of additional information to be fully understood. We rate the claim Half True.	None	David Perdue	None	None	None	2014-11-01T00:00:00	2014-10-07	['None']
pomt-10624	"I have never asked for nor received a single earmark or pork barrel project for my state."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/jan/15/john-mccain/there-are-a-few-blips-on-the-record/	Responding to a question about the Bush tax cuts, Sen. John McCain boldly touted a perfect record against wasteful pork barrel spending at a Jan. 6, 2008, debate in New Hampshire. "... If we're going to restore the confidence of the American people and our Republican base first, we're going to have to cut the spending, we're going to have to eliminate the pork barrel and wasteful spending," McCain said. "And I'm proud to tell you, Chris, in 24 years as a member of Congress, I have never asked for nor received a single earmark or pork barrel project for my state and I guarantee you I'll veto those (spending) bills." McCain definitely holds claim to the title of pork-fighter, according to Taxpayers for Common Sense. The Washington-based group watches for wasteful spending and has consistently lauded McCain as a champion of its causes, honoring him with its "Treasury Guardians" award. But holding a perfect record during a quarter-century of congressional spending isn't easy. Even a cursory review shows a few blips in his background: • In 2006, McCain co-sponsored with fellow Arizona Republican Sen. Jon Kyl a bill that asked for $10-million for an academic center at the University of Arizona named in honor of William Rehnquist, the former U.S. Supreme Court chief justice. The project died in committee. • In 2003, he advocated and won authorization to buy property to create a buffer zone around Luke Air Force Base in Arizona, a project requested by the Air Force but not the president. • In 1992, he wrote a letter to the head of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency requesting that the "EPA either reprogram $5-million out of existing funds or earmark the amount from an appropriate account" for a wastewater project in Nogales, Ariz., according to documents obtained by the Washington Post. The EPA administrator, William K. Reilly, said it wasn't doable. Whether these projects constitute earmarked pork depends on how you look at the issue. In its simplest form, pork barrel spending is a project designed to benefit a particular constituency, and an earmark is the designation of funds for a specific purpose. "I find items that would certainly look like parochial spending to many folks but it's hard to call them earmarks in the traditional sense of the definition," said Pete Sepp, a spokesman with the National Taxpayers Union. McCain has his own more nuanced definition, as do the various groups that track wasteful spending by Congress. "I take the approach that Justice Potter Stewart did in the Supreme Court decision about pornography," said Steve Ellis, with Taxpayers for Common Sense. "I can't quite define it but I know it when I see it." Ellis said McCain has a clear position against earmarks during his career. "None of those really rise to the traditional, largely accepted definition of earmarks," he said. "I think he's on pretty firm ground." McCain spokesman Brian Rogers defined congressional earmarks as "the practice of legislators designating the appropriation of money to specific unauthorized projects without the scrutiny of the congressional authorization process," he wrote in an e-mail. McCain's campaign points to the Rehnquist Center as the standard for how individual appropriations should be requested: stand-alone legislation that gets congressional study. "The bill did not pass, John McCain did not seek an earmarked appropriation for the center and the result was no funding for this center," Rogers said. With the Air Force base, McCain's camp said he argued for the authorization but the appropriations committee funded it. Rogers said the wastewater facility McCain sought was in the president's fiscal year 1993 budget. When the administrator said the agency couldn't meet the need from existing funds, Rogers added, the senator did not seek an earmark in an appropriations bill. However, McCain did write a letter with Kyl in October 2007 asking the EPA to include the money in its budget request. Again the EPA left it out, so Kyl — not McCain — put an earmark in the 2008 omnibus spending bill. "Senator McCain has been a consistent opponent of unauthorized congressional earmarks and pork-barrel spending," Rogers concluded. Such an assertion seems to rely heavily on interpretation — which runs counter to McCain's unequivocal statement at the debate. "To the average person on the outside world, there might not be much of a difference with these things," Sepp said. Indeed, we agree with Sepp that the narrow Washington definition of "earmark" is less important than the impression McCain has left. It appears he was seeking pork barrel projects for Arizona, which puts a few blemishes on an otherwise pure record against pork. And so while we find there is no question that McCain has been a leading congressional voice against pork, these three examples conflict with his bold claim. So we find that claim False.

pomt-05260	Says he "earned the highest possible credit ratings as state treasurer."	mostly true	/ohio/statements/2012/may/31/josh-mandel/josh-mandel-campaign-claims-he-earned-highest-poss/	Josh Mandel's new campaign ad "Change" uses about half of its 30 seconds to attack Sherrod Brown, the incumbent Democratic senator he hopes to unseat. For the remainder of the time, the ad touts Mandel’s record as the Republican state treasurer. Mandel, the ad says, "earned the highest possible credit ratings as state treasurer." That had a familiar ring to it, so PolitiFact Ohio decided to check it out. This is the second claim PolitiFact Ohio has looked at from this ad. We previously rated as False a claim that Brown "cast the deciding vote on a government takeover of health care." One of the treasurer's responsibilities is to invest money for local governments through the STAR (State Treasury Asset Reserve) Ohio investment fund, an investment pool with assets of more than $4.1 billion. The Mandel campaign confirmed that the claim in the ad refers to the AAA rating that Standard & Poor’s gave the STAR Ohio fund. It confirmed that rating in a letter to the state last August. Mandel made a similar claim in an email to supporters last October, saying then that the fund "just received the highest possible credit rating one of these funds can receive." PolitiFact Ohio rated that claim Half True. We found that the statement's wording, especially that the fund "just" received its rating, gave the impression that the rating had improved under Mandel. In fact, the rating had been in place for 16 years -- since 1995, the first year the fund was rated by S&P. Public finance experts said the treasurer did deserve some credit for maintaining that rating. Kevin O’Brien, executive director at the Center for Public Management in the Maxine Goodman Levin College of Urban Affairs at Cleveland State University, noted then that the highest praise should be reserved for the fund managers who maintained the rating during the financial crisis in 2008. Mandel deserves credit for maintaining the rating his staff inherited when he took office in January 2011, said O’Brien, a former financial analyst for Moody’s Investors Service, another credit rating agency. "They maintained the bond rating; they didn't achieve the bond rating." The claim in the new ad, though similar to the email claim, is more carefully worded. It does not imply that the state’s rating had "just" improved. But knowing the credit rating has been at that level for more than a decade and a half provides a clearer picture. Mandel’s statement is accurate but needs additional information to provide clarification. On the Truth-O-Meter, the claim rates Mostly True.

pomt-04497	Says "Portland has higher standards than feds on allowed police use of force."	true	/oregon/statements/2012/oct/05/sam-adams/are-portlands-use-force-standards-stricter-federal/	The Portland City Council's decision to fight the mandated rehiring of Portland police officer Ron Frashour -- the man responsible for the 2010 fatal shooting of Aaron Campbell -- has again stoked public discussion about use of force. Central to the Frashour case is the question of whether the officer used the proper level of force in his interactions with Campbell two years ago. Frashour was initially fired after shooting an unarmed Campbell in the back, though a Multnomah County grand jury had found no criminal wrongdoing. The case then went to an arbitrator who heard training officers testify that Frashour acted as trained. The city is fighting that determination and the controversy over the policy and Frashour’s actions has stayed hot. In a small Twitter dust up, one user (@nextchampjr) asked Mayor Sam Adams if he thought the federal standard for use of force, which the arbiter found Frashour met, ought to be reworked. The mayor replied that, in fact, "Portland has higher standards than feds on allowed police use of force." We wondered whether that was accurate. Before we get to our analysis, we note that we’re staying out of the debate over how Frashour was trained, and how well. We are only examining the policy. First, we needed to establish the generally accepted federal standard. Such a standard exists, but not in quite the way you might expect. There’s no series of agreed-upon federal guidelines that lay out exactly what sort of force can be used in a specific instance. Instead there’s a legal term called the Graham Standard or the Objective Reasonableness Standard. Back in 1989, the United States Supreme Court ruled in Graham v. Connor that any questions regarding the use of force should be held to the Fourth Amendment rules of "reasonableness." Essentially, this means that any use of force should be such that it would be deemed necessary by "a reasonable officer." "When we say reasonable, it's an objective standard," explains Tung Yin, a criminal law professor at Lewis and Clark. "You judge it from the perspective of the reasonable officer on the scene." This caused some controversy at the time the case was decided because whether you perceive force as reasonable in the heat of the moment -- which is the standard -- is often different than how you perceive it after the fact, Yin said. So, how is Portland’s policy different? Caryn Brooks, the mayor's spokeswoman, pointed us to Portland Police Policy 1010.20. According to that policy, adopted by former Police Chief Rosie Sizer, officers should use "only the force reasonably necessary under the totality of circumstances to perform their duties and resolve confrontations effectively and safely." That piece just gets the bureau in line with the legal standards. But the policy also adds these two pieces of direction: 1) "It is the policy of the Bureau to accomplish its mission as effectively as possible with as little reliance on force as practical." 2) "The Bureau expects members to develop and display, over the course of their practice of law enforcement, the skills and abilities that allow them to regularly resolve confrontations without resorting to the higher levels of allowable force." Yin described this text as more "aspirational text, rather than any sort of legal requirement" but said he felt the mayor’s characterization was accurate. We agree with Yin. We rate this claim True.

pomt-07810	Limiting labor negotiations to only wages is "how it is for the most part in the private sector."	false	/wisconsin/statements/2011/feb/17/alberta-darling/wisconsin-state-sen-alberta-darling-says-unions-pr/	A key argument for Gov. Scott Walker’s plan to strip Wisconsin public employees of most of their bargaining rights is pretty simple: The budget is tight, and they’ve got sweetheart deals you don’t find in the private sector. If the move is approved by the GOP-controlled Legislature, the state employees would be forced to pay more for pension contributions and health care coverage. As it stands, Walker’s bill would essentially leave only wages to be discussed at the bargaining table -- and those raises would generally be limited by the rate of inflation. As Republican leaders fanned out to defend the bill, state Sen. Alberta Darling, R-River Hills, appeared on WISN-TV’s "Upfront with Mike Gousha" on Feb. 13, 2011. She is co-chairman of the powerful Joint Finance Committee, the first stop for the bill. She began her comments by agreeing with Gousha about the scope of the proposals, which have stirred massive protests at the Capitol -- "It’s huge." -- and went on to say it was important that public employees pay their "fair share," just like workers in the private sector. Darling added, "The governor is proposing that we have collective bargaining deal only with wages which is how it is, for the most part, in the private sector." That didn’t sound right to us. Walker’s bill would rewrite the state Employment Relations Act -- a law covering state employees that is more than 50 years old and was last amended in 1971. But private sector unions are covered by a federal law and generally bargain on all sorts of things. We tried to reach Darling to ask for her backup, but she didn’t respond. So we turned to some experts who are involved in private sector labor relations. And we took a look at federal law, the National Labor Relations Act,which governs most private employers. According to this overview on the National Labor Relations Board website: "Congress enacted the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA) in 1935 to protect the rights of employees and employers, to encourage collective bargaining, and to curtail certain private sector labor and management practices, which can harm the general welfare of workers, businesses and the U.S. economy." The law gives workers the right to bargain collectively for a contract that sets wages, benefits, hours and other working conditions, the NLRA says. The law also requires workers and employers to "bargain in good faith about wages, hours, vacation time, insurance, safety practices and other mandatory subjects." That covers a lot more than wages. To see how it plays out on a practical level, we checked in with some folks on both sides of the bargaining table. Candice Owley, president Wisconsin Federation of Nurses and Health Professionals, said wages are only part of what’s important to nurses when they negotiate with hospitals. Her union represents about 3,000 nurses, about half of whom are employed at private facilities. "We spend very little time these days on wages and a whole lot of time on working conditions," she said, such as seniority, schedules, the length of shifts, and what happens when a nurse is assigned to a different department. Said Owley: "We bargain every kind of working condition imaginable." James R. Scott, a Milwaukee laywer who represents management. His firm, Linder & Marsack, has about 80 percent private sector work. "That’s not true," he said of Darling’s statement. "The standard is that you can bargain about everything that affects wages, hours and working conditions." Scott noted that recent high profile negotiations have involved concessions from workers at companies such as Harley-Davidson, Kohler and Mercury Marine. All of those manufacturers recently sought, and won, contracts that included two-tiered wage structures, the use of temporary workers and other changes that will reduce labor costs. With the companies reeling from the recession, the union members voted for changes that saved their jobs from being moved to other states. "When you’re in concession bargaining it tends to be about money," Scott said, but added that unions "are not prevented from making a non-economic proposal." Rick Badger, executive director of AFSCME District Council 40, whose membership is largely public employees, but includes some private sector workers. In the cases of Harley and other manufacturers, "really drastic measures were taken to some jobs, but the unions still exist," Badger said. He said future talks will, of course, include discussions of benefits, schedules and other matters. "All of these things are negotiated," Badger said. "You sit down and come up with solutions. It’s not just money, it’s the workplace." Let’s return to Darling’s statement. In arguing public employee unions ought to be treated more like their their private sector counterparts, she said "for the most part" private contract talks are limited to wages. However, the National Labor Relations Act make it clear: Private employers with unions are not only allowed to bargain on many other issues -- that law requires the subjects be about far more than just wages. We rate her statement False.	None	Alberta Darling	None	None	None	2011-02-17T15:30:31	2011-02-13	['None']

pomt-01330	Ed Gillespie’s "firm even lobbied for five foreign governments, including a dictator now awaiting trial for war crimes."	half-true	/virginia/statements/2014/oct/24/mark-warner/warner-says-gillespies-firm-lobbied-brutal-dictato/	A new ad by U.S. Sen. Mark Warner tags Republican challenger Ed Gillespie as "million dollar lobbyist" and links him to a notorious client. "His firm even lobbied for five foreign governments, including a dictator now awaiting trial for war crimes," narrator says. We decided to take a look. The dictator Although the ad doesn’t name the dictator, it leaves no doubt of his identity. The screen flashes an Ivory Coast flag and a headline from the Daily Mail in England on April 12, 2011 saying "Defiant dictator arrested." That article detailed the overthrow and capture of Laurent Gbagbo, who had ruled the Ivory Coast since 2000 and is now awaiting trial before the International Criminal Court for crimes against humanity. The West African nation faced violent division during Gbagbo’s reign and for years, the ruler resisted international pressure to stand for reelection. Gillespie, meanwhile, co-founded his lobbying firm in 2000 with Democrat Jack Quinn, a former chief of staff to Vice President Al Gore. On Nov. 10, 2004, Quinn Gillespie and Associates signed a six-month contract, worth $510,000, with the Ivory Coast to improve the nation’s relations with the United States. Among other things, the firm agreed to organize a visit to Washington for Gbagbo and meetings with U.S. leaders. You won’t find Gillespie’s signature on the contract, however. That’s because he was absent from the firm for almost two years when the contract was signed, according to Paul Logan, Gillespie’s campaign spokesman. Logan said Gillespie went on leave in January 2003 to serve as chairman of the Republican National Committee and didn’t return until March 2005. The contract and the firm’s subsequent federal disclosure that it was representing a foreign agent was signed by Quinn. The firm’s work for Gbagbo started Dec. 22, 2004 and ended June 30, 2005, according to a disclosure statement it filed with the U.S. Department of Justice. Jeffrey Connaughton, then vice chairman of Quinn Gillespie, told The New Yorker in 2012 that firm was hoping to demonstrate that Gbagbo was willing to have free and fair elections. Those hopes soured, the article said, when Connaughton flew to the Ivory Coast, met with Gbagbo, and concluded the leader "had no interest in democracy -- he just wanted P.R." Connaughton sent us a statement, which he also gave to The Washington Post, saying Gillespie made it "clear" when the firm started that he would not represent foreign governments. "He was at the RNC when I decided to take the lead on Ivory Coast, so if anyone had checked with (the firm) or me, we would have confirmed that Ed had absolutely nothing to do with it." Gbagbo finally agreed to hold elections in November 2010, but lost to Alassane Ouattara, refused to give up power and ignited a civil war. Gbagbo was arrested in May when French and rebel forces took control of the capital, Abidjan. He has been sent to The Hague, where International Criminal Court has charged him with four counts of being an indirect co-perpetrator of violent acts committed his troops. Human Rights Watch estimates at least 3,000 people were killed and 150 women were raped during the six-month crisis. Other nations Warner’s ad also flashes the flags of four other countries it says Gillespie’s firm represented. David Turner, Warner’s campaign spokesman, backed the claim by sending us Quinn Gillespie disclosure forms. They showed the company worked for: Pakistan from April 2006 to April 2008 Costa Rica from a few weeks near the end of 2006 Macedonia from April 2007 to April 2008 Bosnian Serb Republic from January 2007 through December 2007 The firm reported earning a total of $3 million from all five nations. For perspective, Quinn Gillespie was paid $52.3 million by domestic clients from 2006 to 2008, according OpenSecrets.org. The payments from foreign nations came to 5.4 percent of the firm’s revenues during the three years. Gillespie says he’s never personally lobbied for a foreign government and the records back him up. Disclosure forms filed by the firm do not list him on its lobbying team for any of the nations. The teams generally had Democratic lobbyists, as indicated by their campaign donations, which were part of the disclosures. Gillespie left the firm in June 2007 to work in President George W. Bush’s administration. The company continued its relationship with Bosnia and Macedonia after his departure and signed new contracts with Japan and Indonesia. Our ruling Warner’s ad says Gillespie’s "firm lobbied for five foreign governments, including a dictator now awaiting trial for war crimes." The ad -- which is carefully worded -- has a point that Gillespie’s firm lobbied for five foreign governments, including the Ivory Coast, whose former ruler, Gbagbo, is awaiting trial at the International Criminal Court. But the ad’s effort to link Gillespie to a brutal dictator lacks important context. Gillespie had been on leave from the firm for more than a year when the Ivory Coast deal was signed. None of the company’s federal disclosures indicate Gillespie was involved in the representation of any foreign clients, and Gbagbo was charged with crimes against humanity for events that happened in 2010 and 2011, well after the firm’s relationship with the Ivory Coast ended. While there’s accuracy to Warner’s claim, it leaves out vital details. We rate it Half True.	None	Mark Warner	None	None	None	2014-10-24T12:03:23	2014-10-20	['None']
pomt-01668	Says his "Act 10 reforms" have "saved the taxpayers some $3 billion."	mostly true	/wisconsin/statements/2014/aug/20/scott-walker/scott-walker-says-union-reform-law-brought-massive/	Scott Walker’s signature accomplishment as governor, the Act 10 collective bargaining reform law, curtailed the powers of public employee unions, reduced the take-home pay of most public workers and caused months of protests in Madison. In a July 21, 2014 article in the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, Walker defended the three-year-old law, and made a claim that he’s already begun to repeat ahead of the November general election. "I support our Act 10 reforms," he said, "because they saved the taxpayers some $3 billion." Walker has long been touting how the state and local governments have used the "tools" in the law to reduce spending on pensions and health benefits for public employees. But Act 10 wasn’t a tax cut. So have taxpayers really saved some $3 billion? Billions and billions We’ve heard from Walker before about billions in savings. In March 2014, he claimed that once his Blueprint for Prosperity plan was signed into law, "we will have delivered $2 billion" in tax relief -- a claim we rated True. But that statement was about tax measures that have or will come about as a result of actions taken during Walker’s four-year term. The new claim refers to taxpayer savings as a result of Act 10. The law requires most state and local government employees to pay a larger share of the cost of their pension and health benefits -- which is where Walker’s claim of savings to taxpayers comes in. There was never a question that the financial impact would be large. In criticizing the law, the liberal Institute for Wisconsin’s Future said in December 2011 that the higher benefit contributions would cost public employees $700 million per year in take-home pay. And public employees, of course, are taxpayers, too. Pension contributions Pension savings make up the lion's share of Walker's claim. All state employees and nearly all local government employees participate in the state pension system. Only the City of Milwaukee and Milwaukee County run pension systems separate from the state. For years in the state system, state government and municipalities paid not only the employer share of pension contributions but -- primarily due to collective bargaining -- essentially all of the employee contributions. Act 10 requires that for most public employees, pension contributions be split equally between employees and employers. Contribution rates are adjusted each year, based on investment returns and other factors. For 2015, the rates are 6.8 percent of salary for most public employees and 7.7 percent for elected and executive employees. In other words, under Act 10, most public employees contribute 6.8 percent of their salaries for their pensions and their employers contribute the same amount. Walker puts the pension savings at $2.35 billion -- $1.56 billion from local government employees, plus $794.8 million from state employees (including those working for the University of Wisconsin System). That’s his tally for how much employees have contributed to their pensions from the time Act 10 took effect in 2011 through 2014, with the figure for 2014 being an estimate. We obtained figures from the state Department of Employee Trust Funds. They show $1.59 billion in state and local government employee pension contributions from 2011 through 2013. And, more than half way through 2014, the department expects the 2014 employee contributions to be at or slightly above the $761 million they were in 2013. So, even if the employee contributions in 2014 turn out to be the same as in 2013, the total savings to taxpayers would be $1.59 billion plus $761 million, or a total of $2.35 billion -- the same total Walker claims. But it bears repeating -- it isn’t as though those pension costs disappeared. Rather, they were transferred from taxpayers as a whole to public employees. Health insurance The next-largest Act 10 savings cited by Walker is from health insurance. It’s similar to pension savings in that public employees are picking up a greater share of the cost, easing the burden on general taxpayers. Act 10 requires most public employees to pay at least 12 percent of their premiums, which translated into a big increase for many employees and a savings for state and local governments. In addition, Act 10 gives public employers flexibility to change benefits, which can also result in additional savings for the unit of government involved. Walker says school districts statewide saved $200 million in health insurance costs just in 2011-’12, the first year after Act 10. That calculation comes from the nonpartisan Wisconsin Taxpayers Alliance. Dale Knapp, the group’s research director, told us the figure is conservative. Meanwhile, Walker says state government has saved $482 million on health insurance savings as a result of the higher employee premium contributions and changes made to health coverage -- $264 million for 2012 and 2013, plus $218 million for 2014 and 2015. He cited figures the State Budget Office uses to help create the state budget. The $200 million in school district health insurance savings plus the $482 million in state savings equals $682 million in health savings. Added to the $2.35 billion in pension savings makes $3.03 billion in total savings. The figures don’t take into account health insurance savings seen by municipalities, nor health savings seen by school districts after the first year of Act 10, so the actual number would be higher. Knapp said he’s not aware of any savings calculations for municipalities. Moreover, there is anecdotal evidence of other savings throughout the state. For example, a Milwaukee Public Schools actuarial report in 2012 said Act 10 enabled the school district to shave $1 billion from its long-term benefit obligations to retirees. MPS used the law to raise eligibility requirements for retirement benefits other than pension and changed the design of health care plans. Similarly, we found in a previous Act 10 factcheck that the law saved Milwaukee County $22 million in pension and health benefits in 2012, although that didn’t fully offset a reduction in state aid. That leads to an important point before we close. The Act 10 savings aren’t a dollar-for-dollar a tax cut for taxpayers. Rather, they are savings in the context of a budget and what would otherwise be spent for a particular purpose or program. Indeed, Walker himself has often said that easing the employee benefits burden on state and local governments has given them flexibility -- whether that’s using the savings for property tax relief, shifting money to other spending or offsetting cuts in state aid. Our rating Walker says his "Act 10 reforms" have "saved the taxpayers some $3 billion." Requiring most state and local government employees to contribute more to their pensions has saved public employers more than $3 billion, including $2.35 billion in pension costs, and there are more savings that haven’t fully been tallied. Those costs haven’t simply been eliminated, however. They’ve been taken on by public employees, who are also taxpayers. We rate the statement Mostly True.

pomt-12879	Imitation dairy products often differ nutritionally from those they mimic, and labeling them "milk" or "cheese" or "yogurt" is "against the law."	mostly true	/wisconsin/statements/2017/jan/27/tammy-baldwin/labeling-imitation-dairy-products-milk-or-cheese-o/	Hostilities between the dairy industry and its competitors are flaring anew as alternatives to cow’s milk take up more space in the dairy case. That means the politicians can’t be far behind. U.S. Sen. Tammy Baldwin, a Wisconsin Democrat, spoke up Jan. 12, 2017 in a news release lauding herself as somebody who "stands up for Wisconsin dairy farmers." Baldwin wants Congress to pass the Dairy PRIDE Act -- officially known (at least to a few) as the "Defending Against Imitations and Replacements of Yogurt, milk, and cheese to Promote Regular Intake of Dairy Everyday Act." After two years of falling milk prices, she and other federal lawmakers want the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to enforce consumer regulations defining "milk." Is Baldwin right that imitation dairy products -- for instance, soy milk -- often differ nutritionally from dairy item? And is labeling them "milk" or "cheese" or "yogurt" against the law? To back that up, Baldwin’s office pointed us to nutritional labels, and to FDA regulations that plainly state: "Milk is the lacteal secretion, practically free from colostrum, obtained by the complete milking of one or more healthy cows." 'Against the law' To dairy officials, inclusion of the word "milk" on non-dairy products is a misappropriation of the popularity of cow’s milk. But competitors say coconut milk and soy milk have long histories and aren’t confused with dairy. What’s more, they note, the FDA doesn’t punish "peanut butter" for using the dairy term "butter." But the FDA in 2008 and 2012 did tell two makers of drinks labeled "soy milk" that under its regulations, such labeling was inappropriate because the products did not contain "milk" as defined by the agency. "Soy drink" or "Soy beverage" would be better, the agency said at the time. That -- and regulatory language allowing the FDA to declare a product misbranded and try to block its sale -- help Baldwin’s case. Federal regulations are part of the United States Code that is the law of the land. But to the frustration of the dairy industry, the agency has not consistently enforced that line of reasoning, allowing use of "soy milk" and "almond milk" and many others. Rebecca Cross, a San Francisco-based regulatory lawyer for food product companies, said the FDA may be viewing labels on a case-by-case basis and allowing use of dairy terms on plant-based products so long as the use is not misleading. Nathan Beaver, a food and drug lawyer with Foley & Lardner in Washington, D.C., explained that foods such as soy milk that have no FDA-written "standard of identity" must choose a "common or usual" name for their products. Courts, though, have jurisdiction over disputes on the issue and therefore get final say on the meaning of the FDA rules. On milk, courts so far have found that cow’s milk competitors are not misbranded if their names don’t confuse consumers, said Cross. The nutrition comparison Dairy alternatives, Baldwin said, "contain a range of ingredients and nutrients that are often not equivalent to the nutrition content of dairy products." This is a bit tricky to evaluate given that beverages labeled as some kind of "milk" now come from such diverse sources as soy, almonds, cashews, hemp, rice, oats, coconut and sunflowers. For help, we turned to Vandana Sheth, a registered dietician and spokesperson for the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics, a leading organization of food and nutrition professionals. For starters, Sheth noted that dairy products can be a good source of calcium, vitamin D, protein and other essential nutrients. Soy milk provides close to the same amount of protein as cow’s milk. Rice milk typically provides minimal protein and is higher in carbohydrates. Almond milk is usually quite low in protein and also less calorically dense, she said. Plant protein tends to be of a lower quality than dairy proteins, though soy is close, said John Lucey, a food scientist who directs the Center for Dairy Research at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. Our own review of labels found that soy and almond beverages, like cow’s milk, are all relatively low calorie, low carbohydrate, low sodium drinks. They are all heavy with calcium. But they feature a different mix of vitamins and minerals, and fat content. Examples: soy milk has a lot of folate, while cow’s milk typically has none; cow’s milk contains some Vitamin C, but the soy, almond and hemp drinks we examined have none. Almond and soy milks feature some iron and fiber -- nutrients typically not found in cow’s milk. "All the products profile differently," said Susan Levin, a registered dietitian and director of nutrition education for the Washington, D.C.-based Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine. Bottom line: Baldwin’s nutrition observation is on target, based on a comparison of milk products. Our rating Baldwin claimed that imitation dairy products made from plants often differ nutritionally from the real thing, and labeling them "milk" or "cheese" or "yogurt" is "against the law." The nutrition point is accurate, and the legal point is partially so. Overall we rate her claim Mostly True.

"Bill Clinton cut the military drastically," Giuliani said. "It was called the peace dividend, one of those nice-sounding phrases: very devastating. It was a 25, 30 percent cut in the military." This claim is similar to others made by Mitt Romney in campaign speeches that we have previously checked and found were misleading. In April 2007, Romney said, "Following the end of the Cold War, President Clinton began to dismantle our military. He reduced our forces by 500,000. He retired almost 80 ships. Our spending on national defense dropped from over 6 percent of GDP to 3.8 percent today." The two Republicans are correct that military forces were reduced significantly under Clinton. The active-duty military totaled 1.8-million at the start of his presidency in 1993 and declined to 1.4-million in 2000. They are also correct that the naval fleet shrank dramatically. The Navy had 454 ships in 1993, but as vessels were retired and not replaced, the fleet was down to 341 by 2000. But they are selectively choosing numbers that make it appear that the military cuts were Clinton's alone. In fact, the cuts were prompted by the end of the Cold War during the presidency of President George H.W. Bush, a Republican. During Bush's presidency, he and Congress agreed to a sharp drop in military personnel. Active-duty military declined from 2.2-million to 1.8-million. Total defense forces also shrank, from 3.3-million to 2.9-million. The Republicans are trying to portray Clinton and the Democrats as weak on defense and to make the peace dividend look like a partisan effort. But contrary to the Republicans' claims, the post-Cold War shrinkage of the U.S. military was very much a bipartisan effort. It began under a Republican president and a Democratic Congress and continued under a Democratic president and a Republican Congress. And so we find, as we did before, that this claim is Half True.

pomt-00657	The 2005 round of military base closings "has not yet resulted in savings."	half-true	/virginia/statements/2015/may/15/rob-wittman/rob-wittman-says-2005-brac-round-base-closings-has/	U.S. Rep. Rob Wittman is trying to thwart the Pentagon’s efforts to begin a new round of military base closing. There have been five rounds of closures in recent decades, starting in the late 1980s as the Soviet Union collapsed and the U.S. military retooled for a post-Cold War mission. The last round took place in 2005 and talk of new spate is worrying congressmen who have bases in their districts. Wittman, a Republican, represents Virginia’s 1st District which includes the Army’s Fort A.P. Hill and the Marine base in Quantico. He recently questioned whether a new round of the Base Realignment and Closure program -- known as BRAC -- made strategic and economic sense. "We cannot forget that the 2005 BRAC round has not yet resulted in savings," he stated in an April 30 news release. We checked to see if he was right about the lacking of savings. Gordon Neal, Wittman’s spokesman, sent us a 2009 report from the nonpartisan Government Accountability Office that examined the bottom line of the 2005 BRAC, which shuttered 24 bases, realigned 24 others and eliminated about 12,000 civilian jobs. Calculations in the report were based on a Pentagon estimate that the 2005 BRAC would save Uncle Sam $3.9 billion a year -- an estimate that the GAO said is probably high. The GAO also noted that the military spent $35 billion implementing BRAC, far above the original $21 billion estimate. For example, it cost $1.7 billion more than expected to close Walter Reed Medical Center in Washington and move its operations to Fort Belvoir, Va. and the National Naval Medical Center in Bethesda, Md. A chart in the report shows the annual savings started in 2006, but those economies weren’t expected to be enough to pay off the upfront costs of BRAC until 2018, five years later than originally projected. The GAO updated its analysis in 2012 and found that the savings and cost estimates were still about the same. That’s the last time the agency did a cost analysis of the 2005 BRAC. "So 2018 should still be about the time that the savings would exceed the cost," Brian Lepore, GAO’s director of defense capabilities and management, wrote in an email. We spoke to two defense budget analysts and they both told us that Wittman’s statement is correct that the U.S. hasn’t yet pocketed "net savings" from the realignment. But that doesn’t mean the program isn’t paying off. Todd Harrison, a senior fellow at the Center for Strategic and Budgetary Assessments, said the last round of BRAC is producing savings but, for the moment, they’re going towards recovering the costs of implementing the program. "We are going to hit the break even point, and after that it’s all savings," Harrison told us. Harrison was among nearly 40 defense analysts who late last month signed a letter supporting the Pentagon’s call for another round of closings, saying there are surplus military installations around the nation. Harrison said Wittman’s use of the 2005 BRAC to argue against another round is off base. The last realignment round was different from the four that came in the 1980s and 1990s, Harrison said, because it focused much more heavily on base consolidations than previous rounds that were mostly directed at merely shuttering facilities. Consolidations are more expensive, he said, because they entail moving operations from one place to another, which means buildings have to be constructed. In 2012, Dorothy Robyn, then deputy under secretary of defense, made the same point in testimony before the House Armed Services Committee. "In short, the 2005 round took place during a period of growth in the military, and it reflected the goals and needs of that time. Because the focus was on transforming installations to better support forces -- as opposed to saving money and space -- it is a poor gauge of the savings that the Department can achieve through another BRAC round," she stated in written testimony. Robyn said the previous BRAC rounds in 1988, 1991, 1993 and 1995 totaled $8 billion in annual savings. Our ruling Wittman said that the 2005 BRAC round has "not resulted in savings." Savings are coming in every year, but they haven’t yet reached the break-even point of paying back the costs of BRAC. That’s expected to happen in 2018 and, after that, the money can be used for other purposes. Wittman’s statement is missing important information and creates a faulty impression that the 2005 BRAC has been a loser. On the whole, we rate his claim Half True.

pomt-05911	Says Pennsylvania charges a top income tax rate of 3 percent and Delaware "has no state income tax at all."	half-true	/new-jersey/statements/2012/feb/02/joe-pennacchio/republican-senator-claims-pennsylvania-charges-top/	As Democrats and Republicans squared off Monday on Gov. Chris Christie’s proposal to reduce state income taxes, state Sen. Joe Pennacchio reminded his fellow legislators of how taxpayers in Pennsylvania and Delaware are already getting better deals. Pennsylvania charges a top income tax rate of 3 percent, while Delaware doesn’t collect any state income taxes, according to Pennacchio. "We’re competing worldwide, but especially we’re competing with our regional states. This has to make us more competitive, because when you take a look at us versus Pennsylvania, it's still three percent in Pennsylvania," Pennacchio (R-Morris) said during a Senate Budget and Appropriations Committee hearing. "When you take a look at us versus Delaware, it's still zero in Delaware." In a news release issued following the meeting, Pennacchio repeated the claim: "A small decrease is a good first step to making New Jersey more competitive with states like Pennsylvania which charges a top rate of 3%, or Delaware which has no state income tax at all." Each time, Pennacchio was right about Pennsylvania, but wrong about Delaware. As PolitiFact New Jersey found, both states charge state income taxes. Pennacchio acknowledged in a phone interview that he was wrong about Delaware, but argued that New Jersey still needs to be competitive with its neighboring states. "I think the premise is still the same," Pennacchio told us. Here’s the story with state income taxes in Pennsylvania and Delaware: Pennsylvania charges a flat income tax rate of 3.07 percent on all taxpayers, regardless of income level. Certain individuals or families may qualify for a state program that eliminates or reduces their state income taxes. So, Pennacchio is correct about the 3 percent rate in the Keystone State. But Delaware also charges a state income tax. In 2011, that state’s rates ranged from 2.2 percent on taxable income greater than $2,000 to a top rate of 6.95 percent on taxable income greater than $60,000. This year, Delaware’s top rate is decreasing to 6.75 percent. (For shoppers looking to save some money, Delaware doesn’t have a sales tax.) These seven states don’t collect any state income taxes: Alaska, Florida, South Dakota, Washington, Nevada, Texas and Wyoming. New Hampshire and Tennessee impose taxes on interest and dividends income, but not one’s wages. It’s worth noting that the top income tax rates in Pennsylvania and Delaware still remain below the maximum rate in New Jersey, where individuals with taxable income exceeding $500,000 face a rate of 8.97 percent. Our ruling At a Senate committee hearing and then in a news release afterwards, Pennacchio claimed that Pennsylvania imposes an income tax rate of 3 percent and Delaware doesn’t collect any state income taxes. The senator’s on target when it comes to Pennsylvania, where taxpayers face a flat rate of 3.07 percent. But he’s wrong about Delaware, since that state imposes income tax rates ranging from 2.2 percent to more than 6 percent. We rate the statement Half True. To comment on this ruling, go to NJ.com.

pomt-00587	"We’re the only nation in the world that does not use the military to secure our border."	pants on fire!	/texas/statements/2015/jun/05/gary-painter/west-texas-sheriff-says-us-only-nation-not-use-mil/	A Texas sheriff was emphatic about the United States being alone on the planet in relying on non-military agencies to patrol its borders. Midland County Sheriff Gary Painter also was incorrect, we found. A Midland Reporter-Telegram news story posted online May 10, 2015 — in the wake of the Islamic State group claiming credit for a failed attack on a Garland, Texas, contest to draw cartoons of the Muslim Prophet Muhammad — quoted Painter saying he had no doubt ISIS has "contacts in Mexico supporting them. They’re a huge threat," Painter said, "because it is an avenue of approach to get into the U.S." Our eyes clamped on what Painter said next: "We’re the only nation in the world that does not use the military to secure our border. We’re not serious about it." By phone, Painter told us the United States is one of the few nations in the world not using the military to secure the border. He said he based his declaration on news reports showing military forces on the borders of other countries. "All you’ve got to do is look at the news on TV," Painter said. "You see it." He said he didn’t remember which countries he saw on those news reports. Experts say not so In contrast, experts we consulted called the Texan’s statement a substantial exaggeration. That said, some countries have heavy military presences on national borders, such as the forces watching over the demilitarized zone dividing North and South Korea. Separately, Israel’s 7,500-member Border Police, a branch of the Israel National Police, deals with problems relating to public security, terror, severe crime, rioting, guarding sensitive sites and securing rural areas, according to Israel’s Ministry of Public Security. In Mexico, a mix of agencies rely on the Army and Navy and the federal police to watch over its borders, Christopher Wilson of the Mexico Institute at the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars told us by phone. But, Wilson said, Mexico’s ports of entry are run by the country’s customs service with immigration-related security managed by its Instituto de Migracion. The military branches provide security at the ports as needed, Wilson said, and also are in charge of stopping and catching traffickers in drugs and people. Wilson said numerous countries similarly rely on military forces to pitch in near international borders in part because some border zones are isolated and other agencies don’t have the manpower. He offered as examples of strong military presences Guatemala and Brazil. Then again, Ross Burkhart, a Boise State University professor, told us by email, countries don’t deploy troops on borders unless they’re engaged in cross-border conflicts "that necessitate emergency border management procedures. Weak states in sub-Saharan Africa have most recently fallen into this category," Burkhart said. Lance Janda, a military historian at Cameron University in Lawton, Okla., said by phone that Canada and Costa Rica, which has border guards but no regular military, are examples of the many countries that do not secure their respective borders with the military. Then again, many countries have border-area checkpoints run by officers with weapons, he said. Commenting on the sheriff’s mention of TV news reports, Janda said: "Anything on the news is going to be violence, right? They’re not going to say nothing happened today on the border between Vietnam and Laos." U.S. Homeland Security For our part, we checked on how the United States regulates border security, then peeked at how Canada does so. In both instances, the military has not been the primary agency handling border safety. By email, Wilson said civilian law enforcement agencies handle U.S. border security. Still, he said, "we have securitized border management, rolling customs and immigration functions into agencies that have law enforcement and national security at the heart of their mission." On its website, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security says it "secures the nation's air, land, and sea borders to prevent illegal activity while facilitating lawful travel and trade." Homeland Security’s border security overview says U.S. Customs officials and a record 21,000-plus Border Patrol "agents, agriculture specialists, Air and Marine agents, and officers guard America’s front lines. These men and women prevent terrorists and their weapons from entering the United States while continuing their mission of seizing contraband and apprehending criminals and others who illegally attempt to enter the United States." Other Homeland Security agencies relevant to border security include the United States Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), responsible for criminal and civil enforcement of federal laws governing border control, customs, trade and immigration and the Transportation Security Administration. So, the U.S. military doesn’t lead the charge on border security, which is in keeping with the Posse Comitatus Act, passed into law in 1878, which barred the Army from being employed to execute laws unless otherwise authorized by Congress or the Constitution. Still, Homeland Security has a military component: the United States Coast Guard is entrusted with defending the country’s maritime borders. And it’s not as if military forces don’t get called in. The non-partisan Congressional Research Service said in a February 2013 report, "Although the military does not have primary responsibility to secure the borders, the Armed Forces generally provide support to law enforcement and immigration authorities along the southern border." Since the 1980s, the report said, U.S. forces including the National Guard, as authorized by Congress, have conducted a wide variety of counterdrug support missions along the borders of the United States." The Defense Department’s "support role in counterdrug and counterterrorism efforts appears to have increased the department’s profile in border security," the report said. Also, Presidents George W. Bush and Barack Obama each authorized National Guard troops to help watch the border with Mexico, the report said. Canada We didn’t have to venture far to find another country that doesn’t police its borders with the military. Canada’s Border Services Agency says it "ensures the security and prosperity of Canada by managing the access of people and goods to and from Canada." Broadly, the agency says it’s "responsible for providing integrated border services that support national security and public safety priorities." We spotted no mention of Canada’s armed forces being involved in border security. They’re not, academic experts told us. Burkhart, who helps direct Boise State’s Canadian Studies program, said by email the Canada Border Services Agency handles such duties with support from the Royal Canadian Mounted Police in concert with the U.S. Coast Guard under the joint law enforcement "Shiprider" maritime security program in the Great Lakes and the Pacific Northwest. "The Canadian Forces, the name for the Canadian military, does not participate in border enforcement," Burkhart said. Other nations To our inquiry about countries using the military to secure borders, Peter Andreas, a Brown University professor, singled out Germany as a country whose military doesn’t secure the border. "Of course," Andreas said by email, "all nations that have a military would use the military if there were a military attack from another country." In the same vein, Edward Alden, a senior fellow at the Washington, D.C.-based Council on Foreign Relations, called the sheriff’s claim ridiculous. "Almost all advanced countries use law enforcement officials who are much like our own Border Patrol and Coast Guard," Alden emailed. By email, Denmark-based author Frank Jacobs advised that most European Union countries don't use the military to secure their borders. He said the Schengen Area describes the EU states and even a few non-EU nations where business people and tourists can freely circulate without being subjected to border checks. Anyone crossing into the United Kingdom faces border checks, he said, though those are handled by Her Majesty's Border Force, which is not a military force, but an agency of the Home Office (Ministry of the Interior). He said that travelers returning to the Schengen Area have to pass through the French douane, but that is not a military unit, instead a part of the Ministry for the Budget, Public Accounts and the Civil Service. Janda followed up by email, calling the sheriff’s statement "demonstrably false. Most countries in the world use national law enforcement to police their borders just like we do." He added: "The only countries that rely on their military to police/defend their borders are nations facing severe instability involving lawlessness and/or refugees in neighboring countries and/or open warfare." Our ruling Painter said the U.S. stands alone in the world in not using the military to secure "our border." We didn’t have to go far to prove Painter wrong. Canada is one of many countries that rely on federal patrols, not the military, to handle border oversight, just as the United States does. The sheriff might’ve seen some border-guarder troops in war-torn lands in TV news reports, but that’s not factual basis for this claim. Pants on Fire!

pomt-06286	A Republican-led softening of firearms training rules means that "untrained individuals" would be allowed to carry guns with a state permit.	true	/wisconsin/statements/2011/nov/21/donna-seidel/seidel-says-untrained-people-would-be-allowed-carr/	The latest turn in Wisconsin’s long path to becoming the 49th state to allow carrying concealed weapons featured a Republican attorney general watching helplessly as Republican lawmakers tossed out several specific firearms training rules he drew up. When the smoke cleared, Democrats protested that GOP lawmakers went too far by eliminating a set amount of safety training (four hours) and instructor-signed proof of graduation from a firearms course before a permit could be issued. "Suspending these requirements is an abuse of power that will endanger the lives of Wisconsinites across our state," said state Rep. Donna Seidel, D-Wausau, the Assembly’s assistant minority leader. Her Nov. 7, 2011, statement continued: "This would allow untrained individuals to carry guns into public spaces where children are present, but rather than protect Wisconsin’s children, Republicans chose to pay off their friends in the gun lobby with another gift." We knew Attorney General J.B. Van Hollen argued the changes could make it tougher to prove fraud by firearms course instructors and students. But would people without any training at all be able to get a state permit? We asked Seidel to back up her claim, and her office pointed to Van Hollen’s testimony at the hearing before a legislative rules committee. In Madison, legislators write laws, which prompt agencies to pen specific rules to carry out the Legislature’s intent. A joint legislative committee reviews the rules and has the power to alter them. Let’s start with Van Hollen’s written testimony and his oral remarks on the rules and the changes, as well as documents on the Department of Justice website. He spoke shortly before the panel: Removed any time requirement for the firearms safety and training course. (Van Hollen had put in a four-hour minimum.) Took out the word ‘test’ from Van Hollen’s description of the required firearms safety and training course. Removed Van Hollen’s rule that people who teach the course get at least eight hours of instructor training. Took out Van Hollen’s rule that permit applicants get their instructor’s signature affirming the course was completed. It did the same for instructor contact information, and the location where the training was provided. Van Hollen said the rewrite of his rules, sought by the National Rifle Association, would make Wisconsin’s law among the most lenient among states that require permits. PolitiFact Wisconsin found the same thing in our reporting on an earlier item on the training requirements. States typically do one or more of the following: certify the training organization, their instructors or their courses; mandate specific topics for training; set a minimum number of hours; require the instructor to sign the training certificate. Wisconsin now requires none of those. The requirement to get an instructor-led safety course and provide a graduation certificate is still in effect, but Van Hollen told lawmakers the changes would "effectively gut" the training requirement because proving fraud would be next to impossible. The law, with the rules changes, is too vague to determine whether applications meet any meaningful standard, he said. "We can create as many laws as we want, but if we don’t have the ability to prove and prosecute them, they’re meaningless," Van Hollen said. "In a very real sense," Van Hollen wrote in written testimony, "an individual who has been certified by a ‘national or state organization’ could stand on the street corner and after a short conversation on firearm safety could hand out certificates for a fee." The state would risk legal challenges if it denied applications because only vague and subjective training criteria are left, he said. So what was the bottom line? Did Van Hollen say untrained individuals could slip through? He told the committee: "In essence, we will accept every application at face value without determining whether substantive and meaningful training has occurred." He concluded: "If the four-hour training requirement is removed from the statute and rules as they exist today, that effectively eliminates our ability to screen applicants … to determine whether anybody actually really met a training requirement or not." Van Hollen said his office would be forced to be "very liberal" in approving permits. Legal experts concurred that Van Hollen would be in a difficult spot if he tried to reject applications based on questions about meeting the ill-defined training requirement. Former Wisconsin Attorney General Peg Lautenschlager said Van Hollen is probably correct that if he denies applications based on questionable training that the state would get sued. And could well lose, she added. "I think he was left without anything to enforce," Lautenschlager said. Speaking generally about the appropriate role of an attorney general dealing with lawmakers, Jim Tierney, a former Maine attorney general, said: "This is an attorney general doing his job. You have to keep the elephants inside the ring. You have the constitution and due process and procedures that have to be followed. It’s an essential part of democracy." Finally, we spoke to Jim Franklin, executive director of the Minnesota Sheriffs Association. In that state, county sheriffs investigate and issue permits for concealed carry. The state law, in contrast to Wisconsin’s, requires safety instructors to submit their courses to the state for certification. The average course is 4 to 6 hours. The instructors have to sign off. The course curriculum is laid out by the state. We asked Franklin whether he could evaluate applicants’ training without those requirements in the law. "It would be much more difficult," he said. "It would be not impossible but certainly more difficult. We negotiated these things to avoid many of those pitfalls and strengthen the confidence of the public that good checking is going on." Our conclusion Seidel said a Republican-led weakening of firearms training rules means that "untrained individuals" would be allowed to carry guns with a state permit. As support, she cited comments by Van Hollen. We found his comments, at the very least, strongly suggest that people faking the training could still get permits. Others back up Van Hollen’s assertion that he would be in a weak position, and it’s clear Wisconsin’s rules would be among the most lenient among states requiring permits. The law is still on the books requiring an instructor-led training course, but it’s hard to prove that someone skipped it. So the door is open to "untrained" individuals getting a permit. We rate Seidel’s statement True.	None	Donna Seidel	None	None	None	2011-11-21T09:00:00	2011-11-07	['None']

With jobs and the economy a key focus in the tight race between Walker and Democratic challenger Mary Burke, the governor touted a report that said the state had added an estimated 8,400 jobs in September. A day after the numbers came out, and hours before his second debate with Burke, Waker told the League of Wisconsin Municipalities in an Oct. 17, 2014 speech: "Yesterday at noon, the Wisconsin Department of Workforce Development announced that our labor numbers, the numbers of jobs created in the private sector last month, for September, was 8,400 -- 8,400 new private-sector jobs were created in the state of Wisconsin last month." He continued with a claim we want to check: "That's the largest private-sector job creation we've had in the month of September in more than a decade. In more than a decade." In the days since, Walker has repeated the claim many times. Is he right? Tallying jobs The September jobs report is a preliminary one. It is extrapolated from a monthly survey of 3.5 percent of state employers by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. As such, the monthly numbers have a large margin of error and can swing widely when they are made final. This batch, for instance, has a margin of error of 7,980. The numbers can even change again later, when much more accurate quarterly numbers -- based on a census of nearly every state employer -- can be used to adjust monthly numbers. Nevertheless, the numbers are the most recent ones available. When we asked Walker’s campaign for backup, spokeswoman Alleigh Marre simply made the point they are the most recent month numbers and noted the numbers are widely reported each month. When we looked at a decade of Bureau of Labor Statistics data, September 2014 did come out on top: 2005: 2,000 2006: 1,200 2007: -3,700 2008: -8,700 2009: 400 2010: -3,200 2011: 4,400 2012: 6,400 2013: 1,300 2014: 8,400 The next-largest job gain for that time frame was an addition of 6,400 jobs in September 2012. The pendulum swung the other way in 2008, during the worst stretch of the economic downturn, when there were 8,700 jobs lost in that single month. To be sure, the September 2014 numbers are preliminary and the ones for previous years are final. So, there is a bit of apples-oranges going on in the comparison. But when when we rated Mostly True a Walker claim on how Wisconsin compares to Midwestern states for job growth over the past year, a federal BLS official told us it was reasonable to compare the preliminary number with a prior year, with the understanding the new number is not final. In that claim, Walker had compared preliminary July numbers from 2014 with final July numbers from 2013. That comparison showed the state ranked third in the Midwest. Of course, we can’t predict what the revised September jobs figure will be when the next round of data comes out in November 2014. But if it’s revised down by 2,000 or more jobs, then this would not be the best September in 10 years. Again, that best-in-Midwest growth claim is instructive. When the final numbers came out, the ranking fell from third to fourth. (And Walker revised his talking point.) In any case, we can only rate a claim based on what is known at the time it is made. And this one holds up, even by another measure. We also dug out the preliminary September reports for past years, so we could see how preliminary numbers for September 2014 compare to preliminary numbers for previous Septembers (We’re kinda geeky that way). The records for 2013 were complicated because of the federal government shut down and the comparable data for before 2009 wasn’t available. But the preliminary tally of 8,400 jobs in 2014 topped 2012 ( increase of 1,500), 2011 (decrease of 900) and 2010 (decrease of 9,900). Past use of the numbers Close readers will note that Walker has had a decidedly love-hate-love relationship with the monthly numbers, at times embracing them and at times dismissing them. In December 2011, Workforce Development Secretary Reggie Newson described the numbers this way: "These unreliable employment statistics out of Washington misinform the public and create unnecessary anxiety for job seekers and job creators about the shape of our state’s economy." Instead, state officials -- including Walker -- began to stress the more accurate quarterly numbers. Until the campaign season, when monthly numbers were back in vogue. We have even put Walker’s views on the numbers on the Flip-O-Meter, and rated them a Full Flop. But here we are simply rating what Walker said; the Truth-O-Meter does not have a hypocrisy setting. Our rating Walker claims that the September report which showed an increase of 8,400 jobs was the best in the past 10 years for that month. That stacks up. And a BLS official says the approach is legitimate, with the caveat the latest year is preliminary. Thus, we rate the claim Mostly True.

pomt-10812	"Today New Mexico (has) the sixth-fastest growing economy."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2007/sep/27/bill-richardson/not-exactly-but-close/	At the Democratic debate at Dartmouth College on Sept. 26, 2007, New Mexico Gov. Bill Richardson boasted about his state's economic growth. "New Mexico (has) the sixth-fastest growing economy," he said. He did not elaborate, so it's unclear whether he was referring to job growth or the state's gross domestic product. In his speeches and TV ads, Richardson has often mentioned job growth as an indicator of a strong economy while he's been governor. In his TV ads, he's boasted that for job growth, the state ranked as high as sixth in the nation. However, the latest employment report from the New Mexico Department of Workforce Solutions, which tracks job data, said the state ranked 14th for job growth in August 2007. The state hasn't ranked sixth since August 2006. If economic strength is measured by the increase in state's gross domestic product, New Mexico actually ranks higher than sixth. Measured by the change from 2005 to 2006 (the most recent data available), the state ranks fifth, according to U.S. Commerce Department data. So if Richardson was using this measurement of the economy, he slightly understated his state's growth. Either way, Richardson is generally correct that the state's economy has done well in his term (largely because of gains in the oil and gas industry). We find his claim Mostly True.

pomt-04905	Tim Kaine, as governor, proposed tax increases on people earning "as little as $17,000."	true	/virginia/statements/2012/aug/03/george-allen/george-allen-says-tim-kaine-tried-raise-taxes-peop/	Republican Senate candidate George Allen recently accused Democratic opponent Tim Kaine of being a tax hiker, even on people of modest means. During a July 21 debate in Hot Springs, Allen criticized Kaine for "actually proposing tax increases that would be hitting people earning as little as $17,000 a year." We checked to see if Kaine, who was governor from 2006 to 2010, really did try to raise taxes on people at that income level. The Allen campaign, in a website post, backed Allen’s statement by citing news articles about a proposal Kaine unveiled in December 2009 as part of his farewell biennial budget proposal for 2010-2012. Kaine called for adding a 1 percent income tax surcharge and giving all proceeds to localities in return for them scrapping the car tax they levy on personal vehicles. Legislators in 1998 adopted a five-year plan to phase out the personal property tax on most cars and reimburse localities for their lost revenues. But the program was more expensive than anticipated and legislators eventually capped the state reimbursement at $950 million a year. The remaining share is paid by vehicle owners. Ending the car tax would mean the state wouldn’t have to provide the annual $950 million payment to localities, Kaine said in a speech to the General Assembly’s money committees. Kaine wanted to use the savings to help balance the state’s recession-wracked budget. News articles from the time said Kaine’s policy would raise the maximum state income tax rate from 5.75 percent to 6.75 percent. That maximum rate applies to all taxable income above $17,000 after deductions and exemptions are taken into account. The state charges gradually higher income tax rates up to that level. Virginia puts a 2 percent levy on the first $3,000 of taxable income, 3 percent of the next $2,000, 5 percent on the next $12,000 and then 5.75 percent on all taxable income above $17,000. The bill advancing Kaine’s proposal did not say the added tax would only be levied on taxable income of $17,000 or more. The added 1 percent surtax would have pertained to all income levels, according to Joel Davison, a spokesman for the Virginia Department of Finance. Virginia does not require individuals with a state adjusted income below $11,950 and married couples with a state adjusted income below $23,900 to pay state income taxes. So they wouldn’t have been affected by the tax increase. Kaine’s proposal was killed by the General Assembly. It should be noted that some people earning $17,000 would have benefitted from Kaine’s plan if their savings from the elimination of the car tax outstripped their increased income tax. There are no estimates of the number of Virginians who would fallen into this category, but we suspect it would be a small group. Here’s why: For starters, we can eliminate those who didn’t own cars. Now, let’s consider those who did own vehicles. A single filer with no children earning $17,000 would have a taxable income of $13,070 after taking the standard deduction and exemption. A 1 percent income tax increase for that person would come to almost $131 a year. The car levy paid by that person would depend on where he or she lived because each locality sets it own tax rate based on the assessed value of the vehicle. In Richmond, a person wouldn’t pay a $131 levy unless they had a car worth about $9,000. In rural Henry County, a vehicle would have to be valued at about $17,500 to merit a $131 tax. Our ruling Allen said that Kaine proposed a tax increase that would have affected people earning "as little as $17,000 a year." Not everyone at that level would have paid more under Kaine’s plan, but it’s a safe bet that large number of them would have seen their overall tax bill rise. We rate Allen’s statement True.

The winner of their Aug. 14, 2018 primary will face Democratic U.S. Sen. Tammy Baldwin. Like us on Facebook. Follow us on Twitter: @PolitiFactWisc. In a July 31, 2018 interview on the national Fox Business Network, host Stuart Varney had this exchange with Vukmir about Trump: Varney: Do you back him 100 percent? Vukmir: I have always been there with him, I’ve stood with him, I continue to stand with him. Always? No. Chronology Before the Wisconsin primary in April 2016, Vukmir first supported Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker, who briefly ran for the GOP nomination before dropping out in September 2015. Then she backed U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida, who ended his run in March 2016. Vukmir said she ultimately voted for Cruz in the Wisconsin primary. So, Vukmir wasn’t with Trump then. (For his part, Nicholson wasn’t an original Trump supporter, either. He supported Rubio initially, but said he voted for Trump in the primary.) It wasn’t until the general election campaign that Vukmir endorsed Trump, was part of a women for Trump group and appeared in a radio ad supporting his candidacy against the Democratic nominee, Hillary Clinton. Vukmir’s campaign didn’t respond to our requests to provide information on this fact check. (Note: We’ve rated as False a claim by Nicholson that Vukmir said: "I’m not endorsing Donald Trump.") All of our fact checks in the Wisconsin U.S. Senate race. Our rating Vukmir said: "I have always been there with" Trump. Vukmir prominently supported Trump for president in 2016 after he won the Republican nomination. But before that, she supported other GOP contenders for the nomination and was sharply critical of Trump. We rate Vukmir’s statement False.

pomt-05953	Says Newt Gingrich said "Spanish is the language of the ghetto."	mostly true	/florida/statements/2012/jan/25/mitt-romney/spanish-language-ad-says-newt-gingrich-said-spanis/	Mitt Romney and Newt Gingrich are attacking each other on all fronts in Florida ahead of the Jan. 31, 2012, primary -- including en Español. In one Spanish-language radio ad, Gingrich calls Romney "anti-immigrant." (The Gingrich campaign said it was pulling the ad on Jan. 25, 2012, after Sen. Marco Rubio said it was unfair and not true.) In a rebuttal, Romney attacks Gingrich on radio as not being the Ronald Reagan conservative Gingrich claims. Romney also says that Gingrich said "Spanish is the language of the ghetto." Here’s a partial transcript of the ad, which is airing in South Florida (translation courtesy of Patricia Mazzei of the Miami Herald): "Gingrich enriched himself with Freddie Mac, one of the principle companies responsible for the mortgage collapse that has caused so much damage in our community. Reagan would have never joined forces with Nancy Pelosi as Gingrich did for advancing the extreme left agenda. And Reagan would have never offended Hispanics as Gingrich did when he said Spanish is the language of the ghetto. Now, searching for votes, Gingrich wants to change history. But the facts speak for themselves. Paid for by Romney for President, Incorporated." We’ve written about Gingrich’s relationship with Freddie Mac and Nancy Pelosi in other items. Here, we’re focusing on the claim that Gingrich said, "Spanish is the language of the ghetto." The claim comes from a speech Gingrich gave on March 31, 2007, to the National Federation of Republican Women, as he was considering running for president in 2008. We tracked down the speech in its entirety through C-SPAN, which originally broadcast the speech and has a wonderful video archive. You can watch Gingrich’s remarks by clicking here; the statements germane to this fact-check begin about 23 minutes in. "Nobody in the elite world understands this, this is an enormous center-right country," Gingrich said. "This was driven home for me a couple weeks ago when I was doing a press release for English First. They gave me some data. Eighty-five percent of the American people believe English should be the official language of government." After breaking for applause, Gingrich continued, "Now that's according to a Rasmussen poll. Zogby came back and said that's too high -- the number's 84. Gingrich then pivoted to the founding of the colony of Jamestown, "when people who believed their rights came from God first stepped foot on this continent." They had a "very simple model," he said: "We should replace bilingual education with immersion in English so people learn the common language of the country and so they learn the language of prosperity, not the language of living in a ghetto," Gingrich said. "Second … we should establish that citizenship requires passing a test on American history in English. And if that's true, we do not have to print ballots in any language except English." Gingrich’s comments were picked up that day by the Associated Press, which said Gingrich equated bilingual education with "the language of living in a ghetto." In looking at his remarks, he did not directly make that linkage -- his "language of living in a ghetto" is juxtaposed with "the language of prosperity." But the larger context, particularly the remark about ballot language, suggests that he was referring to Spanish. He was widely criticized for the comment. The AP article quoted Peter Zamora, co-chair of the Washington-based Hispanic Education Coalition, which supports bilingual education, as saying, "The tone of his comments were very hateful. Spanish is spoken by many individuals who do not live in the ghetto." On April 4, Gingrich posted a video on YouTube to explain the comments. He looked in the camera and spoke -- in Spanish. "Last weekend I made some comments that I recognize produced a bad feeling within the Latino community," Gingrich said in Spanish (his comments in the video are subtitled into English). "The words I chose to express myself were not the best, and what I wanted to say is this. In the United States it is important to speak English well in order to progress and have success. To achieve this goal, we should replace bilingual education programs with intensive English instruction courses and in this way permit that English be the language that all of us have in common. "This is an expression of support for Latinos, not an attack on their language. I have never believed that Spanish is a language of people of low income nor a language without beauty." Gingrich did not explicitly apologize for his comments in the web video. Gingrich was asked about the "ghetto" comment on Jan. 25, 2012, during an interview with Univision. He sidestepped the question in his answer. "I said -- about all languages -- I am for English as the common, unifying language," he said. "If I were going to live in Mexico, I would say that Spanish is really important for me to learn." Our ruling A Romney radio ad playing in Spanish in South Florida claims that Gingrich said "Spanish is the language of the ghetto." In a speech in 2007, Gingrich said that some language other than English is the "language of living in a ghetto." Gingrich didn’t say specifically that he was talking about Spanish, though most people assumed that was the language he was referencing. Gingrich recorded a web video in Spanish a few days later saying he could have worded his comments better. With those caveats in mind, we rate this claim Mostly True.

pomt-02363	Russian annexation of Crimea "removes a million residents of the Ukraine that have provided the margin of victory for (Viktor) Yanukovych, the pro-Moscow prime minister in his last election."	mostly true	/punditfact/statements/2014/mar/19/karl-rove/karl-rove-says-crimea-annexation-removes-viktor-ya/	We and our friends at PolitiFact are used to poring over American election results. Here, we’ll test our skills looking at election returns from Ukraine. We’re checking a claim by Karl Rove, a former top adviser to President George W. Bush, who appeared on the March 16, 2014, edition of Fox News Sunday. Rove was discussing the Russian takeover of Crimea, suggesting that Russian-leaning candidates would now face long odds in Ukrainian politics without the votes of supporters on the Crimean peninsula. First, some background. Crimea which had long been a part of Russia until it was handed over in 1954 by Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev. After the breakup of the Soviet Union in the early 1990s, Crimea, despite the presence of Russian military facilities and a majority-Russian populace, remained part of the newly independent Ukraine. But earlier this month, protesters in the Ukrainian capital of Kiev ousted pro-Russia president Viktor Yanukovych. After a pro-western transitional government took power, Russia sent troops into Crimea -- located on the country’s southeast flank -- and scheduled a referendum to determine whether Crimea should affiliate with Russia. In the March 16 referendum, which was criticized by the West as illegal, roughly 97 percent of Crimean voters sided with secession to Russia. Within two days, Russian president Vladimir Putin had formally accepted Crimea into Russia by signing an annexation treaty. While this treaty still needs to pass through a few more hoops to take effect, these are considered formalities. On Fox News Sunday, Rove operated under the assumption that annexation would go forward. Annexation, Rove said, "removes a million residents of the Ukraine that have provided the margin of victory for Yanukovych, the pro-Moscow prime minister in his last election." Such a change to the map would mean that the remainder of Ukraine, following the removal of one of its strongest pro-Russia bastions, would become more favorable electoral territory for pro-Ukrainian politicians. In the United States, it might be analogous to gains the Democratic Party could make if Texas were to secede from the union, or gains the GOP could make if California were to quit the United States. We wondered whether what Rove said was accurate, so we looked through Ukrainian election results from the 2010 presidential election. In that election, the second and final round of voting pitted Yanukovych against pro-Ukraine politician Yulia Tymoshenko. In the final balloting, Yanukovych defeated Tymoshenko 49 percent to 46 percent. In order for Rove to be correct, Yanukovych’s margin of victory over Tymoshenko in Crimea and Sevastopol -- the two regions that joined Russia -- would have to match or exceed his margin of victory in the nation as a whole. It turns out that Rove’s claim was close, but not perfect. In Crimea, Yanukovych beat Tymoshenko by a 639,529-vote margin, and in Sevastopol, he won by a 156,261-vote margin. Together, that equals a margin of 795,790. Nationally, though, Yanukovych beat Tymoshenko by a somewhat larger margin -- 887,909 votes. So Yanukovych’s margin in Crimea and Sevastopol didn’t account for all of his national margin of victory, but it came close -- about 90 percent of the vote. Dominique Arel, who chairs the Ukrainian studies department at the University of Ottawa, said that "47 percent of the electorate lives in the southeast. With the removal of Crimea, it probably shrinks to 45 percent or a touch less, making it very difficult in a polarized election for a southeast candidate to win." A final note: Other regions provided even more votes for Yanukovych than Crimea and Sevastopol did. Donetsk provided him with a margin of more than 2.2 million votes, while Luhansk gave him a margin of more than 1.1 million votes. Our ruling Rove said that Russian annexation of Crimea "removes a million residents of the Ukraine that have provided the margin of victory for (Viktor) Yanukovych, the pro-Moscow prime minister in his last election." Crimea and neighboring Sevastopol -- the two newly annexed portions of Russia -- were certainly bastions of support for Yanukovych in the 2010 election. But while they came close to providing his entire national margin of victory, they fell a bit short, providing 90 percent of Yanukovych’s winning margin. We rate Rove’s claim Mostly True.

pomt-00666	The state budget will include scholarship money for minority students as a concession to Senate Democrats for supporting the GOP-initiated transportation bill.	true	/georgia/statements/2015/may/13/senate-democrats/Democrats-parlay-votes-on-transportation-bill-into/	On May 4th, Gov. Nathan Deal signed into law the year’s most talked about bill -- one allowing the state to raise about $1 billion a year to tackle a backlog of transportation needs. The state’s Republican leadership initially wanted transportation issues handled closer to home. But a majority of the state’s voters nixed that idea in 2012, when a special purpose local option sales tax for transportation, the so-called T-SPLOST, was defeated in nine of 12 regions, including metro Atlanta. Passing the transportation bill, House Bill 170, this year -- even with Lt. Gov. Casey Cagle, House Speaker David Ralston and behind it -- wasn’t easy, either. Some Democratic votes proved essential. Senate Democrats parlayed their support for the bill into concessions from Deal’s office related to one of their long-standing concerns, underrepresentation of minorities in contract awards at the Georgia Department of Transportation. This includes funding in 2016 of scholarships for minority students pursuing degrees in engineering, said Senate Democrats, including Minority Leader Steve Henson of Tucker. A curious reader contacted PolitiFact weeks after the legislative session ended April 2, asking us to check if this were really true. "Where is it in the state budget?" she asked. PolitiFact promised to take a look. It took until Monday of this week, the day the governor signed the 2016 budget, for us to finally see the full picture. There is indeed money to fund scholarships for minority students who want to pursue degrees in engineering. There’s $3 million in fact. The money will be available in Fiscal Year 2016, which starts July 1, through the Georgia Student Finance Commission, best-known as the state agency overseeing the popular HOPE scholarship program. Qualifying minorities include females, African Americans, Hispanics and American Indians. These scholarships will be available to students at Georgia Tech, Kennesaw State, Georgia Southern, Mercer University and the University of Georgia, as well as qualifying dual-degree program students. For each $3,500 a student receives, he or she must commit to working in an engineering-related field in Georgia for one calendar year or repay the money in cash, plus interest. This is separate from an engineering scholarship program already available to Mercer University students. That program will cost the state about $1 million in 2016. But it’s obvious why the reader was skeptical. There is no reference to $3 million or any money in legislative budget documents. There is some budget language that says the program will operate with existing funds. That’s because, as we’ve been told, the Student Finance Authority will pay for the program with "revenue generated from the servicing and sale of student loans." The Georgia Student Finance Authority signed off on dedicating the $3 million to the scholarship program at a meeting earlier in the month in Statesboro. The vote though was contingent on the budget being signed by the governor, which, as we said, happened Monday. A 2012 study raised concerns about the representation of minority, women and economically disadvantaged business enterprises in construction and engineering contracts at the state DOT from 2009 t0 2011. Part of the DOT’s comeback was there aren’t enough minority engineers, Henson told PolitiFact. In negotiations on the transportation bill, in addition to the commitment to minority scholarships, Senate Democrats won concessions for more money for African-Americans and other minority road contractors, as well as a firmer pledge by the state DOT to steer more business toward minority-owned firms. The DOT board has already passed a resolution that Democrats have applauded related to contracts that will be issued in connection with the new transportation funding bill. Our conclusion Senate Democrats said they won concessions for their support of the transportation bill, including a commitment of funding for minority scholarships in engineering. The budget signed by the governor Monday includes a commitment of existing funds for that program. And based on action by the Georgia Student Finance Authority, the total amount will be $3 million. We rate the statement by Senate Democrats as True.	None	Senate Democrats	None	None	None	2015-05-13T00:00:00	2015-03-31	['None']
pomt-04880	"We have reduced funding for education the least. They've suffered the least cuts."	half-true	/georgia/statements/2012/aug/08/fran-millar/did-lawmaker-get-good-grade-education-claim/	For the first time in more than a decade, federal officials say, local school systems are contributing a larger percentage of public education funding than state governments. The Atlanta Journal-Constitution wrote about the change in a news article and in its Get Schooled blog. One state lawmaker who plays a key role in education spending insisted that Georgia has not shirked its responsibility to its students. Education spending on children from kindergarten to the 12th grade has not dramatically declined in recent years, said Fran Millar, chairman of the Georgia Senate’s Education and Youth Committee. "State revenue has gone down across the board," said Millar, a Republican state senator from Dunwoody. "We have reduced funding for education the least. They’ve suffered the least cuts." A PolitiFact Georgia reader asked us to examine Millar’s statement. We, too, wondered whether Millar had correctly done his homework on this point. Has the state cut education spending to a lesser degree than other parts of state government? Millar told us he was referring to the percentage of spending on education, since it is such a large portion of state spending. Georgia’s current 12-month spending plan for k-12 education is about $7.2 billion. Georgia’s current fiscal year budget is about $19 billion. The state of Georgia manages its money on a 12-month timetable that begins July 1 and ends June 30. Millar added in an email and during a telephone interview to emphasize his point that the state had not made drastic cuts in education spending. "It’s the least-touched major area" in terms of cuts, Millar said. A few days after we started to examine Millar’s statement, the AJC reported that Gov. Nathan Deal and his budget staff have asked departments to come up with an additional $553 million in budget cuts by the 2014 budget cycle. The major portion of public school funding is exempt, the AJC reported. The senator said he was thinking about the years since Deal took office or Sonny Perdue’s last year as governor when he made his claim to the AJC. He said spending may have even increased during those years. We followed his suggestion of examining data from the Georgia Office of Planning and Budget to calculate recent state spending. PolitiFact Georgia looked at state spending since Deal took office in 2011 and from 2009, the year after the Great Recession began making an impact on state and local budgets. Here’s the breakdown on education spending in recent fiscal years: FY 2009: $8.20 billion. FY 2010: $6.59 billion. FY 2011: $7.07 billion. FY 2012: $6.97 billion. FY 2013: $7.17 billion. We found several state agencies with a smaller percentage of budget cuts. We considered what Millar said about the sizable chunk of money spent on k-12 education and focused on departments with large budgets. PolitiFact Georgia examined spending among the 10 departments with the largest current budgets, including four with current budgets greater than $1 billion. The K-12 budget is still about 20 times greater than technical colleges, the department with the 10th-largest budget. First, let’s look at spending since Deal took office. The Education Department’s budget rose by slightly more than 1 percent between FY 2011 and the current budget. Not a great deal of change there and not a decrease. What about the two most recently completed budget cycles? Between FY 2011 and FY 2012, the Education Department’s budget declined by slightly more than 1 percent. Of the 10 departments with the largest budgets, that was the smallest decrease. Five departments had budget increases, some as high as about 15 percent, as was the case for the Department of Community Health. Let’s examine spending since the recession. Since FY 2009, the Education Department’s budget declined by 12.5 percent. Of those with billion-dollar budgets, the Corrections Department was the only one with a smaller decrease, which was about 3 percent. Two other departments with large budgets -- transportation and technical colleges -- also had smaller percentage decreases of 8.5 percent and 11.2 percent, respectively. Again, there were some departments with budget increases. Millar countered that the state had no choice but to increase spending in some areas, such as the Department of Community Health, which oversees Georgia’s Medicaid program. State officials estimate they’ll have to spend about $4 billion in coming years to comply with the federal health care law. Millar maintained he had a good argument, despite the spending increases for departments and smaller budget cuts in other areas. "On balance, if you look at the numbers, I still think it’s a fair statement," the senator said of his initial statement. So where does this leave us? Millar’s larger point is that the state has not made major cuts in education spending in comparison with other larger departments since Deal took office. The 1 percent cut in education spending between FY 2011 and FY 2012 was the smallest among 10 of Georgia’s largest departments and among those with billion-dollar budgets, which supports Millar’s quote in the AJC. Millar’s argument loses some steam when examining spending between FY 2009 and now. We found a few larger departments with smaller percentage cuts than education. Additionally, there are some large departments with budget increases. Millar’s quote is accurate on some levels, but there are some details we found that lower his grade-point average on this statement. We rate the senator’s claim Half True.

pomt-14377	"The right-wing extremists are trying to take this seat so they can push their anti-choice and anti-equality agenda through our State House."	pants on fire!	/pennsylvania/statements/2016/mar/18/brian-sims/are-right-wing-extremists-running-brian-sims-house/	Brian Sims has held Philadelphia’s 182nd District House seat since 2012, earning a reputation as a progressive in an area featuring a wide area of Center City. This year in the primary he will face Democratic candidates Louis Lanni, Marni Snyder and Ben Waxman. On Saturday, Sims’ camp sent a fundraising email to his supporters addressed from him in which he said, "I never expected to have this big of a target on my back. The right-wing extremists are trying to take this seat so they can push their anti-choice and anti-equality agenda through our State House." Though Sims has competition from Democrats in the primary, he does not have any from Republicans. No Republicans are on the ballot, according to the City Commissioners Office. And because no candidates are running as Republicans in the primary, no candidates can run as Republicans in the general election. None of the Democrats Sims is facing appear to be "right-wing extremists." Like Sims, Lanni is openly gay. He’s run as a Republican in the past, unsuccessfully, but has stated the importance of a hate crimes statute for Pennsylvania and describes himself as a moderate on his campaign’s official Facebook page. Waxman and Snyder have also promoted progressive issues, such as gay rights, increased education funding, school reform, women’s rights and criminal justice reform. "I don’t think any of us are right-wing extremists," Snyder said. Snyder, who described Sims’ email as "extremely poorly worded," said she received a call from Sims the day the email went out while she was out "knocking on doors" in the district. "He called my cell phone and said, ‘I want you to know that this email went out and was terribly worded,’" she said. Waxman also said Sims called him to apologize after sending the email. Lanni could not be reached for comment. Both Snyder and Waxman said they were not bothered by the email, citing their concerns for the district and their respective campaigns. Sims followed up his fundraising email the same day with another email saying he was "sincerely sorry for offending my challengers for the State House." He said in the email, "when I wrote about the right-wing extremists and their anti-choice, anti-equality agenda, I was referring to the Donald Trumps and Koch brothers of the world, not the Democrats running for my State House seat." Dan Siegel, a lead consultant on Sims’ campaign, said the original email was meant to capture the same meaning as the clarification email but was worded poorly. "It read another way to people," he said. Joe DeFelice, chairman of the Philadelphia Republican City Committee, called Sims’ actions "political puffing." "The people at the other end of his emails probably don't know what his district looks like," DeFelice said. "It's normal campaign rhetoric but frankly disingenuous in this point." Our ruling Democratic State Rep. Brian Sims sent a fundraising email to his supporters notifying them of an attack on his seat: "The right-wing extremists are trying to take this seat so they can push their anti-choice and anti-equality agenda through our State House." But no Republicans are running for his seat, and it’s too late for any to enter the race as Republicans. The three Democrats running against him are not "right-wing extremists." The clarification email sent the same day apologized for the word choices but doesn’t undo the statement that had been prepared, written and sent to followers, asking them for a donation.

pomt-13382	Says Marco Rubio "voted to slash school funding by billions of dollars and would eliminate the Department of Education."	mostly true	/florida/statements/2016/sep/27/afscme-people/unions-attack-marco-rubios-education-record/	Two liberal labor unions say that Sen. Marco Rubio’s priorities are wrong for Floridians. A TV ad by AFSCME People and AFT Solidarity accuses Rubio of favoring cuts to Social Security and Medicare and also says he "voted to slash school funding by billions of dollars and would eliminate the Department of Education." AFSCME represents public sector workers while AFT stands for American Federation of Teachers -- both unions endorsed Rubio’s opponent, U.S. Rep. Patrick Murphy, D-Jupiter, in the U.S. Senate contest. The ad is airing in the Tampa and Orlando media markets. We have previously fact-checked similar claims about Rubio’s position on Social Security and Medicare cuts and found them Half True. Here we will look at the education-related attacks that refer to his vote on the federal budget in 2011 and a statement he made on the presidential campaign trail in 2015. Education cuts The ad doesn’t explain the timeframe for the cuts, but the fine print cites a 2011 article by the liberal Center for American Progress. At the time, the Democrats and Republicans were in a budget stalemate about how to fund the federal government through the end of the fiscal year. That’s a reference to H.R. 1, legislation to fund appropriations through the end of 2011 that passed the House but was rejected by the Senate in a 44-56 vote on March 9, 2011. Rubio joined most of his Republican colleagues in voting in favor of it -- only three Republicans voted against it on the floor, and no Democrats voted for it. (Ultimately, the House, the Senate and the president agreed to a series of short-term "continuing resolutions" to keep the government going, rather than approving a more sweeping spending bill.) The legislation aimed to cut spending by about $57 billion -- including loads of cuts that had nothing to do with education. Republican leaders emphasized the broader aspects of the plan about reducing the size of government while Democrats emphasized the impact on education and disease research (the National Institutes of Health would also have been hit). In a statement after the vote, Rubio said that he supported the Republican plan but said more time should be spent to overhaul entitlements: "I supported this first step towards getting our fiscal house in order, but the truth is that America has reached a point where saving $57 billion is a mere drop in the bucket when compared to our $14 trillion debt. While reducing discretionary spending is an important goal, Washington is devoting a disproportionate amount of time to a tiny slice of the budget while ignoring the fact that continued inaction on saving Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid is bankrupting our country." Here are some examples of the education cuts: • Title I education spending. This is a program that sends federal funds to the states for K-12 education. H.R. 1 would have cut Title I spending by $693.5 million compared with the amount enacted for fiscal year 2010. • Part B IDEA grants. This program provides federal funding for special education based on a formula. H.R. 1 would have cut Part B spending by $557.7 million compared with the 2010 level. • Pell grants. This program funds low-income individuals pursuing undergraduate or sometimes graduate degrees. H.R. 1 would have capped the size of Pell grants for the 2011-12 award year at $4,015. Once that amount is adjusted for an additional sum provided under mandatory funding, the maximum level for Pell grants would be $845 lower than the 2011 level. • Head Start. This program provides low-income children of preschool age with child-development programs that teach skills that prepare them for school. H.R. 1 would have cut Head Start by a little under $1.1 billion. Education Department While campaigning for president in September 2015 in Carson City, Nev., Rubio said at a town hall, "I honestly think we don't need an Education Department." Rubio said that federal recommendations to state and local governments often turn into mandates tied to money. "What starts out as a suggestion ends up being, ‘If you want money from us, you must to do it this way,’ and you will end up with a version of a national school board," Rubio said. Democrats noted that Rubio’s college education was paid for in part by Pell Grants and Stafford Loans, which are administered by the Education Department. But Rubio said that federal programs that have merit could be transferred to other agencies. Although he wants to get rid of the education department, he supports efforts to make higher education affordable. Rubio also supports less federal involvement and more state and local control. For example, he introduced legislation that seeks to strengthen school choice for parents through a tax credit and he supports Florida’s tax credit scholarship program. We’ll note that Rubio has a lot of company among Republicans who want to eliminate the department. Such calls to ax the department are campaign rhetoric, said University of Iowa education professor David Bills. "Reagan back in 1980 would have loved to eliminate the DOE," Bills said. "I think it would be hard to find a major Republican now who doesn’t want to at least radically shrink it. .... All of that kind of slowed down when Bush II came in with No Child Left Behind. I think Rubio is pretty representative." Our ruling The TV ad by liberal groups says "Rubio voted to slash school funding by billions of dollars and would eliminate the Department of Education." Rubio, along with nearly all of his Republican Senate colleagues, voted for legislation in 2011 that would have cut about $57 billion in spending. The ad omits that this was across-the-board spending that didn’t solely target education, and it failed to pass. While a presidential candidate in 2015, Rubio did advocate eliminating the U.S. Education Department. The ad omits that he said he would move worthwhile programs to other agencies.

pomt-13351	"A rural hospital in Missouri closes every 8 months. The legislature’s failure to expand Medicaid has brought crisis to many of Missouri’s rural health care providers."	half-true	/missouri/statements/2016/oct/03/chris-koster/koster-leaves-out-facts-medicaid-statement/	As we move into the final weeks before the Nov. 8 election, Democratic gubernatorial nominee and Attorney General Chris Koster is making a point to separate his political stances from the actions of the Missouri General Assembly. In a graphic posted on Instagram, Koster’s campaign wrote, "The legislature’s failure to expand Medicaid has brought crisis to many of Missouri’s rural health care providers." To support that, the post stated: "A rural hospital in Missouri closes every 8 months." That sounded pretty dramatic, so we decided to look into the claim. The post referred to research done by the Cecil G. Sheps Center for Health Services Research at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. The Koster campaign also directed us to an article from the Springfield News-Leader. What we found in examining the evidence is that not every hospital Koster cited is "rural," and the hospitals closed for a variety of reasons. Cecil G. Sheps Center Report The Sheps Center has tracked hospital closings in the continental United States since 2010. In that amount of time, three rural Missouri hospitals have closed, the center reports. The Sac-Osage Hospital in Osceola closed in September 2014, the Parkland Health Center Weber Road in Farmington closed in January, and the SoutheastHEALTH Center of Reynolds County in Ellington closed in March. Koster’s campaign also directed our attention to the Ozarks Community Hospital in Springfield, which closed its surgery department and emergency room in July. The Ozarks Community Hospital is not considered a rural hospital because it’s located in Springfield, population 160,000. The hospital contained 45 beds, plus 10 more in its geriatric psychiatry unit, a small number for a city of that size. If we start counting in September of 2014, these four closings work out to approximately one every eight months. But, again, while the Ozarks Community Hospital is small, it’s not rural. Medicaid According to Ryan Barker at the Missouri Foundation for Health, Missouri could have expanded Medicaid starting Jan. 1, 2014, before any of the hospitals closed. Expanding Medicaid would have had a significant impact on the reimbursement of health care providers. Dave Dillon, a spokesman for the Missouri Hospital Association, told St. Louis Public Radio that the legislature’s decision to not expand Medicaid will cost Missouri $4 billion in federal payments over the next six years. Under the Affordable Care Act, states were given the opportunity to expand the pool of citizens covered by Medicaid, a subsidized insurance for citizens living in poverty. The federal government would have covered the entire costs of the broadened coverage for the first three years, but the level of federal subsidy would decline after that. Legislators in Missouri and 18 other states chose not to expand Medicaid, in part because of the greater costs to the state, but also because of ideological opposition to subsidized insurance and Obamacare. Since many rural hospitals were already in crisis before 2014 because of a large burden of uninsured patients, the failure to expand Medicaid isn’t the direct cause for closings. However, Medicaid expansion was a missed opportunity to lessen the load on those affected hospitals. Why the hospitals closed In an article from the Kansas Health Institute News Service, Chris Smiley, the CEO of the Sac-Osage hospital, said the hospital was forced to close because of a large amount of uninsured patients and shrinking payments from Medicare. "Hospitals expected to see millions of newly insured customers thanks to federal subsidies enabling people to buy health insurance and the expansion of state Medicaid programs," explained the article. "In exchange, they agreed to accept reduced Medicare payments and a huge cut in disproportionate share hospital, or DSH, funding, which the federal government pays to offset the costs of uncompensated care." Since Missouri opted out of Medicaid expansion, this left the hospital with a gap in reimbursement. The closest hospital to Osceola is now Ellett Memorial Hospital in Appleton City, 30 minutes away. Parkland Health Center Weber Road officials were much less specific in their explanation, but said that concerns about building safety and regulations factored in the decision to close. Most of the hospital’s services, including emergency care, have since been relocated to other Parkland Health facilities, also located in Farmington. SoutheastHEALTH was forced to close because of a $6 million debt owed by Advanced Healthcare, the previous owner of the hospital. As the owners of the property, state Medicaid officials informed the company that it was liable for the debt. The nearest hospital to Ellington is now the Iron County Hospital in Pilot Knob. Ozarks Community Hospital was forced to close its ER and surgery center because the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services determined it did not have a large enough inpatient population to be considered a hospital. Since approximately 40 percent of the hospital’s patients were uninsured and it was being paid less money to treat them, the hospital was only able to admit patients following surgery by 2015, according to OCH Health System owner and CEO Paul Taylor in a Springfield News-Leader article. He said there is "no doubt in my mind" that the hospital would have stayed open if Missouri had expanded Medicaid. The Ozarks Community Hospital now functions as a clinic. Our ruling Koster said, "A rural hospital in Missouri closes every 8 months. The legislature’s failure to expand Medicaid has brought crisis to many of Missouri’s rural health care providers." Koster’s claim is a bit of stretch. Four small Missouri hospitals have closed entirely or in part since September 2014, three of which are rural. In half those cases, patients being unable to pay their bills was cited as a reason for the closure. And many of those patients likely would have been covered had Missouri expanded Medicaid. Koster’s statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details. We rate it Half True. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/777d846a-33b3-42b6-8f88-49d665f6fe6a	None	Chris Koster	None	None	None	2016-10-03T09:54:56	2016-08-09	['Missouri']
pomt-05397	Say that under state law, "systems development charges can only be spent on capital investment."	true	/oregon/statements/2012/may/05/charlie-hales/can-system-development-charges-be-spent-capital-pr/	Hard to believe, but we have another fact check on systems development charges. After all, there was no way Charlie Hales was going to take criticism lightly on the wonky subject. Hales pointed out to Jefferson Smith that development charges have nothing to do with maintenance, which is what the question was about. "Actually, Jefferson," Hales said, "under state law, and it’s something you should know, systems development charges can only be spent on capital investment. They can’t be spent on maintenance. We have a maintenance problem. That’s a different pot of revenue. It’s not what systems development charges pays for." Smith argued that if we’re not collecting systems development charges to pay for capital construction related to growth then that money has to come out of the general fund that should be used to pay for maintenance. Who’s right? Smith is flatly inaccurate in suggesting the law has changed. (He and his campaign later clarified that he did not mean to suggest the law had changed.) Oregon Revised Statutes, says systems development charges may be used only for "capital improvement." That improvement "does not include the costs of the operation or routine maintenance of capital improvements." We find Hales’ statement True.

pomt-07883	Says the Texas Forest Service planted 6,000 trees in the Dallas/Fort Worth area before the Super Bowl for unknown reasons at an unknown cost.	half-true	/texas/statements/2011/feb/06/michael-sullivan/michael-sullivan-says-texas-forest-service-planted/	Super Bowls often have off-the-field twists. On Feb. 3, conservative activist Michael Quinn Sullivan of Austin arched his brow about preparations for Super Bowl XLV, set for Sunday in Cowboys Stadium, writing in a Twitter post: "Your Texas Forest Service planted 6,000 trees in (Dallas/Fort Worth) area in advance of Super Bowl. Cost? Unknown. Why? Same. " Asked to elaborate, Sullivan replied via Twitter that he’d learned of the trees from a Capitol newsletter, Texas Insider. Its Feb. 3 edition includes an item stating the forest service plans to help the bowl go smoothly by mobilizing an incident management team. It closes: "In addition, the agency prepared for the coming deluge of tourists by planting more than 6,000 trees in Arlington and surrounding cities." Really? By e-mail, a service spokeswoman, April Saginor, told us the agency put $50,000 toward planting trees in a dozen North Texas host cities, which we later identified as Addison, Arlington, Dallas, Denton, Farmers Branch, Fort Worth, Frisco, Grapevine, Irving, Lewisville, Plano and Richardson. The idea, Saginor said, was to partner with the NFL, the Texas Trees Foundation and other agencies "to lessen environmental impacts of hosting the Super Bowl and improve the environment and quality of life in the area." A service press release quotes Jack Groh, director of the NFL’s environmental program, saying his agency has been facilitating environmental projects for Super Bowl host cities for 17 years. "This was the most extensive urban forestry project ever in the history" of such Super Bowl projects, Groh said. "This had more of a reach and more of an impact than we’ve ever had." In interviews, Groh and Janette Monear, executive director of the Dallas-rooted trees foundation, told us more than 6,500 trees were planted this past year in public spaces and near schools. Monear said the forest service’s $50,000 grant, consisting of federal aid, was matched by private donations gathered by the foundation. Groh told us the trees "actually do something for the local climate, whether it’s reducing pollution" by absorbing carbon dioxide "or lowering the temperature a little bit with shade." Given how quickly we were able to track down such details, we wondered if the tree project was "unknown" to denizens of the host cities. Democratic activist Phillip Martin of Austin, who poked at Sullivan’s Twitter message the night it launched, guided us to a Jan. 13 Fort Worth Star-Telegram news article previewing an Arlington luncheon, emceed by Cowboys’ great Drew Pearson, celebrating the plantings. And on Jan. 21, our online search showed, the Dallas Morning News published a news article quoting Groh and Arlington Mayor Richard Cluck, who said: "There are so many advantages to having the Super Bowl in your town ... and one of the big ones is the environmental program. There’s nothing more important to me, and it should be to you, to grow our tree population." The Dallas newspaper said in a Jan. 28 news article that the tree plantings are expected to touch off other planting programs. The story says the foundation "already has a deal with the city of Richardson to plant 50,000 trees, and this spring, the group will launch an initiative to put 3 million trees in North Texas soil." The story quotes Monear as saying: "It’s a legacy project. This growth is going to benefit the region for many years." So, 6,000 trees planted, as Sullivan says? That’s about right. At an unknown cost? For an unknown purpose? Not so, times two. Besides, "your Forest Service," as Sullivan puts it, didn’t plant the trees by its lonesome. Moreover, half the expenses were covered by private donations. We rate the statement Half True.	None	Michael Sullivan	None	None	None	2011-02-06T06:00:00	2011-02-03	['Super_Bowl']
pomt-07695	In slashing $1.7 billion from Social Security, "Rep. Jim Renacci may end up forcing the entire agency to ... shut down for a month, causing seniors to not get their benefits on time, halting claims processing, and forcing new retirees and disabled workers into a backlog."	mostly false	/ohio/statements/2011/mar/07/democratic-congressional-campaign-committee/dccc-says-rep-jim-renacci-house-gop-would-force-so/	The GOP spending plan that passed the House of Representatives on Feb. 19 won’t become law because Democrats who control the U.S. Senate and hold the White House won’t let it become law. But that won’t stop Democrats from using its hypothetical cuts as campaign points. House Republicans say the cuts they approved show they’re serious about tightening the government’s belt and cracking down on pork-barrel spending. Democratic critics say its provisions would destroy thousands of jobs and undermine everything from education to food safety. Since passage of the spending package, the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee has dispatched a steady drumbeat of news releases targeting GOP supporters on aspects they believe will be politically unpopular. A Feb. 22 missive titled "Representative Jim Renacci and House Republicans Vote to Cut Social Security and Delay Benefits" made the following claim: "In slashing $1.7 billion from the Social Security Administration, Rep. Jim Renacci may end up forcing the entire agency to have to shut down for a month, causing seniors to not get their benefits on time, halting claims processing, and forcing new retirees and disabled workers into a backlog before seeing their benefits." It sounded like a draconian enough accusation for PolitiFact Ohio to check out. The news release attributes its projections to Democrats on the House Ways and Means Committee, who estimated the cuts would force month-long furloughs at SSA, and an assessment by National Committee to Preserve Social Security and Medicare CEO Barbara Kennelly, formerly a Democratic member of the House of Representatives from Connecticut. Kennelly said that further cuts in Social Security funding would mean seniors would have to wait longer to get an appointment to file for benefits, would not receive timely benefit decisions or have their documents processed promptly, and that significant numbers of SSA employees would be furloughed. But the Democrats’ $1.7 billion figure uses the $12.5 billion that President Barack Obama proposed for the Social Security budget for 2011 as the baseline from which they claim cuts are being made. But that money was never allotted because no 2011 budget was passed. SSA has operated at the same $11.5 billion funding level it got in 2010. Republicans use $11.5 billion as a baseline to cite a lower level of cuts. Renacci spokeswoman Karin Davenport says the GOP bill would lop $125 million in administrative cuts from the agency’s 2010 spending level. More cuts would come from rescinding another $118 million from a computer center that’s not scheduled to be built until 2015, and from reclaiming $500 million from a "reserve" fund that Democrats say is already being tapped. If we set aside $1 billion of the Social Security cuts Democrats cite as phantom cuts coming from a budget that never materialized, that still leaves $700,000 that are acknowledged by both Republicans and Democrats. SSA did not return repeated telephone calls we made to determine the impact of those cuts. In their absence, we turned to Witold Skwierczynski , who heads the American Federation of Government Employees union that represents most of the nation’s SSA workers. While SSA isn’t talking to reporters, it is talking to his union. Skwierczynski says SSA has told the union that if Congress reduces Social Security’s funding at all beneath FY 2010 levels, some level of furloughs would be imposed. SSA sent the union a letter on Feb. 17 that requested bargaining over the possible implementation of furloughs, though it didn’t specify how long the furloughs might last. "It is important to note that the Commissioner has not decided to effectuate a furlough," the letter said. "However, given the potential of reduced Congressional appropriations for the remainder of the fiscal year, the Agency is issuing this notice at this time in the event that a furlough may become necessary." Skwierczynski says Obama requested a $1 billion increase in SSA’s 2011 funding because of increased demands for its services, and called potential passage of the GOP budget "a nightmare scenario for Social Security." "You have to understand that we are a growth agency," he said. "We are taking more and more claims because of the baby boom generation’s retirement and also because of the economic problems we have in this country. If people are laid off, they will file for retirement early. Many will file for disability, looking for a benefit they can receive to enable them to survive with out a job." If SSA workers are furloughed because of budget cuts or a government shutdown, beneficiaries would still get their regularly scheduled checks, Skweirczynski said. But furloughs would mean fewer workers available to process new claims and appeals. That would result in backlogs and delays in processing new paperwork. That’s what happened when furloughs were implemented during the government shutdowns of 1995 and 1996. Where does that leave Democrats’ claims about Renacci? Their $1.7 billion figure overstates the potential budget cut by about $1 billion because it uses Obama’s budget proposal as a baseline, although that budget was never implemented. The GOP proposal still would lead to a significant reduction from an agency with a $11.5 billion budget. The AFGE union and correspondence from SSA agree that furloughs would likely result if the GOP budget proposal were implemented. But SSA’s letter to the union makes clear that no decision has been made on how to implement furloughs. There’s no way to determine whether those furloughs might last a month, as Democrats insist, and encompass the entire agency. Past SSA furloughs did delay some services for beneficiaries, but the entire agency was never shut down - as Democrats said might happen. Swierczynski said skeleton staffs maintained beneficiary records during a five day shutdown in 1995, and a larger crew of "essential employees" kept working in processing centers during a three week shutdown in 1996. Swierczynski told us regularly scheduled benefit checks would continue, but new claims and appeals could be backlogged and delayed. There are some elements of truth in the DCCC’s claim, but it stokes it up with hyperbole and leaves out several critical facts that would give listeners a different impression. On the Truth-O-Meter, that means Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.

pomt-12901	"Our Navy has shrunk from more than 500 ships in 1991 to 275 in 2016."	mostly true	/florida/statements/2017/jan/20/donald-trump/trump-says-navy-has-shrunk-dramatically-1991/	President Donald Trump has vowed to rebuild the U.S. military, which he said during his inauguration speech represented a "sad depletion." A page on foreign policy on the newly revamped Trump White House website includes some statistics about a shrinking military: "Our Navy has shrunk from more than 500 ships in 1991 to 275 in 2016. Our Air Force is roughly one-third smaller than in 1991. President Trump is committed to reversing this trend, because he knows that our military dominance must be unquestioned." The size of the Navy’s fleet has been a familiar talking point at least during the past two presidential campaigns. But many of the past claims we have fact-checked compared the fleet to 1917, or 100 years ago, when technology was considerably different. Trump’s claim is a more reasonable comparison. We found that his numbers are correct, and that there are valid concerns about the size of the Navy. The Obama administration supported an increase in the number of ships. Navy fleet size A Trump spokesman referred us to a Navy website, which shows the annual number of ships dating back to 1886. Trump’s numbers are accurate: In 1991 there were 529 total active ships, and in 2016 there were 275. The number of ships peaked at 6,768 during World War II. Then the number drifted down during most of the 20th century, with slight upticks during the Korean War and the Vietnam War. The number fluctuates a bit during each year as ships are rotated into and out of service. Lance Janda, a military historian at Cameron University, said Trump's claim requires further explanation. "The thing is, numbers are not everything," Janda said. "Ships today are much more expensive and more powerful than in the past, so it’s not like our Navy is less capable than it was in 1991. And it’s also a question of what kind of ships you want to have. We tend to have smaller numbers of really expensive, really capable ships. That’s nice when they work. It’s bad if you lose any." While the size of the fleet has shrunk, it remains powerful compared with other countries. "We remain the dominant Navy on the planet. Period," Janda said. "I’d like to see us go with less expensive ships so we can have more of them myself, but it’s not like we’re in danger of being surpassed as a naval power. We face much greater threats in the realms of cyberwar, space war and nuclear weapons than we do at sea." Michael O'Hanlon, a security expert at the Brookings Institution, a centrist-to-liberal group, agreed with that assessment. "The point is that no single metric captures all important trends," he said. "And the Navy has chosen to put more size, technology, and money into a smaller number of ships as a matter of policy. And our aggregate tonnage is still almost three times China’s." But Naval War College professor James Holmes said there are valid concerns about the Navy’s assets. (Holmes said he was speaking on behalf of himself and not the college.) Navy leadership estimates it only has enough supply to meet 50 to 60 percent of the demand from U.S. regional commands around the world, he said. It’s more complex than just looking at the sheer number of ships, he said. The first step is to determine how many ships are needed to deploy for a particular situation -- for example if the United States gets into a scrap in the South China Sea. Then, if the Navy has a sufficient amount of naval power, then the Navy can handle that contingency. "Technology has advanced in areas like electronic or cyber warfare and missile defense, so we're stronger in those areas," Holmes said. "But we let a lot of basic skills and technologies atrophy after the Soviet Navy's demise in 1991. With no apparent foe to fight, we neglected combat skills such as fighting other surface fleets or hunting submarines." Holmes was in the Navy of 1991 in a ship that carried Tomahawk anti-ship missiles that were able to strike at enemy vessels hundreds of miles away. "That no longer exists, and we are worse off for it," he said. "We converted all of those Tomahawks for land missions, e.g., strikes against ISIS today or Saddam's military in 2003." A review by the conservative Heritage Foundation of the military branches concluded that the Navy scored strong in readiness but that deferred maintenance is beginning to affect deployment. Brian Slattery, Heritage Foundation’s Center for National Defense policy analyst, said that those who decry ship count as a valid measure of power "discount that our adversaries’ and competitors’ navies have advanced, as well. "Even though American aircraft carriers are launching more sophisticated aircraft than they were decades ago, competitors such as China and Russia have developed new technologies to deny those carriers access to waters in their regions, including advanced anti-ship ballistic missiles, quiet diesel submarines, and their own modern aviation assets." Former President Barack Obama has already begun the process of growing the Navy. The Obama White House embraced a long-term plan that would elevate the Navy to 300 active ships in 2019 and keep it at or above that level through 2045. The Navy completed a formal review process in 2014 to consider its future military needs, and then in March 2015 set a goal for a fleet of 308 ships. In December 2016, the secretary of the Navy announced a recommendation of a 355-ship fleet and plans to include that in the Navy’s Fiscal Year 2018 30-year shipbuilding plan. Our ruling The Trump White House website says that "our Navy has shrunk from more than 500 ships in 1991 to 275 in 2016." Trump’s numbers are correct according to a document from the Navy, which shows the annual size of the fleet. However, sheer numbers do not tell the full story. The ships of today are more powerful than those in 1991. The United States remains the world's most powerful Navy. We rate this claim Mostly True.

pomt-00465	"The teachers in (charter) schools don't even have to be certified."	mostly false	/florida/statements/2018/aug/15/gwen-graham/graham-misspeaks-charter-school-teacher-certificat/	Former U.S. Rep. Gwen Graham has promoted public education as her top priority in her campaign for governor, and she has openly criticized the charter school industry for drawing money away from traditional public schools. In an interview with editorial boards from major South Florida newspapers, Graham argued that some charter schools in Florida provided a subpar education. She said, "The teachers in (charter) schools don't even have to be certified." Charter schools operate as independent contractors within the public school system. These schools generally have more freedom to experiment than traditional public schools. Many are catered to specific subjects, like science or art, and some are organized for students with disabilities. However, with that increased freedom, charter schools are required to perform to a certain standard, and may be shut down if they fail. Most charter schools in Florida are run by the same statutes that govern public schools, and would therefore need certified teachers. But does Florida hold all charter schools to the same regulations? Depends on the charter According to the Florida Department of Education, most charter school teachers are required to be certified. The certification process is mandated by the Florida K-20 Education Code, a subset of the 2018 Florida Statutes. Statute 1002.33 reads, "Teachers employed by or under contract to a charter school shall be certified as required by chapter 1012." Statute 1012, the same rule that governs traditional public schools, requires teachers to "hold the certificate required by law and by rules of the State Board of Education" in order to teach. However, certification is not mandatory for a subset of Florida charter schools, called the "schools of hope." These charter schools operate within underserved districts that have "persistently low-performing schools." The legislature hoped to attract successful charter organizations from other states by offering financial incentives and increased administrative freedom. Gov. Rick Scott signed the controversial bill, known as HB 7069, into law in July 2017. Graham did not specify in her interview with the editorial boards that she was referring to these schools. Her campaign clarified when we contacted them, and linked us to the bill. According to HB 7069, "schools of hope" can hire administrators and "instructional personnel" who do not meet the requirements for public school teachers, so long as they have not been convicted of any felonies or other serious crimes. Instructional personnel include lead classroom teachers. To obtain a Florida teaching certificate, teachers must have a bachelor’s degree and complete several state accreditation tests. Most notable are the Florida Teacher Certification examinations, which include a general knowledge test, a professional education test, and a subject area test. A school of hope teacher would not be required to pass any of these tests. As of August 2018, no "schools of hope" have opened in Florida. Four companies have been approved as "hope operators," but none intend to begin operation for this school year. Thirteen counties have filed a lawsuit against HB 7069, arguing that it restricts the rights of districts to operate freely and violates the constitutional right to a uniform system of public schools. "Gwen believes charter schools must be held to the same standards as traditional public schools and, as governor, will fully enforce certification requirements," said Graham campaign spokesman Matt Harringer in an email. Our ruling Graham said that "The teachers in (charter) schools don't even have to be certified." At every charter school currently operating in Florida, teachers are held to the same certification standards as they would be in public schools. At "schools of hope," a recently introduced subset of charter schools, teachers will not need to be certified. Even when these schools begin operation, they will make up only a small percentage of the state's 654 existing charter schools. It is misleading to say that teachers in charter schools don't have to be certified when the vast majority of them do. We rate this claim Mostly False.

pomt-13897	"Thanks to (North Carolina’s) governor and the legislature, the average teacher salary can barely support a family."	mostly false	/north-carolina/statements/2016/jun/28/hillary-clinton/hillary-clinton-wrongly-places-full-blame-nc-teach/	In a speech in Raleigh on Wednesday, Hillary Clinton laid out her plan for improving the economy and reducing income inequality. But she segued into local politics, too, seeking to boost the campaigns of North Carolina Democrats like Roy Cooper, who is running for governor against Republican incumbent Pat McCrory. Teacher pay was her weapon of choice for hitting the state’s Republican leaders. Clinton was introduced at her rally by a Durham teacher and by former Gov. Jim Hunt, a Democrat known for his education initiatives. "You know, for many years, thanks to people and leaders like Jim Hunt, North Carolina was a leading state when it came to education," Clinton said. "Now, unfortunately, thanks to your governor and the legislature, the average teacher salary can barely support a family." There are two things here that made our ears perk up. Can the average teacher "barely support a family" on his or her salary? And if not, is it the fault of McCrory and the state’s Republican-controlled legislature? How much teachers make The average North Carolina public school teacher made $47,819 in 2014-15 according to the National Education Association, an advocacy group. Both the NEA and the N.C. Department of Public Instruction have estimated the average teacher this school year is making just shy of $48,000. That’s the equivalent of slightly more than $23 per hour when adjusted to 40 hours a week, 52 weeks a year. That’s not the schedule teachers work, but we’ll use it for the sake of comparison since it’s what most people are familiar with. North Carolina’s cost of living What does it mean to be barely able to support a family? Clinton’s campaign didn’t respond on the record, but there are a few ways of looking at it. The average teacher’s salary is more than triple the minimum wage. It’s also enough to keep a family of nine out of poverty. For a more traditional family of four, it’s about double the poverty level. But the government’s poverty guidelines have faced criticism for being outdated and/or inaccurate. So what about other ways of measuring ways to support a family? MIT professor Amy Glasmeier created something called the Living Wage Calculator. It takes local-level data on taxes, rent, transportation, food, child care and other costs into account. The formula also assumes non-working adults are providing full-time child care. Glasmeier has written that it shows "the minimum level of income required for individuals and families to pay for basic living expenses" – a pretty good approximation of what Clinton was talking about. A single parent making the average teacher’s salary could support one child but would struggle to support two children, according to the living wage calculations. Likewise, if the teacher is married with a child, an average salary could easily support the child and a stay-at-home spouse. The salary would still be considered a living wage even if that couple had a second child – here it gets to the level of barely enough – but not if they had a third child and the spouse remained unemployed. But we didn’t want to just take a calculator’s word for it. So we asked a professor who studies poverty and politics, Duke University’s Anirudh Krishna. He agreed that a teacher’s salary can provide for a family’s basic needs but not much more. "An annual salary of $48,000 is less than what typically makes for significant intergenerational upward mobility," Krishna said. "Rents or mortgages usually make up for half of that amount, and food and fuel account for much of the rest, leaving relatively little for a rainy day, far less for a child’s college education." So this part of Clinton’s claim could be accurate or not, depending on how big the family in question is and what you consider to be barely supporting that family – whether it’s simply keeping the children out of poverty or being able to do more. But is Clinton right to pin the blame on Republicans for not giving teachers even higher salaries? Political blame Since 2010, the average teacher has earned right around the state’s median household income. Republicans took control of the state legislature in January 2011. In most states, teachers make more. North Carolina is one of the 10 lowest-paying states for teachers, and inflation-adjusted salaries have dropped 10.2 percent in the last decade, according to the NEA. Only three states saw teachers’ salaries fall by more between 2004-05 and 2014-15. Who is responsible? Both political parties have seen teacher pay rise and fall under their watch in the last decade, although Democrats were in power most of that time. Under Democratic Gov. Mike Easley average teacher pay grew by thousands of dollars, to $48,454 in 2008-09, his last year in office. Then the Great Recession happened and in 2009-10, Democratic Gov. Bev Perdue ordered a pay cut for state employees and teachers. That cut was approved by a Democrat-led legislature, and average teacher pay continued to fall every year under Perdue. Republicans were in charge of the statehouse the last two years of Perdue’s term. Both years, Perdue vetoed the budget and said more money should’ve been spent on education, but to no avail. Average teacher pay continued dropping after she left office. It reached its lowest point in McCrory’s first budget – the third year of GOP legislative control – when it dipped below $45,000 to 47th in the nation in 2013-14. But since then, teacher pay has been rising. It’s still not yet back to pre-recession levels, but it could be next year. The House, Senate and McCrory’s office have all said teachers ought to earn more than $50,000 on average in 2016-17. Our ruling Clinton said the average North Carolina teacher’s salary "can barely support a family" and placed the blame squarely on Gov. Pat McCrory and Republican legislators. The average teacher salary of just less than $48,000 is higher than what most households around the state make per year. Yet it’s also right around what’s considered the bare minimum "living wage" for a couple with two kids. Clinton, however, muddles the political blame. Average teacher pay did hit its lowest point when Republicans controlled both the governor’s office and General Assembly. Yet the only actual salary cuts happened under Democratic control. And more recently, Republicans have raised teacher pay almost back to pre-recession levels.

pomt-07158	Workers who pick produce in Georgia’s fields can make $12 to $18 an hour.	half-true	/georgia/statements/2011/jun/14/gary-black/some-farm-workers-do-earn-high-wages-not-all-do/	Recent talk about a shortage of workers in Georgia’s fields left your PolitiFact team wondering whether we should consider a career in cucumbers. The work may be hard, but if you believe Agriculture Commissioner Gary Black, the industry pays solid wages. "Understand that these are $12, $13, $14, $16, $18 an hour jobs," Black told 90.1 WABE-FM’s Denis O'Hayer in an interview. "Talked to a gentleman yesterday, they had a crew of people, they were going to make $130 a day picking cucumbers. That’s 130 buckets of cucumbers, $1 per bucket." Up to $18 an hour? That’s more lucrative than flipping burgers or greeting customers at Walmart. Suddenly, picking cucumbers seemed like a viable Plan B. If Black is right, farm labor could be a neat answer to Georgia’s joblessness problems. Unemployment remains high at 9.9 percent. GA DOL Farmers complain their immigrant labor force is leaving the state to avoid racial and ethnic profiling, harassment, or deportation they think will result from House Bill 87, Georgia’s Arizona-style immigration crackdown. HB 87 requires that certain employers check their new workers’ immigration status and gives law enforcement officers more leeway to check a suspect’s immigration status. Gov. Nathan Deal signed the bill May 13, but it’s being challenged in federal court. Farmers report they’ve already lost thousands of dollars because they can’t find enough laborers. Black and others told us that field worker wages are often based on production. The more you harvest, the more money you get. "They range from minimum wage to as high as $18," Black told PolitiFact Georgia. He cited instances where farmers told him solid workers could make even more. But can job seekers reasonably expect to make $12 to $18 an hour? First, a note about harvesting jobs. A lot of them are temporary, and hours vary depending on Mother Nature. Laborers may have to work for 12 hours or more to pick a crop before it rots. Reporters for The Atlanta Journal-Constitution interviewed workers and farmers who said pickers earned about $100 a day. One worker said she expected to work about 12 hours for that amount. The most recent Georgia Department of Labor data date from the summer of 2010. The state tallied wage and employee numbers from farms with 10 or more employees who are covered by regular unemployment insurance. Such employers are required to report their numbers to the state. For 13 weeks during July, August and September, 10,600 or so workers in Georgia were involved in "crop production," or worked in farms, orchards, groves, greenhouses and nurseries that grow crops or plants. This group can include supervisors. They made an average of $367 per week, the data show. Pay varied depending on the crop. For instance, some 3,100 vegetable and melon workers made an average of $311 a week; about 1,000 blueberry and other non-strawberry crop workers made about $268; soybean crop workers (there were only 17) made about $666. The state Department of Labor did not determine an average hourly wage, so we did our own rough calculation. Although field workers often work 12-hour days, we based our figures on a 40-hour workweek to be conservative. We found that crop workers make about $9.18 an hour. Vegetable and melon workers were near $7.78. Blueberry workers made about $6.70 an hour. The soybean rate is $16.65, but that is for workers operating complex farm machinery, a relatively small number of workers. These numbers were lower than Black’s figures, so we turned to the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s farm labor data for additional verification. They calculate regional wage rates for "field workers," or employees who plant, tend or harvest crops. We looked at spring and summer wages for the Southeast, which includes Georgia, Alabama and South Carolina. Field workers made $8.86 per hour during the week of April 11 through 17, 2010. They made $9.12 an hour July 11 through 17, 2010. The federal figures were also lower than Black’s, so we consulted another source: former field worker Andrea Hinojosa, who opposes the immigration crackdown. She is director of Southeast Georgia Communities Project Inc., which provides health, education and other services to farm laborers. The onion pickers Hinojosa serves generally make 38 cents for each bucket, she said. Fast, experienced workers can make $9.50 or $10 an hour. It may be possible to make $12 an hour picking onions, Hinojosa said, but it’s rare. $18 an hour is far-fetched. "I’ve got to tell you, I’ve never seen, never heard of someone making $18 an hour," Hinojosa said. In sum, it is possible to make $12 to $18 an hour, as Black said, but those amounts are far higher than a typical wage. Information from state and federal agencies, the director of a farmworker aid group, and AJC reporters shows wages are closer to $10 an hour or less. Black’s statement is accurate on its face. Some farm workers "can" earn $12 to $18 an hour. Most, however, do not. His statement leaves out key details and takes things out of context. This is our definition of Half True.

"Democrats go full tyranny: now demand nationwide gun confiscation from law-abiding Americans ... at gunpoint, of course," stated a May 7 headline on RevolutionRadio.org, which copied the story and headline by NaturalNews.com. Facebook flagged this story as part of its efforts to combat false news and misinformation on Facebook's News Feed. You can read more about our partnership with Facebook here. The headline blows out of proportion statements by U.S. Rep. Eric Swalwell, who represents the San Francisco Bay area. You may not realize this, but as a nonprofit news organization, we depend on — and answer to — you. Your support directly impacts our abilility to provide objective, factual reporting on issues that matter. Donate now to our Spring Campaign and go on the record as saying facts matter! Swalwell, a former prosecutor, wrote a USA Today op-ed calling for the United States to get rid of assault weapons. He wrote about the deadly outcomes of being fired at by such a weapon. "Trauma surgeons and coroners will tell you the high-velocity bullet fired from a military-style, semiautomatic assault weapon moves almost three times as fast as a 9mm handgun bullet, delivering far more energy. The bullets create cavities through the victim, wrecking a wider swath of tissue, organs and blood vessels. And a low-recoil weapon with a higher-capacity magazine means more of these deadlier bullets can be fired accurately and quickly without reloading." Swalwell said that reinstating the federal assault weapons ban that was in effect from 1994 to 2004 would prohibit manufacture and sales, but it would still leave millions of assault weapons on the streets. "Instead, we should ban possession of military-style semiautomatic assault weapons, we should buy back such weapons from all who choose to abide by the law, and we should criminally prosecute any who choose to defy it by keeping their weapons," he wrote. "The ban would not apply to law enforcement agencies or shooting clubs." The NaturalNews story said that Swalwell "actually wants to see door-to-door gun confiscation teams engage in Nazi-style removal tactics in order to rid the streets of all firearms that he personally deems reckless and unnecessary." We saw no evidence in Swalwell’s op-ed that he wants law enforcement to use such a tactic. We asked his spokeswoman how he would envision law enforcement obtaining such assault weapons. "The Congressman supports an assault weapon buy-back period, and then limiting any weapons not sold back to licensed clubs and ranges, with a ban on possession anywhere else," Caitlyn McNamee said in an email. "He has never proposed and does not support door-to-door searches, which would be unworkable, unsafe, and – without a warrant – unconstitutional. But anyone found to be in possession of such a weapon after the buyback period has elapsed would be in violation of the law to possess and subject to prosecution." On his congressional website, Swalwell doesn’t propose any sort of widespread gun confiscation. While calling for more gun control measures, including improving background checks and an assault weapons ban, he has also stated support for the Second Amendment. "I am the son and brother of hunters and gun owners," he wrote. I know that guns can be used responsibly and the Second Amendment provides individuals certain rights to own firearms." A headline said that "Democrats go full tyranny: now demand nationwide gun confiscation from law-abiding Americans ... at gunpoint, of course." The story that followed wasn’t broadly about Democrats, but rather about one Democrat: U.S. Rep. Eric Swalwell. He proposed getting rid of assault weapons, but didn’t call for confiscating all guns.

pomt-10433	Eliminating earmarks "would make barely a drop in the bucket with regard to the national debt, the deficit."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/may/13/bob-barr/billions-of-difference-amounts-to-not-much/	When he announced May 12, 2008, that he was seeking the Libertarian Party nomination for president, former GOP Rep. Bob Barr of Georgia blasted his former party for running up the federal budget deficit during the last eight years. Barr added that he wasn't about to give likely Republican presidential nominee Sen. John McCain any reprieve merely because the Arizona senator is a longtime opponent of so-called pork barrel spending. Opposition to earmarks – line items in the federal budget directed to local and state projects – while a positive, isn't enough, says Barr. Eliminating earmarks "would make barely a drop in the bucket with regard to the national debt, the deficit," he said after announcing his candidacy at the National Press Club in Washington. As it turns out, Barr's right on the money about how little earmarks have contributed to expanding the national debt. While earmarking has become an easy focal point for fiscal conservatives concerned about the budget deficit, which is now more than $9-trillion in total, having added another $163-billion plus interest in 2007, it's only a small part of the problem. According to an Office of Management and Budget tally, earmarks totaled $17-billion in fiscal 2007, only about 10 percent of the deficit that year. Admittedly, that's after earmarking dropped considerably following the congressional lobbying scandals of 2005 and 2006. But even at their peak in 2005, when earmarks hit $52-billion, according to the Congressional Research Service and the OMB, that was only 16 percent of that year's deficit of $318-billion. Whether Barr's statement is true or not, then, depends on how you define "drop in the bucket." We'd say that Barr's pretty much correct, so we grade his statement Mostly True.

pomt-06014	Says "we’ve accomplished balancing two budgets without raising taxes. We’ve now created 60,000 new private-sector jobs. We’ve made government smaller."	half-true	/new-jersey/statements/2012/jan/17/chris-christie/chris-christie-touts-accomplishments-video-preview/	New Jersey stood at a cliff two years ago. Our obituary was being written, and the state we’d grown up in was slipping away. But then Gov. Chris Christie rescued us. At least that's the version of events that plays out in a video the governor's office released today, about five hours before his annual State of the State address. The video includes a clip from Christie’s Dec. 20 appearance on MSNBC’s Morning Joe, when the governor listed some of his accomplishments. "I have a Legislature that's overwhelmingly Democratic. Yet, we've accomplished balancing two budgets without raising taxes. We've now created 60,000 new private sector jobs. We've made government smaller. We've made it smarter. We've made it less expensive for people." With a backdrop of sunshine breaking through the white clouds, three phrases in red and blue font and all capital letters flash on the screen: "Balanced budgets. Created 60,000 jobs. Made government smaller." 'Balanced Budgets' It’s a claim Christie touts as a fiscal accomplishment: his administration balanced "two budgets without raising taxes." Christie is correct that he balanced two budgets, but the state constitution forbids governors from running budget deficits. Following that requirement, Christie signed two balanced budgets for fiscal years 2011 and 2012. So, that part of Christie’s statement is true. But the governor’s assertion that he didn’t raise taxes is not as clear. We found in a previous PolitiFact New Jersey ruling that although the rates for the state’s three major taxes -- gross income, sales and corporation business -- have not increased during Christie’s tenure, some experts view cuts in state tax credit programs as tax hikes. The state reduced funding for the State Earned Income Tax Credit and programs for property tax relief in fiscal 2011. One expert, Josh Barro, a fellow at the right-leaning Manhattan Institute, told PolitiFact New Jersey in July that a reduction in the earned income tax credit was not a tax hike, because it’s a welfare payment through the tax code. But reducing the property tax credits could be considered tax increases, since they’re meant to offset property tax burdens, he said. In that ruling, the governor’s claim earned a Half True from the Truth-O-Meter. ‘Created 60,000 Jobs’ One of the governor’s frequent talking points is that his administration is responsible for private-sector job growth in New Jersey. PolitiFact New Jersey has checked two previous claims with Christie pointing to jobs gained under his watch. First, let’s address the 60,000 private-sector jobs cited in the video. Based on the latest seasonally adjusted data from the New Jersey Department of Labor and Workforce Development, the video isn’t far off. As of November 2011, there were 3,258,100 private-sector jobs in the Garden State. When compared with January 2010, when Christie was sworn into office, there’s been a gain of 54,700 private-sector jobs. Compared with February 2010 -- Christie’s first full month in office -- there’s been a gain of 62,100 private-sector jobs. But as economic experts have told us for previous rulings, the governor can’t take credit for all of that job growth. Just as we couldn't fully blame Christie for private-sector job losses, we can't fully credit him for private-sector job gains. Each time Christie made a similar claim about private-sector job growth, those statements have landed at Half True on the Truth-O-Meter. ‘Made Government Smaller’ Just as there’s been private-sector job gains, there’s been losses within New Jersey’s public sector. Christie’s claim on Morning Joe that "we’ve made government smaller" followed him saying that there are fewer state workers now than when former Gov. Christine Todd Whitman left office in 2001. We previously found that Christie’s numbers are solid, earning him a True ruling. Compared with January 2001, when Whitman resigned, there are 600 fewer state government employees, marking a minimal decrease of 0.4 percent. Since Christie’s first full month in office, the number of state workers has dropped by 13,100 to 137,800 employees as of November. So, Christie has "made government smaller" by reducing the number of state workers. Our ruling About five hours before he was set to deliver the State of the State address, Christie released a Hollywood-esque trailer touting his accomplishments. As words flash across the screen, Christie is heard listing some of those achievements as "balancing two budgets without raising taxes. We’ve now created 60,000 new private-sector jobs. We’ve made government smaller." We’ve heard all this before from the governor and, once again, his statement needs some serious clarification. Christie has balanced two budgets, but he is required to do so under the state constitution. It’s true that the rates for the state’s three major taxes have not changed under Christie, but the governor has cut funding for some tax credits. The jobs-related claims in the video are on target. The number of state workers has declined during Christie’s tenure, and number of private-sector jobs has grown by about 60,000. But the governor is giving himself too much credit for that job growth. Overall, the three claims don’t give a completely accurate picture of Christie’s New Jersey. We rate the statement Half True. To comment on this ruling, go to NJ.com.

pomt-06296	On auditing the Federal Reserve	half flip	/georgia/statements/2011/nov/18/herman-cain/where-does-cain-stand-auditing-federal-reserve/	Republican presidential candidate and Atlanta-area resident Herman Cain has encountered intense scrutiny in recent weeks for alleged sexual harassment, the viability of his 9-9-9 tax plan and, most recently, his difficulty with a question concerning President Obama’s policies on Libya. But there’s another question that we here at PolitiFact Georgia just couldn’t let go. Some GOP activists and Libertarians say the plain-spoken Cain is not shooting straight on whether he believes the Federal Reserve Bank needs to be regularly audited. The issue has come up in recent months and arose anew during a debate last month. Cain and Texas congressman Ron Paul engaged in some verbal jousting over what Paul said has been a lack of support from Cain on the idea. Cain’s and Paul’s core constituency -- fiscal conservatives and strict constitutionalists -- is the same, and both men appear to be fighting for their support in the crowded field of Republican candidates. Said Paul: "Mr. Cain, in the past, you’ve been rather critical of any of us who would want to audit the Fed." Cain, a former chairman of the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City, said as part of his reply, "[T]o be precise, I do not object to the Federal Reserve being audited. I simply said if someone wants to initiate that option, go right ahead. It doesn’t bother me. So you — I’ve been misrepresented in that regard. I don’t have a problem with the Federal Reserve being audited. It’s simply not my top priority." We wondered if Cain flip-flopped on this issue, as some have claimed. One website, The Liberty Papers, contained a blog post saying Cain "is either a liar or has a very short memory" concerning auditing the Federal Reserve. The site included audio from Cain to argue he’s changed his position. Jason Pye, an Atlanta-area Libertarian activist who knows Cain, wrote a piece claiming the candidate has been dismissive of plans to audit the Federal Reserve. Pye said Cain has been as steady as Jell-O on auditing the Federal Reserve. "Which story are you going to get with a President Cain?" Pye told us. "There’s an inconsistency there." In one video posted by DraftCain2012, the candidate wanted to change the subject with folks who wanted to talk about auditing the Federal Reserve. One man told Cain they can’t audit the Federal Reserve. "We can audit them," Cain replied. Cain told the crowd that they should focus on setting up a meeting with Federal Reserve officials and ask questions about what control measures the bank has in place. He called the Federal Reserve "one of the tightest-run federal entities I have ever seen." Cain is asked specifically in that January meeting if he would ask for an audit of the Federal Reserve if elected president. "But first we need to find out the audits that are already going on," Cain said, raising his arms in exasperation. "What I’m saying is this request for an audit, I’m not sure if that’s the answer to any problem other than people think that they don’t want to be audited." In another YouTube clip, which is on other sites, there is audio of Cain from a guest appearance on "The Neal Boortz Show" discussing all of the audits already in place with the Federal Reserve. "We don’t need to waste money … with another audit that’s unnecessary," Cain said. That YouTube clip also contains video of Cain praising Paul’s efforts to get more information from the Federal Reserve, adding that the congressman "will have the ability to require an audit of the Federal Reserve Bank" as chairman of the House Domestic Monetary Policy and Technology Committee. Paul is currently chairman of that committee. The YouTube clip was posted on May 8, but it does not show when the video of Cain was filmed. Cain tries to set the record straight in his new book, "This Is Herman Cain!: My Journey to the White House," released in September, albeit with some acerbic language directed at Paul and some of his supporters. "[T]hey’ve stretched the truth, saying that I did not want the Federal Reserve to be audited," Cain wrote. "I have never said that. I have said: ‘I don’t’ think you’re going to find anything to audit on the Federal Reserve.’ But they want you to believe that Herman Cain doesn’t want the Federal Reserve to be audited." In general, Cain has said an audit is counterproductive, but he will not object to it. That is largely consistent with his statement at the debate. However, there have been occasions where Cain has been confusing on the topic, like when he appeared to take a more definitive stance, saying on Boortz’s show that "we don’t need to waste money" with an audit. Because of that confusion, we rate his position on auditing the Federal Reserve as a Half Flip.	None	Herman Cain	None	None	None	2011-11-18T06:00:00	2011-10-11	['None']
pomt-10028	"Under the Obama plan . . . all the health care in this country is eventually going to be run by the government."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/mar/05/tom-coburn/obama-health-plan-does-not-include-government-run-/	When Sen. Tom Coburn said that under President Obama, "all the health care in this country is eventually going to be run by the government," it was like a golden oldie PolitiFact has heard many times before. During the campaign, we heard the same tune from vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin , who said Obama was calling for a "government-run plan"; Mitt Romney , who said Obama "wants the government to take over health care"; and Rudy Giuliani , who called Hillary Clinton's similar plan "socialized medicine." (We rated their statements Barely True , Barely True and False .) Coburn, an Oklahoma Republican, made his remarks while criticizing Obama on a different matter. Obama is moving to rescind Bush administration rules that protected medical workers from performing procedures such as abortion that conflicted with their religious or moral beliefs. Coburn, who is against abortion, said rescinding the order would be only a first step for the Obama administration. "Remember, under the Obama plan . . . all the health care in this country is eventually going to be run by the government," Coburn said in an interview on Fox News on March 4, 2009. "So it's part of an incremental creep towards eliminating any objection, both as us as taxpayers and then individual physicians in terms of not complying with a government-run bureaucracy," he added. Coburn and Obama can fairly disagree about conscience protections for health care workers who oppose abortions. But he's wrong that Obama's plan offers government-run health care. In fact, Obama's plan leaves in place the private health care system, but seeks to expand it to the uninsured. It increases eligibility for the poor and children to enroll in initiatives like Medicaid and the State Children’s Health Insurance Program, and creates pools for individuals to buy their own cheaper insurance. It also outlines strategies to rein in costs for everyone, such as electronic medical records and preventive care. "I think most of us would agree that if we want to cover all Americans, we can't make the mistake of trying to fix what isn't broken," Obama said at a health care conference he hosted on March 5. "So if somebody has insurance they like, they should be able to keep that insurance. If they have a doctor that they like, they should be able to keep their doctor. They should just pay less for the care that they receive." Would Obama's plan result in closer regulation of the health care system? Very likely so. It includes provisions that require health insurance companies to cover pre-existing conditions and disclose more information about how they treat patients. Obama's plan also calls for evidence-based health care standards, so that government can stop paying (through programs like Medicare) for treatments that don't get good results. But the plan is very different from some European-style health systems where the government owns health clinics and employs doctors. We asked Coburn's office about his remarks. "What matters is not just President Obama’s intent, or what his plan states, but the likely effect and consequences of his plan," said spokesman John Hart. "Under Obama’s approach, the only plans left standing will be those controlled by the government." That may be Sen. Coburn's opinion on what could happen, but it's definitely not part of Obama's plan. And Coburn was very specific in saying that "under the Obama plan, all the health care in this country is eventually going to be run by the government." That gives the incorrect impression that Obama is promoting a government-run health care system. He's not. We rate Coburn's statement False.

pomt-03173	Says there's a "100-year-old international norm not to use chemical weapons."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2013/sep/05/debbie-wasserman-schultz/rep-debbie-wasserman-schultz-says-theres-100-year-/	What’s so special about chemical weapons? As President Barack Obama appeals to Congress to authorize a limited military strike against Syria, he has focused on intelligence that the country killed its own citizens in a chemical attack. Yet far more Syrians have died in the nation’s two-year-old civil war in other ways. What’s the difference? U.S. officials and lawmakers explain that there’s long-standing international agreement that chemical warfare simply isn’t okay. Democratic National Committee chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz, for example, recently described a "100-year-old international norm not to use chemical weapons." Have the world’s nations opposed such weapons since the early 1900s? Taboo since before they were fully developed Wasserman Schultz, a South Florida congresswoman, explained the president’s position in an interview Sept. 2, 2013, with CNN’s Wolf Blitzer. He asked her why Obama sought congressional support to punish the Syrians when previous presidents had acted without lawmakers in Grenada, Panama, Somalia, Iraq, Yugoslavia and Libya. "Why do you believe it’s necessary now?" he asked. "Well, let's be clear," she said. "The president … does not believe that he is required to seek Congress' authorization." Instead, she said, congressional authorization for a targeted strike would help Syrian leader Bashar Assad understand that "his violation of a 100-year-old international norm not to use chemical weapons against either your own people or as a legitimate weapon of war will have a certain and severe response. And that he has to be held accountable for atrocities like that." A hundred years ago, the world had yet to face the horrors of World War I, when nearly 100,000 people were killed by grenades and artillery shells loaded with chemicals like chlorine and mustard gas. Nor had they experienced the million casualties that followed from chemical attacks worldwide. Yet, it turns out, some international agreement against gas attacks predated the war — and even full development of the weapons themselves. An early ban Wasserman Schultz’s office sent us a declaration from world powers at an International Peace Conference at The Hague — dated 1899. It banned projectiles designed to spread "asphyxiating or deleterious gases." It was binding only among signing countries in the case of a war between two of them, and didn’t apply if a non-signing country jumped into the battle. It was worded as a limited agreement, not a moral condemnation. It came before general use of the weapons themselves. It was signed by more than two dozen countries, and ratified by all the major powers — except the United States. The American representative to the conference didn't agree to the declaration partly because he thought gas warfare, which had not yet been fully developed, was just as humane as other warfare, according to instructions to the American delegates and their official reports. But the Hague Declaration marked the start of international consensus on the topic, says Richard Price, a political scientist at the University of British Columbia who wrote a book called The Chemical Weapons Taboo. "I think it's fair to say 'international norm' at that point," Price told PolitiFact. World War I was the first major test. Nations flunked. Fierce debate broke out over the reach of the ban, Price said, which restricted only projectiles, not all chemical warfare. Countries pointed fingers as thousands died in brutal chemical attacks in which victims choked and burned. Peace treaties, then the 1925 Geneva Conference, went much further than the Hague Declaration. World leaders in Geneva noted that "the use in war of asphyxiating, poisonous or other gases, and of all analogous liquids, materials or devices, has been justly condemned by the general opinion of the civilized world." They wrote that prohibition of such weapons would be "universally accepted as part of international law" and appealed to the "conscience" of nations. The Geneva Protocol has since been ratified by 137 states, according to a white paper from the White House Office of Legislative Affairs provided by Wasserman Schultz’s office. But the United States, which pushed for the Geneva Protocol, didn't ratify it until 1975. Since then, chemical attacks have been rare, with just a few notable exceptions — such as Iraq’s use of them in the 1980s against Iran. Those attacks, it turned out, took place with American support. Syria, by the way, was among countries in agreement against chemical weapons, ratifying the Geneva Protocol in 1968. But Syria has been less cooperative since then, as one of the only holdouts to 1992’s Chemical Weapons Convention. (The United States actually ratified that one.) That agreement to entirely eliminate chemical weapons "for the sake of all mankind" includes 189 nations that represent about 98 percent of the world’s population, according to the United Nations. It may not be binding law for Syria, but it certainly represents an international norm, Price says. Our ruling Wasserman Schultz mentioned on CNN a "100-year-old international norm not to use chemical weapons." An international peace conference at The Hague before World War I did take up the use of chemical weapons, limiting their use between world powers more than 100 years ago. But disagreement about whether their use was humane led the American representative to hold out. Backlash after atrocities during World War I led to even broader international condemnation in 1925, nearly 90 years ago. Yet there weren't votes in the U.S. Senate to ratify that agreement until the 1970s. Now most of the world agrees such weapons ought to be eliminated entirely. But it was a long slog to get there. World powers did reach some international agreement against chemical weapons more than 100 years ago, though the context requires some clarification. We rate Wasserman Schultz’s claim Mostly True. CLARIFICATION: This article was updated to reflect that though gas projectiles hadn't been fully developed for practical use at the time of the Hague Declaration, some use of chemicals as weapons predated the 1899 agreement. Also, Syria didn't ratify the Geneva Protocol until 1968.	None	Debbie Wasserman Schultz	None	None	None	2013-09-05T11:26:36	2013-09-02	['None']
pomt-04570	Says Obama sent $450 million to China to build a wind farm in Texas.	pants on fire!	/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/sep/25/americans-tax-reform/anti-tax-group-says-obama-sent-450-million-china-b/	In the battleground state of Florida, critics of President Obama have accused him not simply of spending billions in stimulus money to no good effect but actually using that money to give a leg up to America’s economic rivals. Americans for Tax Reform has revived an old charge that Obama sent $450 million to create jobs in China. Americans for Tax Reform -- an anti-tax group whose founder, Grover Norquist, is famous for arguing for a government so small it could be drowned in a bathtub -- mailed a flyer to Florida voters that showed a stack of hundred dollar bills being blown in a graceful arc across the globe to land in a very red China. On the reverse side, it said "Obama's massive spending includes giving millions to a Chinese company to build a wind farm in Texas. The Chinese company is expected to receive $450 million in U.S. taxpayer money. More jobs in China .. fewer jobs here." We’ve looked at this sort of claim before and in this fact check, we examine whether Obama sent $450 million to China to build a wind farm in Texas. Promoting alternative energy under the stimulus Americans for Tax Reform told us it based this claim on an ABC News report from 2010. In that story, ABC pointed out that the bulk of the stimulus dollars spent on wind and solar projects went to foreign companies. With the twin goals of diversifying the country’s energy supply and boosting a domestic alternative energy industry, the Obama administration used the stimulus to expand a program that awarded tax credits for wind and solar projects once they came online and produced power. The tax credits were handed out as grants that could cover up to 30 percent of the construction costs. We checked on the latest numbers and found that as of 2011, some $9.8 billion went to fund over 300 wind farms around the country. The ABC report relied heavily on the work of Russ Choma, who at the time was a journalist with the Investigative Reporting Workshop, a project at American University. Choma noted that foreign companies received over 60 percent of the alternative energy grants. As we’ll explain in a moment, that does not tell us how much of that money went overseas. Right now, our main focus is that wind farm in Texas built with Chinese towers and turbines. The ABC report spoke of it this way, "Perhaps the most controversial wind project is one that has yet to receive stimulus money." It then goes on to say that a reporter visited the vacant offices of the Chinese firm that allegedly was providing the turbines. So Americans for Tax Reform relied on an article that said the project had not been funded and gave some evidence that hinted strongly that the project was not very active. In fact, by late 2010, it was clear that this particular Texas wind farm had never gone beyond the idea stage. In 2012, Liz Salerno, director of industry data and analysis for the trade group American Wind Energy Association, confirmed that. Salerno tracks wind projects across the country. "The companies held a press conference at the National Press Club in 2010," Salerno said. "They have made no progress since that announcement." PolitiFact Ohio wrote a piece making the same point in 2012. Let’s return briefly to the question of whether stimulus dollars have benefited foreign companies. The short answer is, yes but how much is unclear. Choma, the investigative reporter, noted that the larger overseas firms have American plants that make the blades and other components that were used in U.S. wind farms. Choma wrote that tracking the dollars would be a massive undertaking. "I can't say how many of the turbines built by American manufacturers were overseas, and how many of the turbines built by foreign manufacturers were built here," Choma said. To choose just one example, a wind farm in Alaska has a distinct multi-national flavor. The turbines come from GE, the blades from Brazil, the generators come from Southern California, the central hubs from the Florida Panhandle and the towers from China. The National Renewable Energy Laboratory reported that the grant program added between 44,000 to 66,000 jobs in the wind energy sector each year from 2009 to 2011. Employment peaked in 2009 when new construction was at its height. It has since fallen and the wind power industry is poised for further declines if government tax credits are not renewed beyond 2013. Our ruling The Americans for Tax Reform flyer said that Obama sent $450 million to China to build a wind farm in Texas. The wind farm was never built, the project sponsors never applied for government funds and never received any. These facts have been well known for at least two years and were publicly reported several times. The source cited by Americans for Tax Reform noted that the project had not been funded. The flyer spreads a discredited claim. We rate the statement Pants on Fire.	None	Americans For Tax Reform	None	None	None	2012-09-25T17:02:33	2012-09-21	['China', 'Texas']

pomt-02210	Liberals have figured out a Facebook algorithm and "all the people getting banned from Facebook are somehow conservatives."	false	/punditfact/statements/2014/apr/22/todd-starnes/radio-host-only-conservatives-get-banned-facebook/	It seems like plenty of conservatives have a love-hate relationship with Facebook. They love to leverage its power and rack up big numbers when a post goes viral. But they hate it when Facebook yanks something they’ve put up. Conservative radio talk show host Todd Starnes thought he had grounds for complaint. He had quipped on his Facebook page that the owner of cattle that were grazing on federal land without a permit should have claimed they were Mexican cows seeking a better life. Facebook removed the post. On Fox News’ Hannity, Starnes blamed liberals. "Liberals just don't have a sense of humor," Starnes said. "Not the first time they have come after me for something I wrote on Facebook. And a lot of people think it's Facebook removing conservative posts, but they tell us that it’s an algorithm that the liberals have somehow figured out and coincidentally all the people getting banned from Facebook are somehow conservatives." There are two elements here to check. Is there an algorithm that liberals, or anyone, could exploit to bring down messages they don’t agree with? And are all the people getting banned from Facebook conservatives? We reached out to Starnes for supporting details and didn’t hear back. According to the press office at Facebook, there is no algorithm. The mega-social media site has community standards (Facebook says it does not tolerate bullying, hate speech and pornography, for examples) and readers can report posts that they think violate the rules. But a statement on the site says reports alone won’t bring a post down. "The number of times something is reported doesn't determine whether or not it's removed from Facebook," the statement says. A person, not an algorithm, decides the fate of a post. "When a person reports something to Facebook, we review whether it violates our Community Standards," Facebook spokesman Matt Steinfeld told PunditFact. "Abusive content directed at private individuals and attacks on people based on their race, ethnicity or national origin will be removed when reported to us." It is the abusive content, not the politics or ideology behind it, that lead to a post coming down. We were assured that the number of reports have no effect on the likelihood that a post will be reviewed. So then there’s the question of whether only conservatives suffer at the hands of this system. Starnes isn’t the first person to make a claim like this. At least one conservative website, facebookcensorship.com, has been set up for people to report when they feel they’ve been unfairly treated. A website affiliated with the conservative Weekly Standard, Examiner.com, reported that several conservative groups and bloggers found themselves temporarily banned by Facebook. The Examiner linked this to an anti-spam feature that spotted people who posted to different pages too quickly. Accurate or not, the instances don’t prove that Facebook only targets conservatives. The issue is: Do liberals make the same complaints? They do. In 2011, a liberal blogger wrote "liberal page administrators and bloggers in my network started spreading the word that they had been blocked from posting ANY content on ANY other wall for 15 days. No prior warning was given." In 2012, a group called "Being Liberal" complained about being kicked off Facebook. "I believe that there is right now an 'army' of paid trolls working for the conservative black PR macjine (sic) that is reporting our content," a poster wrote. A blog out of the Harvard Law School warned that the Facebook reviews inevitably will be subjective because they are done by human beings. One reporter who spent time at Facebook found that reviewers aim to make a decision within half a second. That wouldn’t leave much time for a careful assessment. There have been cases where Facebook has admitted that it made a mistake. Our ruling Starnes said all the people getting banned from Facebook are conservatives and that liberals had figured out a way to game the system. We could find no tally of conservative versus liberal complaints about troubles with Facebook. Starnes said all the people getting banned were conservatives and that is not the case. As for the algorithm, Facebook says there isn’t one. Users report violations and staff at Facebook review those reports. We rate this claim False. Update: We've updated this fact-check with an additional example of a liberal group complaining of being blocked on Facebook after a reader noted that one our previous examples likely came from a satirical conservative group.

pomt-05347	Says Jeff Reardon cut elementary school music classes, art instruction, teaching positions, basketball and volleyball programs, and he voted to raise school lunch prices.	mostly false	/oregon/statements/2012/may/11/mike-schaufler/did-jeff-reardon-cut-school-programs-and-vote-rais/	In defending his House District 48 seat in the primary election, Rep. Mike Schaufler, D-Portland, paints challenger Jeff Reardon as a big honking disappointment to schools. (Actually, this accusation cuts both ways.) A Schaufler campaign mailer features a forlorn-looking girl on one side. On the other, there’s an apple sliced with all the different ways Reardon, a David Douglas High School teacher and former school board member, has failed that girl and other students. Specifically, Reardon "cut elementary school music classes... cut art instruction … cut teaching positions … cut basketball and volleyball programs." He "even voted to raise school lunch prices." Truly, he must be a dreadful person opposed to the children. We had to know more. Reardon served on the David Douglas School Board from October 1987 to 1998, and as chair for the 1993-94 and 1996-97 fiscal school years. Hiram Sachs, a Schaufler consultant, said in an email that all of the claims stemmed from news stories published in The Oregonian and school board minutes, in the years 1988 and 1993. In February 1988, the David Douglas schools superintendent proposed a $25.4 million budget for the 1988-89 school year, according to a news story in The Oregonian. The proposed budget eliminated eight teaching positions. Board minutes show that Reardon, as a member of seven-member board, approved the budget. (The Oregonian news story also noted that the superintendent said the reduction shouldn’t raise the student-to-teacher ratio.) Let’s go to the next claim, that Reardon cut extracurriculars, including music, art, basketball and volleyball. Again, as a member of the board, Reardon voted to scale back athletics and extracurricular programs in the 1993-94 school year. (The following year some of those cuts were restored due to an increase in the budget, according to a 1994 news story in The Oregonian.) And finally, the claim about raising the price of school breakfasts and lunches. True! He did, in May 1993. Children had to pay 10 cents more for each meal. "If there were cuts, I can tell you they were done with the greatest agony. Any cuts of that nature would have been done as a last resort," said Reardon, who had trouble remembering details of the votes. Sachs, Schaufler’s consultant, said of course Reardon had choices. He could have pushed for administrative or other savings that would not have hurt children. "This is his voting record; this is the basis of his candidacy," Sachs said. Reardon, as a member of a school board, is absolutely responsible for every decision made by the board. We have no quibble with that, and wouldn’t suggest otherwise. But the mailer states that "Jeff Reardon’s cuts devastated our schools and shortchanged our kids." Reardon did not personally or single-handedly deprive children of teachers, art classes or basketball programs. We also think the mailer is misleading because it cherrypicks two budget votes and one school meal vote out of the more than 10 years Reardon served on the school board. For example, as we noted above, the school district was able "to hire 11 more teachers, restore cuts made in athletics last year and begin education reforms" in 1994-95 thanks to a $2.7 million budget increase. Budgets go up and they go down. If "Reardon’s cuts" shortchanged children, then most anyone who’s ever served on a school board probably is guilty of the same crime. As are legislators who approve K-12 budgets that result in program cuts. A decision to approve a budget -- or a bill -- that results in larger classrooms, fewer teachers, or more expensive lunches does not mean that that person supports those results. Schaufler’s mailer contains a nugget of truth but is woefully misleading. We rate it Mostly False.	None	Mike Schaufler	None	None	None	2012-05-11T17:42:46	2012-05-08	['None']

pomt-03411	Says "the mandate is 71 times that a child’s body will be injected with a disease" for immunizations.	false	/oregon/statements/2013/jun/29/jason-conger/are-oregon-children-subjected-71-immunization-shot/	The Oregon Legislature just made it harder for parents to exempt children from vaccinations required for school. This does not sit well with people -- including some lawmakers -- who say parents know best when or if their children should receive shots to protect them from whooping cough and measles. Rep. Jason Conger, R-Bend, voted no on Senate Bill 132. He spoke on the floor about the number of mandatory shots a child must receive in the course of his or her time in school: 71 times. "So there’s 17 at preschool, child care or Head Start enrollment. There are 19 at K through 5 grade, there are 17 in 6th grade and there are 18 in high school, well, 7th grade through high school," he said. "That’s not the number of immunizations, that’s the number of actual shots." He went on to say: "Understand that the mandate is 71 times that a child’s body will be injected with a disease. It is not, clearly, something we should take lightly when balancing the parent’s opinion about what is good for the child and the fact that the mandate is for 71 injections into their child’s body." Yeah, we did a double take, too, when we heard that. Three score and 11 shots? We wanted to know if this was true. It turns out that in citing this fantastic number Conger relied on a fact sheet, detailing which immunizations are required for the 2013-14 school year, based on the student’s grade. Unfortunately for Conger, this is the same fact sheet relied on by a spokeswoman for the Oregon Health Authority, in showing why the representative’s statement is not accurate. The sheet lists the immunizations needed for a child 18 months or older entering preschool, child care or Head Start. The child would need four doses for diphtheria, tetanus and pertussis; three doses for polio; one for chickenpox; one for measles, mumps, rubella; three doses for Hepatitis B; two doses for Hepatitis A; and three or four doses against Hib disease. We count at most 18 shots. Now, when the student enters kindergarten, or any grades 1 through 5, the child needs another immunization shot against diphtheria, tetanus and pertussis; one more shot against polio; and one more shot against the measles. We count 21 shots total. Because, you see, the categories of immunization shots are cumulative. It’s not that the child has to receive three shots to ward off Hepatitis B in preschool, and then again in kindergarten. Let’s continue. There are no new shots needed for the vaccinated child who enters grade 6. A student entering grades 7 to 12 needs to get one booster shot against tetanus, diphtheria and pertussis. We count 22 vaccination shots, at most. These vaccinations apply to children in public school and private schools, Head Start, preschools and certified child care programs. Home-schooled students are subject to immunization requirements in certain situations. Separately, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends that children receive two influenza shots in the first year and a shot once a year, thereafter, wrote Susan Wickstrom, a spokeswoman with the Oregon Health Authority. There are also vaccines for pneumococcal, meningococcal conjugate, and HPV. "But even with annual flu shots, the total of immunization injections that a child receives before high school graduation would be less than 71," Wickstrom wrote to PolitiFact Oregon. She said it for us: Nowhere near 71 shots. The state requirements total, at most, 22 shots, including the Hib shots. We caught up with Conger and asked him to confirm our understanding. He did and immediately owned up to his mistake. He said he just counted up the number of shots before making his floor speech. "I was wrong about that," Conger said. "I certainly wasn’t trying to distort the truth. But I was wrong about that." Conger said his larger point remains: Government should be careful when curbing parental rights, he said. "In my view, the debate around SB 132 was about the need for legislative restraint and deference to parents generally in decisions about the welfare of their children." We rate the statement False.

pomt-09704	Health care reform "establishes a new board of federal bureaucrats (the 'Health Benefits Advisory Committee') to dictate the health plans that all individuals must purchase."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/nov/04/house-republicans/health-benefits-advisory-committee-what-plan-buy/	A few months ago, a chain e-mail purporting to be a line-by-line analysis of the House health care reform bill reached in-boxes all over the country, warning people of the dire consequences of the Democratic plans for reform. Taking a page from the same playbook, the House Republican Conference has created a similar list for the new health care bill that will be coming to the House floor in the next few weeks. You can read our fact-check of the Republican analysis in its entirety. Here, we're looking only at the statement, "Page 111 - Section 223 establishes a new board of federal bureaucrats (the 'Health Benefits Advisory Committee') to dictate the health plans that all individuals must purchase." Under the Democrats' health care reform plan, people will have to buy health insurance or pay a tax penalty, and policymakers have said they want everyone covered. The House bill also says what basic coverage should include: hospitalizations, physicians' visits, prescription drugs, mental health and substance abuse treatment, preventive care, maternity care, well-baby and well-child care, and durable medical equipment. But it doesn't provide specifics, like what kinds of prescription drugs or specific medical procedures must be covered. The bill creates the Health Benefits Advisory Committee to advise the secretary of Health and Human Services on what the specifics should be. The committee will have up to 27 members appointed by the president and the Comptroller General, and it will represent the major stakeholders in the health care system, according to the bill. The committee doesn't dictate health plans, though: It advises the secretary, who can reject the recommendations. Another important caveat is that the committee helps set a baseline for different types of coverage. People are then free to select any health plan they like that meets or exceeds the basic requirements. So the committee does not dictate which health plans all individuals must purchase. We find the House Republican Conference's statement, "Page 111 - Section 223 establishes a new board of federal bureaucrats (the 'Health Benefits Advisory Committee') to dictate the health plans that all individuals must purchase," makes it sound as if bureaucrats tell you which plan you have to buy. In reality, the committee advises the secretary of Health and Human Services on what baseline coverage should include. We rate the statement False.

pomt-02279	"The numbers of people that support Obamacare and like it have been steadily dropping."	false	/punditfact/statements/2014/apr/06/liz-cheney/liz-cheney-people-support-obamacare-have-been-stea/	Conservative pundits often incorporate polling data into their arguments against the Affordable Care Act, and it’s no wonder: Polls usually reveal that a plurality find the law unpopular. But a claim by Liz Cheney, the former conservative Wyoming Senate candidate and daughter of former Vice President Dick Cheney, shows how polling trends can be easily flubbed on TV. As part of a political roundtable on Fox News Sunday on April 6, Cheney tried knocking down Democratic cheering about news from the White House that 7 million people signed up for Obamacare. The real story? The law is losing support, she said. "The numbers of people that support Obamacare and like it have been steadily dropping," she said. "The latest Wall Street Journal polls show that." PunditFact wanted to know if Cheney’s point is accurate. We didn’t hear back from her after reaching out on Twitter. Polls run aplenty, and the health care law is a frequently surveyed topic. We already know from PolitiFact that a sizable share of Americans want the health care law repealed, but they do not increasingly want it repealed. We wanted to look at the evolving support and opposition for the health care law, and not just from the Wall Street Journal. Sites like Huffington Post Pollster and Real Clear Politics offer averages of several polls to give readers an idea of the public’s changing views of the law since its infancy. It’s not a perfect way of looking at the data, as the survey questions are not identical and the polls vary in size. Still, the polling aggregators don’t show steadily falling approval ratings for the law. According to a Real Clear Politics average of nine major polls from March 16-31, 40.4 percent of Americans favor the law and 52 percent do not. This is less than 2 percentage points shy of the favorability mark for much of March a year ago, and down a bit from a recent high of 42.6 percent at the end of October (the highest average on Real Clear Politics was 43 percent in June 2010). As problems with the online insurance marketplaces mounted last fall, approval for the law fell, hitting 36.9 percent in December. Approval ratings since have spurted up and down to their most recent place. See the chart. HuffPost’s Pollster shows a similar trend in its aggregration. The most recent average for people who favor the health care law is 41.2 percent, down from 42.1 percent in October but up from 38.1 percent in December. After the health care law passed in March 2010, poll averages hovered between 40 and 43 percent for the rest of the year before falling off a bit. Obama’s re-election gave the favorability ratings another boost during the end of 2012, peaking at 43.4 percent. Polls on the health care law have been pretty consistent, said Karlyn Bowman, senior fellow at the conservative American Enterprise Institute. She pointed to AEI’s March 2014 study of health care polling by nine major pollsters since 2009. Shifts in support for the law have not been one of the bigger storylines because it has not changed that dramatically, she said. People usually chew on President Barack Obama’s favorability ratings or how he is handling the law’s implementation. Not even the poll Cheney singled out provides persuasive evidence for her claim that supporters have been turning against the law. The latest Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll was a March 5-9 survey of 1,000 adults with a margin of error of 3.1 percentage points. The poll asked, "From what you have heard about the new health care law, do you think it is a good idea or a bad idea?" and then "do you feel that way strongly, or not so strongly?" In March 2014, 35 percent said it was a good idea, and 49 percent said it was bad. Digging a little deeper, 26 percent of people said they strongly thought it was a good idea, trailing the 42 percent of respondents who felt strongly that it’s a bad idea. Previous NBC/WSJ surveys, of which there were eight since June 2013, don’t show a recent favorability freefall. "It is clearly more unpopular than popular, but negativity isn't growing in this poll," Bowman said. In fact, a new poll from ABC News and the Washington Post has Democrats hoping they’re flipping the Obamacare narrative. For the first time in at least 20 ABC/Post polls since August 2009, more people said they supported the law than opposed it, with support hitting a high of 49 percent. The 49 percent-48 percent margin could mean divisions are closer to a dead heat in the months after botched healthcare.gov rollout. Support was 40 percent and opposition was 57 percent in a November 2013 ABC/Post poll. Whether it’s an outlier or a new direction remains to be seen. "It could be that the tide is turning," Bowman said. "We just don’t know." Our ruling Cheney said, "The numbers of people that support Obamacare and like it have been steadily dropping." Americans remain divided on the health care law, and most polls show that more people oppose it than support it. But we found no evidence that people who once supported the law are "steadily" changing their minds -- not even in the poll Cheney specifically cited. We rate Cheney’s claim False.

pomt-11779	Among states, Missouri ranks "3rd (in) average yearly growth of high-tech industries."	mostly true	/missouri/statements/2017/nov/27/missouri-department-economic-development/missouris-growth-high-tech-industries-mostly-line-/	In efforts to lure Amazon to the Midwest, Missouri officials sent three proposals to the tech-giant by Oct. 19 to be considered for the location of its second headquarters. Kansas City and St. Louis officials threw their hats into the ring, and state officials proposed an innovation corridor along I-70, which would link the two metro areas. Missouri’s brochure released on the MakeMOHQ2Home website claims the state ranked third in "average yearly growth of high-tech industries." When you think of a "high-tech" state, California and New York may be the first states to come to mind, but not Missouri. We wanted to find out how high-tech Missouri really is, and how it ranks in the country. We spoke with the researchers behind the data and economic experts who all agreed that rate of growth can be misleading. What’s a high-tech industry? The Bureau of Labor Statistics notes that defining high-tech is a moving target. Generally, though, it considers jobs with lots of workers in science, technology, engineering and math fields to be part of the high-tech industry. Missouri officials used a 2016 Milken Institute study in their claim. The Milken Institute is a nonprofit and nonpartisan think tank. The Milken Institute has a "free-market slant," said Michael Leeds, chair of the economics department at Temple University, "but (is) a credible group of scholars." Minoli Ratnatunga, director of regional economics research at the institute’s Center for Regional Economics, was a researcher in the study. Ratnatunga said the group considered 19 industries it thought were high-tech. A few of these industries include: pharmaceutical and medicine manufacturing, commercial and service industry machinery manufacturing, medical equipment and supplies manufacturing, telecommunications and computer systems design. Missouri’s ranking The Milken Institute’s 2016 State Technology and Science Indexshows that Missouri ranked third in average yearly growth of high-tech industries from 2010 to 2015. However, this is just one component that makes up Missouri’s overall placement. In 2016, Missouri ranked 28 out of 50. Two years prior, Missouri ranked 34 out of 50. In 2012, Missouri ranked 29 out of 50. These scores are based on several factors: human capital investment, research and development, risk capital, technology and science workforce, and technology concentration. Massachusetts, Colorado and Maryland were ranked the top three states overall in 2016. Kansas, Tennessee and Oklahoma ranked behind Missouri, with West Virginia rated last. "That tells us where Missouri ranks relative to its peers," Ratnatunga said. "It’s improving, and things like (high-tech) growth is one aspect that’s impacted its overall ranking, but it’s not in the top tier." Ratnatunga said it’s easy for Missouri’s high-tech industry to look as if it’s grown exponentially. "If you have a relatively small sector, it’s easier to get a higher growth rate," Ratnatunga said. "The same 500 jobs added in California would be a smaller growth rate." Leeds also said the rate of growth can be deceiving. "If you have a very small base, twice a very small number is 100 percent growth, but it can be a very small number," he said. Ratnatunga said companies like Amazon need to look at the index overall when considering a state’s economy. This means recognizing qualities like overall growth in the economy, the quality of the workforce, universities, capital investments and research and development inputs. "If it doesn’t meet Amazon’s requirements, it might be a great choice for other companies that are looking to grow in high-tech," Ratnatunga said. Our ruling Missouri officials claimed Missouri ranked "3rd (in) average yearly growth of high-tech industries." While Missouri high-tech industries may have seen growth, the size of base matters. Missouri has seen a growth in high-tech jobs, but the claim can be misleading when you don’t consider the size of the base. Overall, Missouri is about average in the rankings. We rate this Mostly True.	None	Missouri Department of Economic Development	None	None	None	2017-11-27T17:33:03	2017-10-19	['Missouri']
pomt-08926	"Jane Norton supported the largest tax hike in Colorado history."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/jul/26/americans-job-security/jane-norton-supported-referendum-c-so-did-voters/	It's not everyday a candidate personally appears in an ad to call her opponent gutless, but that's what Jane Norton did in the Republican primary for U.S. Senate in Colorado. "Seen those TV ads attacking me? They're paid for by a shady interest group doing the bidding of Ken Buck," she said in reaction to the ad paid for by Americans for Job Security. "You'd think Ken would be man enough to do it himself," Norton says in her own ad. "Here's the truth: In state government, I cut budgets, cut programs and reduced staff," Norton continues. "Ken Buck's Office? His spending skyrocketed by 40 percent. We need a senator who's actually cut spending, and has the backbone to stand her ground." The "shady interest group" Norton refers to is an outfit called Americans for Job Security. What they had to say about her wasn't so nice, either. "Our country is at the brink," a narrator says. "Colorado families and workers need relief -- yet Jane Norton supported the largest tax hike in Colorado history, costing us billions. And Jane Norton's record on government spending? The state bureaucracy she managed grew by $43 million in just three years. Record taxes and reckless spending has cost Colorado jobs. Call Jane Norton, tell her no more tax hikes and big government spending." Norton is a former lieutenant governor who got early backing from Republican Party leaders. Buck, on the other hand, is the Weld County District Attorney and a former U.S. attorney and has received backing from the tea party movement. There are a lot of facts to sort through here. In this check, we're going to look at the tax increase charge against Norton. We'll examine Americans for Job Security's claim about an increasing bureaucracy in another report, and Norton's charges against Buck in still another report. Americans for Job Security isn't a typical political action committee. It's organized as a business league 501(c)(6), which means its ads are limited to issue advocacy and that the group isn't required to publicly disclose its donors. The group's website says it favors "free markets and pro-paycheck public policy," and it has a reputation for working against unions. Still, it was fairly easy for us to reach the president of Americans for Job Security, Stephen DeMaura and ask him about the group's claims, specifically that Norton "supported the largest tax hike in Colorado history, costing us billions." He said the group has not coordinated with Buck and that Norton should address the ad's substance. "Rather than wasting time with empty attack ads, she should respond to the claims and discuss them," DeMaura said. What Americans for Job Security calls the "largest tax hike in Colorado history" is actually subject to debate; some people contend it wasn't a tax increase at all. Let's start with a brief primer on Colorado tax history. Our story begins in 1992, when Colorado voters approved a Taxpayer's Bill of Rights, popularly known as TABOR. The measure said the government can't spend tax money collected under existing tax rates if revenues grow faster than inflation and population. Instead, the government had to rebate that money to taxpayers. These rebates applied to many types of taxes and business fees, but it primarily affected income and sales taxes. TABOR also required any tax increases to be approved by voters. By 2005, the Taxpayer's Bill of Rights had curtailed government spending to the point that some people felt basic services were being hurt, particularly for education. So voters were asked to approve Referendum C, allowing government to stop refunding excess revenues for the next five years. The measure drew bipartisan support from Colorado's elected leaders, including then Gov. Bill Owens, a Republican, as well as his lieutenant governor -- Jane Norton. Anti-tax groups vehemently opposed the measure, saying it was a betrayal of TABOR. But voters approved Referendum C with 52 percent of the vote. Norton explained her support for the referendum in March 2010 to Fox 31 KDVR of Denver. "Referendum C is actually the Taxpayers Bill of Rights in action," Norton said. "TABOR allows for people to vote. And in this case, it was: do you want your tax refund to go -- it was a five-year time out -- and 52 percent of the people said yes, we will forgo our tax refund to help pay for essential services." Her campaign also told Denver's ABC 7NEWS that the referendum was "an unfortunate consequence of the worst recession in state history. Passing it meant the state did not have to close colleges, let prisoners out early, or cut services to the elderly." For our fact-check, we also wanted to determine whether Referendum C was actually the "largest" increase in tax revenues in Colorado history. We wondered, for example, if Referendum C was proportionally larger than Colorado's adoption of a 4 percent income tax in 1937. We looked, but we couldn't find any analysis comparing the two measures. Natalie Mullis, chief economist for Colorado Legislative Council staff, which provides policy analysis for the Colorado Assembly, said she's gotten the same question from Colorado officials, but no definitive answer exists. She did say that Referendum C was the only significant increase in tax revenues since 1992, when TABOR passed. The Americans for Job Security ad says in a graphic that Referendum C raised $6 billion. We asked Mullis about this; she said that the number was likely based on projections before the economic downturn started in 2008. The measure has actually generated about $3.7 billion, all of that in the three years right after the bill was passed. There were no extra revenues generated for 2009 and 2010, she said, due to the economic downturn. Americans for Job Security said that "Jane Norton supported the largest tax hike in Colorado history." If the issue is just Referendum C, then yes, Norton supported it. But there are a number of qualifiers to that "yes": The evidence is not conclusive that it's the largest tax increase in Colorado history, though certainly it's the largest in recent years. Also, technically speaking, the measure didn't increase tax rates -- it ended rebates, though that does mean less money in people's pockets. Finally, Norton supported a ballot issue on which Colorado voters had the final say and ultimately approved. Given these facts, we rate this statement Half True.

pomt-14967	On support for the Export-Import Bank	full flop	/wisconsin/statements/2015/oct/20/ron-johnson/ron-johnson-export-import-bank/	When General Electric announced plans to cut hundreds of jobs in Waukesha, company executives blamed Congress for failing to renew an obscure federal agency, the Export-Import Bank. Led by a group of conservatives, the House of Representatives over the summer of 2015 efused to reauthorize funding for the bank, which helps U.S. companies sell their goods and services in foreign countries by providing financing for export deals. Those opposed to the bank say it amounts to corporate welfare, while GE officials and other business leaders say it helps the playing field for U.S. companies competing in the global marketplace. Balancing those business interests with a desire for a smaller federal government can create some political complications -- including for U.S. Sen. Ron Johnson, the Wisconsin Republican. Johnson defeated Democratic U.S. Sen. Russ Feingold in 2010 with support of the tea party conservatives who strongly oppose the bank. He faces a tough rematch against Feingold in 2016. In 2012, not long after he took office, Johnson, voted against reauthorization of what is often termed the "Ex-Im Bank." Three years later, he had a different take on the organization. Time to to our Flip-O-Meter, which examines whether a politician has changed position on an issue. Our requisite reminder: It does not measure whether any change is good or bad policy or politics, only whether the candidate has been consistent. The Wisconsin picture The bank has been in the news in Wisconsin thanks to the Sept. 28, 2015 announcement by GE that it would cut 350 jobs at its Waukesha operation, which makes engines for the oil and gas industry. The company said it would build a new factory and move the work to Canada because that country has an export credit agency. By that time, Johnson had already voted to support its reauthorization. In the wake of the GE news, Johnson told the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel that he had heard from companies that benefitted from the bank and call it an important tool to help them do business overseas. "They really could not get financing in the private sector for some of their products they wanted to export overseas," Johnson said. Johnson also expressed satisfaction with proposed reforms to the way the bank is operated, including increased reserves to protect against loan losses. In short, the senator said, he changed his mind. Despite the Senate action, the bank is in limbo because the House adjourned before taking the matter up, although a reauthorization vote is could come as soon as Oct. 26, 2015. Other changes Johnson was not the only high profile politician to change his views on the bank. Former Texas governor and Republican presidential candidate Rick Perry did a switch in the other direction. He was for the bank in 2014, and then then against it a year later, in the midst of his short-lived presidential campaign. That was rated a Full Flop by PolitiFact Texas. In an op-ed column published by the Wall Street Journal, Perry noted that since since 2007, more than 1,200 Texas companies had obtained help from the Ex-Im Bank in financing more than $24 billion in exports. Still, Perry wrote, he "can't get on board" with reauthorizing the charter for the 80-year-old bank: "I have been deeply disturbed by recent revelations of corruption and bribery at the institution." Our rating Unlike Perry, Johnson has more than a rhetorical say in the future of the Export-Import Bank. He voted on reauthorization twice in the Senate. First against it, then for it. And that’s a Full Flop.	None	Ron Johnson	None	None	None	2015-10-20T14:30:42	2015-10-20	['None']
pomt-05587	"And the #jerseycomeback keeps rolling! Thanks to @GovChristie NJ now has lowest corruption risk of any state."	false	/new-jersey/statements/2012/apr/02/new-jersey-republican-state-committee/new-jersey-gop-credit-chris-christie-new-jersey-ha/	Soon after an article was published about a new study claiming New Jersey had the lowest risk of corruption in the nation, the state’s Republican Party told its Twitter followers the first-place finish was the result of the "comeback" led by Gov. Chris Christie. "And the #jerseycomeback keeps rolling! Thanks to @GovChristie NJ now has lowest corruption risk of any state," according to the March 19 tweet from the New Jersey Republican State Committee. But PolitiFact New Jersey found that the regulations behind New Jersey’s highest scores were put in place before Christie became governor. Christie, a Republican, has proposed a series of ethics reforms, but they’ve been stalled by the Democrat-controlled Legislature. Let’s explain the corruption risk investigation. The State Integrity Investigation was undertaken by journalists in every state, who analyzed 330 so-called "corruption risk indicators" across 14 categories. The analyses focused, in part, on the existence of certain laws and their effectiveness. On its report card, New Jersey received A grades in six categories, including State Pension Fund Management and Ethics Enforcement -- two categories where New Jersey ranked first. To analyze the Republicans’ tweet, we researched the origins of regulations cited within five of those categories. No laws were cited in the sixth category. Based on our review, all of those regulations were put into effect before Christie took office. Here’s a few examples: The report card points to various regulations governing lobbying activities, which Gov. Jim McGreevey updated with a series of laws enacted in June 2004. The New Jersey Conflicts of Interest Law, which covers various ethics rules, has been in effect since 1972. In January 2006, Gov. Richard Codey approved a bill to strengthen those regulations. Codey also signed a "pay-to-play" reform bill in March 2005, prohibiting state contracts of more than $17,500 for certain political donors. Gov. Jon Corzine expanded on those pay-to-play rules through an executive order in September 2008. The report card notes how Christie issued an executive order in April 2010 to specify who must file financial disclosure statements, but previous governors have taken similar actions. Through a spokesman, we asked journalist Colleen O’Dea, an editor-at-large at NJSpotlight, who conducted the investigation in New Jersey, about whether Christie’s reforms contributed to the state’s score. Here’s what she said: "I really have to tell you that there have been virtually none. Christie came in and has called for numerous reforms but has put through few, if any of those things our survey asked about." But Doug Mayer, spokesman for the New Jersey Republican State Committee, argued that Christie’s work as U.S. Attorney in prosecuting corruption cases led to an overall change in New Jersey’s political culture. "You would be hard pressed to find anyone in New Jersey, or the entire country for that matter, who doubts Governor Christie’s commitment or actual record on prosecuting political corruption. Some people don’t like to admit it, but the Governor’s record as a U.S. Attorney is impeccable and led directly to New Jersey’s overall change in political culture," Mayer said in an e-mail. "It is a fight he continues to this day with a substantial portion of his agenda dedicated to strengthening New Jersey’s ethics laws." However, such prosecutions did not factor into New Jersey’s score in the corruption risk investigation, according to Randy Barrett, spokesman for the Center for Public Integrity, one of the collaborators behind the project. "We weren’t looking at people, just the structures to deliver (or not) transparency and accountability," Barrett told us in an e-mail. Our ruling Referring to a nationwide investigation comparing states for their risk of corruption, New Jersey’s Republican Party claimed in a March 19 tweet: "Thanks to @GovChristie NJ now has lowest corruption risk of any state." But the regulations behind New Jersey’s highest scores were put in place before Christie became governor. As governor, Christie’s proposed ethics reforms have stalled in the Democrat-controlled Legislature. We rate the statement False. To comment on this ruling, go to NJ.com.

pomt-09937	Inside the stimulus package "is anti-Christian legislation that will stop churches from using public schools for meeting on Sundays, as well as Boy Scouts and student Bible study groups."	pants on fire!	/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/jun/08/newt-gingrich/stimulus-bill-wont-change-status-sunday-school/	In a fundraising e-mail, former House Speaker Newt Gingrich says that President Barack Obama is anti-Christian. "In fact, buried inside Obama's trillion-dollar stimulus package is anti-Christian legislation that will stop churches from using public schools for meeting on Sundays, as well as Boy Scouts and student Bible study groups," Gingrich wrote. The e-mail is part of Gingrich's fundraising efforts for an organization called Renewing American Leadership, which will "bring moral leadership back to our nation." We've looked before at a similar claim that the stimulus had an antireligion clause . It's based on the part of the bill that provides $3.5 billion for public and private colleges and universities to modernize, renovate or repair facilities. The bill says money may not be used for buildings that are "used for sectarian instruction or religious worship or a school or department of divinity; or in which a substantial portion of the functions of the facilities are subsumed in a religious mission." Back in February, before the stimulus had passed, we checked out a claim from Sen. Jim DeMint of South Carolina that the language would stop students from having prayer groups or Bible studies in their dorms. We found that it wouldn't. The courts have been clear that religious groups are entitled to the same equal access to public facilities as any other group. While someone might conceivably file a lawsuit against prayer groups or Bible studies in dorms, those lawsuits would fail, according to all the experts we consulted. Howard Simon of the ACLU said it was preposterous to claim that the ACLU would sue if students in a dorm want to share their faith or organize a Bible study, even if that dorm was renovated with federal funds. "On what basis would there be a lawsuit? There is a First Amendment in our country. People have a constitutional right to state their faith." Barry Lynn, executive director of Americans United for Separation of Church and State, said the language in the stimulus plan amounts to little more than boilerplate for federal legislation, similar to language used for decades in the Higher Education Facilities Act. It is simply designed, he said, to ensure that federal money isn't used to build churches and other religious facilities. But that doesn't mean religious groups can't use university facilities. The Supreme Court has consistently ruled that religious groups have as much right to equal access to public facilities as anyone else. For example, in 2001, the Supreme Court ruled in favor of the Good News Club, a private Christian organization for children, which had been barred from using a public school for weekly afterschool meetings. Back when the stimulus was still being debated, Robert Alt, deputy director of the Center for Legal and Judicial Studies at the conservative Heritage Foundation, argued that the language in the stimulus bill was written too broadly. Yes, he said, the Supreme Court has made clear what the law is on all this, so why add the language at all? The provision, as written, "would seem to permit a legal challenge" to all sorts of religious activity on college campuses in buildings renovated with federal funds, he said. Given the Supreme Court's decisions, though, wouldn't those challenges fail? "The Supreme Court precedent is perfectly clear," Alt said. "I think they would lose." The new aspect of Gingrich's claim is that the stimulus language would affect church groups that meet in public schools, and that the Boy Scouts would be considered an excluded religious group. Rick Tyler, founding director of Renewing American Leadership and a spokesman for Gingrich, said in an e-mail that these concerns were based on the same provision that DeMint was concerned about. But we find that's not plausible because the stimulus clause refers specifically to money for higher education, not elementary and secondary schools as Gingrich's comment about "public schools" suggests. And Gingrich's claim is ridiculously false because court rulings have consistently said that religious groups have the same equal access rights for the public schools. "The law is fairly settled," said Annie Laurie Gaylor, co-president of the Freedom from Religion Foundation. Her group opposes allowing church groups to meet in public schools, but it is legal, she said. She pointed to two cases that allow churches to use public school facilities just like everyone else: the 2001 Good News Club case we mentioned previously and a 1991 case called Lamb’s Chapel vs. Center Moriches Union Free School District . The stimulus bill uses "boilerplate language," she said. "That's not going to override two Supreme Court cases." We found little support for DeMint's claim back in February that the provision would mean that students couldn't meet in dorm rooms for Bible study. Gingrich's claim is even more ridiculous to suggest the Boy Scouts would be among those banned from public schools. In short, we haven't seen anything that supports Gingrich's claim that the stimulus will stop church groups from meeting at public schools, nor Boy Scouts or Bible study groups. In fact, the clause on religion does not even apply to public schools. Inasmuch as this one seems aimed at unnecessarily inflaming the conservative Christian base, we'd like to retort with some flames of our own.

pomt-04251	Says that with President Obama's re-election, state and federal income tax rates for some taxpayers will rise "to roughly 65 percent."	false	/wisconsin/statements/2012/nov/15/mike-white/obamas-re-election-federal-and-state-rates-wiscons/	Two weeks before the presidential election, the owner of a Milwaukee-based international manufacturer warned his employees of "personal consequences" if Barack Obama were re-elected. The Oct. 23, 2012 email from Rite-Hite owner Mike White spurred state and national news coverage, a complaint with the state election board and even a review by local prosecutors. The election is over, but some of White’s claims remain relevant. He began the email by saying: "Every Rite-­Hite employee in America should understand the personal consequences to them of having our tax rates increase dramatically if President Obama is re-elected, forcing taxpayers to fund President Obama's future deficits and social programs (including Obamacare), which require bigger government. "Rite-­Hite is a Subchapter S corporation for taxes, meaning that our corporate tax rate is the highest personal tax rate. So what? Well, our RSP (retirement savings program) contributions are based on after-tax profits. The tax rate we pay is not 17 percent, as Warren Buffett would have you believe; with state taxes it is roughly 45 percent." He continued by stating: "President Obama has announced that our planned tax rate would increase to roughly 65 percent, reducing our after tax income by 36 percent and dramatically reducing, if not eliminating, your and my RSP contributions." Obama, of course, was re-elected. Does that mean state and federal income tax rates are on their way up to a promised combined 65 percent for some taxpayers? Background Rite-Hite, which employs some 1,400 people in North and South America, Asia and Europe, specializes in the manufacture and sale of loading dock and industrial door safety products. White, the company’s chairman as well as owner, is active civically, serving on the boards of Milwaukee’s Summerfest, which is billed as the world’s largest music festival; the Village of River Hills, an upscale Milwaukee suburb; and the foundation of Concordia University Wisconsin. He’s also a contributor to Republican candidates. We’re leaving aside the question of whether White’s email amounted to voter intimidation, which the local district attorney’s office is still reviewing. White said in the e-mail that neither he nor his company "will ever prejudice any employee for their political views." There are also lingering questions about the company’s plans in the wake of Obama’s re-election. Neither White nor his company's attorney responded to our requests for information about the claim of tax rates rising to 65 percent. But we can break it down. White’s e-mail said RiteHite is an "S corporation" and that "our corporate tax rate is the highest personal tax rate." Shareholders of an S corporation report the business’ income on their personal tax returns and are assessed tax at their individual income tax rates, according to the Internal Revenue Service. The highest individual tax rate is 35 percent, which is for people with an income above $388,350. So, White’s claim focuses on these high-income taxpayers. Increasing rates Obama has proposed eliminating what are known as the Bush-era tax cuts, enacted under President George W. Bush, for individuals earning more than $200,000 and married couples earning more than $250,000. That would raise the top federal rate to 39.6 percent. As for Wisconsin, its highest income tax rate is 7.75 percent. It is not slated to increase; in fact, Gov. Scott Walker has pledged to cut income taxes, perhaps in his 2013-15 budget. Add the top state rate of 7.75 percent to the highest federal rate proposed by Obama, 39.6 percent, and you get just over 47 percent -- slightly more than the 45 percent White said Rite-Hite is paying. To further analyze White’s claim, we contacted several experts, including Milwaukee tax attorney John Vitek; Wisconsin Taxpayers Alliance research director Dale Knapp; and Jack Norman, director of Tax Fairness WI, a joint project of two left-leaning Wisconsin organizations. Each said the new combined state-federal rate that Rite-Hite will pay as a result of Obama's re-election could exceed 50 percent: 39.6 percent -- new top federal rate proposed by Obama 7.75 percent -- top Wisconsin rate (unchanged) 3.8 percent -- tax hike, starting in 2013, as part of "Obamacare" (the hike is on capital gains, dividend and interest income of high-income earners) 2.35 percent -- Medicare tax (includes an increase of 0.9 percent under Obamacare) 53.5 percent -- total combined rate So, that’s a significant increase. But it’s also well short of 65 percent. Two final notes: Vitek, the tax lawyer, said Rite-Hite doesn’t actually pay the taxes to the government; rather, it pays dividends to its shareholders to cover the taxes they are assessed as shareholders of Rite-Hite. Norman, the tax fairness group director (who wrote an analysis of White's e-mail), notes that tax rates are progressive -- you pay lower rates on the first portions of your income and higher rates on the higher portions. For example, the federal tax rate is 10 percent on income up to $17,400; the rate is 15 percent on income between $17,400 and $70,700; and so on. Norman's point is that high-earners like White pay the highest rate, currently 35 percent, only on the portion of income above $388,340. Our rating The owner of Milwaukee-based manufacturer Rite-Hite said that with Obama's re-election, the combined state and federal tax rate paid by his company would rise to about 65 percent. Experts say the rate might exceed 50 percent, but they see no way of it reaching 65 percent. We don't have the benefit of White's math to consider, but barring any other evidence, we rate his claim False.	None	Mike White	None	None	None	2012-11-15T09:00:00	2012-10-23	['Barack_Obama']
pomt-03488	The problem of unwanted sexual contacts in the military "is not just a woman's issue. More than half of the victims are men."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2013/jun/11/kirsten-gillibrand/sex-crimes-military-gillibrand-says-over-half-vict/	Congress is putting pressure on the American military to crack down on rape and other types of sexual crimes. The latest Department of Defense report estimates that last year there were 26,000 incidents of unwanted sexual contact ranging from groping to forced sex. Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, D-N.Y., was talking about the full gamut of these offenses on Face the Nation on June 9, 2013. While much of the focus has been on women, Gillibrand emphasized that "this is not just a woman's issue. More than half of the victims are men." This seemed like a strong rhetorical point that deserved a closer look. PolitiFact examined a related claim by Gillibrand in April when she cited a survey that asked soldiers whether they had had any unwanted sexual contact by a fellow soldier at any point since joining the military. Given the long tenure of some service members, that question can cover a span of many years. Gillibrand said that 21.7 percent of women and 3.3 percent of men responded yes and we rated her statement Mostly True. Her latest claim is different in that she’s speaking more broadly about the gender of the victims. The Department of Defense defines unwanted sexual contact as "contact that was against a person’s will or occurred when the person did not or could not consent. The term describes completed and attempted oral, anal, and vaginal penetration with any body part or object, and the unwanted touching of genitalia and other sexually related areas of the body." The military uses this definition in an annual survey of soldiers and uses the answers to make a statistical estimate of the total number of incidents that took place. That's how military officials came up with the figure of 26,000. Generally speaking, the survey asks about three levels of contact: unwanted touching, attempted sex and completed sex. In that survey, 6.1 percent of active duty women reported that they had been a victim in some fashion. On the other hand, just 1.2 percent of active duty men described having those sorts of experiences. At first glance, the numbers might suggest that Gillibrand had it wrong. But Glen Caplin, her communications director, said she was correct because her tally used the percentages to extrapolate the actual count of men and women in the military who have been victims of unwanted sexual contact. In round figures, about 85 percent of the military are men, or well over 1 million. Caplin said 1.2 percent of the men in the military is about 14,000, while 6.1 percent of active duty women is about 12,000. "So it is more men than women," Caplin said. We checked with the Department of Defense press office and spokeswoman Cynthia Smith confirmed Caplin’s numbers. We did find another measurement of the gender differences that seems to tell a different story. In the full 2012 annual report on Sexual Assault Prevention and Response, the Pentagon includes the survey results along with a very different set of numbers -- the cases that made it into the official record. The second data set is much smaller, less than 3,000 cases. It represents formal allegations filed by victims plus instances when victims seeking treatment report a violation to a health care provider or staff at a sexual assault prevention office but might not file official charges. In that official record, women represent about 80 percent or more of the cases. The large disparity between the total number of men who responded in the survey that they had been victims and the relatively small number who sought treatment or made an official complaint is likely due in part to the greater reluctance of men to report unwanted sexual contact. Dr. David Lisak, an associate professor of Psychology at the University of Massachusetts, Boston, and founder of One In Six, an advocacy group for sexually abused men, said it is no surprise that male soldiers rarely disclose assaults. "Men are taught from a very young age that the core elements of masculinity are strength and toughness, and that vulnerability is completely unacceptable," Lisak said. "In a culture such as the military, where the culture of traditional masculinity is often more rigidly enforced than it is in the civilian world, the stigma associated with sexual assault is intensified." It also seems that on the spectrum of unwanted sexual contact, men often faced less aggressive situations. In the survey, half the men said the most serious incident they experienced was "sexual touching only," while only a third of women said that was the worst thing. In comparison, over half of the women said they had been the victim of an unwanted sexual act that had either been attempted or completed. Only about 15 percent of men in total said they were the victim of an attempted or a completed sexual act. Our ruling Gillibrand said more than half the victims of sexual crimes in the military are men. That's not true in terms of the 3,000 sexual contacts that were officially reported, but it is true if you rely on the larger estimate of unwanted sexual contacts that comes from a more comprehensive survey of people in the military. We rate the statement Mostly True.	None	Kirsten Gillibrand	None	None	None	2013-06-11T11:09:34	2013-06-09	['None']

pomt-13959	Says Apple products are currently "90 percent conflict-free," and "Intel is 100 percent conflict-free."	mostly false	/global-news/statements/2016/jun/15/robin-wright/did-your-phone-computer-contribute-suffering-congo/	As you’re texting away on that snazzy smartphone, you may be "holding war" in your hands, says actress and activist Robin Wright. Wright, known for her roles in House of Cards, Forrest Gump, and The Princess Bride, compared minerals extracted in the Democratic Republic of Congo for electronics to blood diamonds in a recent speech and urged consumers to learn more about their electronics. "I do have an Apple iPhone. And Apple is 90 percent conflict-free currently," Wright said May 25. "Intel is 100 percent conflict-free. They are the biggest distributor of the chip. That’s huge." Are the vast majority of Apple and Intel products made without financing war in the Democratic Republic of Congo? The answer is complicated. While both Apple and Intel are commended by human rights groups for their leadership in transparency, Wright’s numbers are off. More importantly, experts told us it’s impossible to ensure that anything is completely conflict-free. Conflict minerals, a primer The Democratic Republic of Congo’s rich mineral deposits, worth about $24 trillion, supply the world’s demand for electronics and fund militias that have been warring with each other and the government for decades. Rebel groups like the Lord’s Resistance Army (remember Kony?) and the Congolese military itself loot or seize control of mines in the Kivu region. These mines are notorious for their rampant human rights abuses. The minerals eventually find their way into cell phones, computers, and other products. Armed groups earned an estimated $184 million from just four minerals in 2008 alone. Here’s a video from Enough Project, a human rights group, on how it all works: Corporate reporting Wright may have been thinking of figures in Apple’s and Intel’s filings to the Securities and Exchange Commission, but she misstated a few things. As part of the 2010 Dodd-Frank Act, publically traded companies are required disclose use of conflict minerals — specifically tin, tantalum, tungsten and gold — annually to the SEC. In 2014, Apple reported 88 percent of its smelters and refineries were verified as conflict-free or participating in third-party auditing programs. That same year, Intel said 100 percent of microprocessors and chipsets were conflict-free, but it couldn’t determine if the label applied to other products. Both companies improved their numbers in 2015, according to their latest SEC filings. About 78 percent of Intel’s smelters and refineries were deemed conflict-free. Apple stated 100 percent of its smelters and refiners are in audits but said it does not believe verification was sufficient to label its products "conflict-free." Here’s a chart showing how the two stack up next to other companies: *Apple rejects the label conflict-free **No 2015 report was available; numbers taken from 2014 report. Google and its subsidiary, Motorola, also did not report number of firms participating in audits. ***SanDisk was unable to determine whether their any of their products included conflict minerals or were conflict-free. Aspirations vs. reality But experts told us participating in audits or even being deemed in compliance doesn’t guarantee that the minerals are actually conflict-free for several reasons. "Our position is companies should not be allowed to make those types of statements," said Seema Joshi, Amnesty International's Head of Business and Human Rights. Laura Seay, a Colby College professor who studies the African Great Lakes, said ensuring a 100 percent conflict-free global supply chain is near impossible. Carly Oboth, a policy adviser for the watchdog NGO, Global Witness, called the designation "hypothetical and aspirational." According to Oboth, smelters and refineries receive verification based on their capacity to do due diligence (i.e. chain of custody documentation and proof of insurance), not whether they’ve taken the steps to ensure their supplies were actually mined humanely. The auditing regiment is currenting being revised, Oboth said, "but for the time being, there’s no oversight on whether they’re negating risks." And while Global Witness commended Apple for its decision to reject the "conflict-free," Oboth said it and Intel could be doing more. (AP Photo) There are few means to verify in the conflict-ridden eastern part of the country where many mines are located. Beyond issues of accessibility, miners and the armed groups have found ways of circumventing the system. The majority of minerals are being smuggled into neighboring countries with higher profit margins and much less rigorous certification methods, if they exist at all, Seay told us. ITR, a tin auditing firm, prices a kilo of tin at $2 while the same amount would fetch $4 or $5 in Rwanda. "If you can get your minerals, which may or may not be conflict-free, into Rwanda, you can get it labeled conflict-free," she said. "Do you take the $2 or do you hire a boat and go to Rwanda? It’s a no brainer." And even if the minerals stay in the country, Seay pointed out, the audit system has spurred a cottage industry for conflict-free labels: "You can also buy the tag in the markets in Kigali. All the incentives are set up for people to lie." Labels as lip service Then there’s the question of whether conflict-free labeling actually curbs violence and protects human rights. The evidence is mixed. Dodd-Frank didn’t work out as planned initially. The Congolese government enacted a temporary ban on mining and companies avoided sourcing from the region altogether. For one of the poorest countries in the world where mining employs one sixth of its population, Dodd-Frank "set off a chain of events that has has propelled millions of miners and their families deeper into poverty." Meanwhile, there were few signs that it had tempered violence or weakened the militias. But now that the ban has ended and companies are once again buying from the Democratic Republic of Congo, experts view Dodd-Frank a bit more positively. Seay, an initial critic, says it’s draw attention to the issue. "It got the attention of the Congolese government in a way that nothing else could have," she said, adding, "A lot of is lip service and a lot of is how much facade we should put up." (Screengrab from When Elephants Fight) A 2015 report by the International Peace Information Search, a development research institute, found that armed groups have been cut off from many tin, tantalum, tungsten mines, but still profit from gold. Seay said they’ve savvied up (i.e. by removing guards with machine guns from the mines) while finding funding sources in border crossings, charcoal, "conflict weed", wildlife smuggling, etc. The narrow focus of Dodd-Frank also means that "conflict-free" isn’t the same thing as abuse-free. Amnesty has documented child labor in the DRC’s production of cobalt, which is not designated as a "conflict mineral." Global Witness found lapis lazuli funds the Taliban, but Dodd-Frank doesn’t apply because the mines are in Afghanistan. "You can have a completely clean mine, as designated by Dodd-Frank, with child laborers and where woman are trading sex with the pit bosses in order to sell lunch around the periphery," Seay said. "There’s no such thing as 100 percent conflict-free anything." Our ruling Wright said Apple products are currently "90 percent conflict-free," and "Intel is 100 percent conflict-free." The numbers are off. Intel says 100 percent of is processors are conflict-free, but couldn’t vouch for its other products. Apple reported that 100 percent of its supply chain was participating in audits, but rejected the label. While experts commend both companies for leading the sector in moving away from conflict minerals, they cautioned against labeling anything 100 percent "conflict-free." We rate Wright’s claim Mostly False. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/6012a2b8-893f-45e6-ba1e-9220fa3d64e7	None	Robin Wright	None	None	None	2016-06-15T15:00:00	2016-05-25	['None']
pomt-02952	Says Barbara Buono "voted to raise her own pay 40 percent."	mostly true	/new-jersey/statements/2013/oct/27/chris-christie/chris-christie-ad-claims-barbara-buono-voted-give-/	Politicians and pay raises go about as well together as oil and water, from a taxpayer’s perspective. And Gov. Chris Christie knows it. That might explain why one of his latest gubernatorial TV campaign ads targeting Democratic challenger Barbara Buono, a state senator, claims she voted to give herself a significant salary bump during her time in the Legislature. Buono "voted to raise her own pay 40 percent," the ad claims, from $35,000 to $49,000, as it points out differences between the two candidates in areas of education, taxes and more. The election is Nov. 5. Buono was an Assembly member when she voted to raise her salary, but the ad doesn’t mention a couple of key points: the sponsor of the legislation for the hikes is a Republican friend and ally of Christie’s, and the vote happened nearly 14 years ago. Let’s review the history behind the bill in question, S2297, and where Buono fits in. Republican state Sen. Joe Kyrillos Jr. -- Christie’s close friend -- and Sen. Bernard F. Kenny, a Democrat from Hudson County, sponsored the bill, which was introduced on Jan. 6, 2000. It called for increasing the salaries of the governor, judges, cabinet members, county prosecutors and members of the Legislature. In advocating for the bill, Kyrillos of Monmouth County noted in multiple published reports at the time that lawmakers hadn’t had a raise in 12 years and that a raise was warranted because lawmakers’ jobs had become "demanding." Both houses of the Legislature passed the bill on Jan. 10, 2000. For legislators, the result was the 40 percent hike. Buono (D-Metuchen) voted for the raise, the nonpartisan Office of Legislative Services confirmed. By comparison, the gubernatorial salary increased from $130,000 to $175,000 -- an approximate 35 percent hike. The governor at the time was Christine Todd Whitman, a Republican. The salary increases for governor and Legislature members didn’t take effect until January 2002, while salary hikes for judges, prosecutors, cabinet members and others had their pay increased upon enactment of the law. In addition to Buono’s vote, we also reviewed OLS documents showing how every other member of the Legislature voted on the salary hike bill. The votes were essentially an even split in the 80-member Assembly. Of 48 Republicans, 32 voted in favor, 15 voted against and one lawmaker didn’t vote. Among 32 Democrats, 16 - including Buono - voted in favor, 13 voted against and three didn’t vote. The state’s 40 senators had a similar tally. Among 24 Republicans, 13 voted yes, seven voted no and four didn’t vote. Eight Democrats voted for the bill, seven voted against it and one didn’t vote. That means the bill passed the Republican-controlled Senate and Assembly. The Republican role in the pay hike can’t be discounted, according to Buono’s campaign. "Governor Christie has repeatedly used a specious claim that omits key details," spokesman Sam Salustro said in an e-mail. "This was legislation sponsored by a key Christie ally who intensely fought for its passage, passed by a Republican legislature and signed by a Republican governor. The Governor has benefited from the law and is one of the only New Jersey governors in recent memory to take the full salary. So before he throws stones, he should take a look at his own party first." The bottom line is Buono’s vote, Christie’s campaign spokesman said. "So, in short, Barbara Buono cast a vote to raise her salary by 40% while embarking on a career of voting to raise taxes and fees on New Jerseyans 154 times and neither she nor her campaign is disputing it," spokesman Kevin Roberts said in an e-mail. Our ruling A recent TV ad from the Christie gubernatorial campaign claims Buono "voted to raise her own pay 40 percent." OLS documents show that members of the state’s 208th Legislature, including Buono in the Assembly, voted to raise salaries for themselves, the governor, cabinet members, county prosecutors and more. It’s worth noting, however, that the bill was sponsored by Christie friend and political ally Joe Kyrillos, passed by a Republican-controlled Legislature and signed into law by a Republican governor -- nearly 14 years ago. So yes, Buono voted to raise her salary 40 percent -- with a heap of help from her Republican friends and colleagues. Since the claim is accurate but needs clarification or additional information, we rate it Mostly True. To comment on this story, go to NJ.com.

pomt-01079	"There’s nothing in the [RhodeMap RI] plan that takes away local government control and local zoning control."	half-true	/rhode-island/statements/2015/jan/16/kevin-flynn/ri-planner-kevin-flynn-nothing-rhodemap-ri-plan-ta/	The RhodeMap RI long-term economic development plan continues to spark controversy throughout Rhode Island. This week, Republican legislators said they would submit legislation to free municipalities from having to incorporate it in their local planning. That follows comments House Speaker Nicholas Mattiello made in December to radio station WPRO-AM. Mattiello said, "the plan is never going to come before the House or the Senate in its totality and we’re never going to vote on it." The controversy started in mid-September with the release of a 200-page draft of the plan, which is meant to guide efforts to improve the state’s economy. During meetings that sometimes descended into shouting matches, critics said that if RhodeMap RI were implemented, local cities and towns would be relinquishing control to the federal government on affordable housing and land-use issues because the plan was paid for, in part, by a $1.9 million U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development grant. Supporters said there's nothing in the plan that would infringe on individual property rights or local control over zoning. Because the debate is likely to continue in the coming months, we decided to examine a statement made late last year by Kevin M. Flynn, associate director for planning for the state Division of Planning, who oversaw the plan’s development. Addressing concerns about ceding municipal control, Flynn told EcoRI News, "there’s nothing in the plan that takes away local government control and local zoning control." We asked Flynn how he backed up his statement. While we waited for a response, we read through the RhodeMap RI plan, and found nothing to indicate a threat to local control, suggesting Flynn’s statement was accurate. But things got more complicated when we looked at other documents, including the Planning Division’s grant application, the grant agreement, and HUD’s description of the Sustainable Regional Planning Grant Program, the source of the $1.9 million. According to HUD, the program is intended to support planning efforts that integrate land use, economic and workforce development, transportation and infrastructure investments. It also aims to enable local and state planners to consider such issues as energy use, climate change, public health and "social equity" in economic planning. Agencies that apply for such grants must agree to generate plans aimed at producing, among other objectives, "equitable land use planning" that furthers the federal Fair Housing Act and complies with other civil rights laws. And those agencies must agree to analyze and overcome barriers to housing discrimination -- in HUD’s words, to "affirmatively further fair housing." Critics view those provisions with alarm, saying they essentially give the federal government license to override state and local government control. They point to a long-running legal dispute involving New York’s Westchester County as Exhibit A. More on that in a moment. When Flynn got back to us, he referred us to Article XIII of the Rhode Island Constitution, which empowers cities and towns to adopt and amend their charters, and enact and amend local land use laws. He also cited state zoning enabling legislation, which delegates zoning authority to cities and towns. "A plan is simply that. A plan," Flynn said. "A plan has no power to modify constitutional or statutory law." "The economic development plan could never supercede state law," he said. "That is a basic tenet of our jurisprudence." Looking for more impartial views, we reached out to more than 10 national housing law experts. The four who responded agreed that communities do not cede zoning control when they accept HUD grants. But they had some caveats. For example, Brian Gilmore, an associate professor and director of the Housing Clinic at Michigan State University College of Law, said, "I wouldn’t say they’ve ceded total control. I would say they have obligations." Robert G. Schwemm, a professor at the University of Kentucky College of Law, said much the same thing. "It’s illegal to use local zoning power to maintain segregation," Schwemm said. However, "HUD has no direct power over local zoning authority," Schwemm said. "HUD could deny the grant or take back money," but that’s a remote possibility, he said. "The idea of a fund cutoff is virtually unheard of," because historically, the Fair Housing Act "has been enforced weakly. … They’re doing more than has been done in the past," he said of the Obama administration. HUD’s Annual Report on Fair Housing 2012-2013 showed that the agency received 495 analyses by cities and towns examining fair housing choice. Of those, HUD took enforcement action in five instances. Here’s why Westchester County is important. In 2006, a housing advocacy group sued the county in federal court, arguing that it had defrauded taxpayers by accepting $50 million in HUD grant money while failing to remove barriers to fair housing as required by its agreement with HUD. HUD later became a plaintiff in the suit. A judge ultimately agreed with the plaintiffs, and a landmark settlement was reached requiring the county to spend $50 million to build or acquire 750 affordable-housing units in communities that were more than 90 percent white. Now, the county and HUD are fighting over whether the county has complied with the settlement and whether it must amend its zoning ordinances to do so. The county has lost at least $20 million in HUD grants so far. We contacted the county for its take on HUD grants and local control. "The experience in Westchester has been caveat emptor," said Ned McCormack, Westchester communications director and senior adviser to County Executive Robert P. Astorino, using the Latin phrase for "buyer beware." "Once you take any money from HUD, your interpretation of what is expected in return and their interpretation vary widely." Our ruling Kevin M. Flynn said nothing in the RhodeMap RI plan "takes away local government control and local zoning control." Technically, there is nothing in the plan’s language that appears to compromise local zoning law or control. But his statement doesn’t acknowledge the strings attached to the HUD grant. In accepting the $1.9 million from HUD to develop the plan, the state agreed to, among other things, expand housing opportunities for underserved populations on the basis of race, ethnicity, or economic status and, thus, is obligated to do so. In fact, HUD has taken legal action against grant recipients such as Westchester County that, in its view, failed to live up to its agreement. It’s rare, but it has happened. For the record, in December, 26 Rhode Island cities and towns were awarded nearly $5.3 million in HUD grants through the Community Development Block Grant program On balance, we rate Flynn’s claim is "partially accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of context," our definition of Half True.

pomt-05431	Gas prices have gone up 99 percent since Obama became president, "the highest gas price increase since Carter."	mostly false	/rhode-island/statements/2012/apr/29/national-republican-congressional-committee/national-republican-congressional-committee-says-g/	We received an email from the National Republican Congressional Committee recently that blamed the country’s high gas prices on the Obama administration and Democrats in Congress. The news release, which specifically targeted Rhode Island Democratic U.S. Rep. David Cicilline, posited several reasons why gas prices have skyrocketed, including unreasonable environmental regulations and too few offshore drilling permits. The overall effect on gas prices has been historic, according to the GOP committee. "99%: THE AMOUNT GAS PRICES HAVE INCREASED UNDER OBAMA, THE HIGHEST GAS PRICE INCREASE SINCE CARTER," the April 20 email blared. A quick check of two numbers in the release -- $1.928 per gallon, the national average price of regular, unleaded gas in February 2009, versus $3.843 per gallon, the price on March 29, 2012 -- confirmed that prices have indeed climbed by 99 percent since Obama’s inauguration. But what about the second part of the claim: is this really the highest increase since Jimmy Carter was president more than three decades ago? And is the implication that Obama is responsible for the increase accurate? At PolitiFact, we treat these types of blame/credit statements in two parts. We examine whether the numbers are right and how much experts say the person being blamed is responsible. Let’s start with the claim that the gas price increase is the highest since the Carter administration. Nathaniel Sillin, a spokesman for the NRCC, told us that the group came to that conclusion by looking at the presidencies from Carter onward and comparing the average gas price at the beginning of each president’s time in office with the price at the end. Since Obama is still in office, the committee is using the most recent price of gas for the number during his presidency. Sillin sent us a chart updated with the average price of gas from April 4. The chart showed that under Carter the price of gas increased by 103 percent; under Ronald Reagan it dropped by 66 percent; under George H.W. Bush it went up 20 percent; under Bill Clinton it increased 32 percent; under George W. Bush it rose 20 percent; and so far under Obama it has gone up 104 percent. So according to the updated chart the NRCC could actually claim that the increase is higher than that under Carter. The NRCC chart was based on data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics and AAA. We decided to check their prices with the U.S. Energy Information Administration, the official statistical and analytical arm of the Department of Energy. The only major difference we found using the EIA data was that the drop in price under Reagan wasn’t as dramatic as the NRCC said. Instead of a 66-percent decrease, the EIA database gave us a still healthy decrease of 37 percent. And using the EIA data, the increase under Obama so far is actually 107 percent. But we have two main questions about the NRCC’s claim. First, is it fair to compare gas prices during Obama’s presidency in April to prices for his predecessors in January? Historically, gas prices generally rise through the summer, and fall in the autumn -- and this year they are projected to once again follow that pattern. (The price peaked last year in May.) For an extreme example, look at 2008, during George W. Bush’s presidency, when gas prices skyrocketed to more than $4 a gallon that July and plummeted to $1.79 a gallon the following January. If we look at the price that April -- the same month the NRCC used for Obama in its claim -- and compare it to the first month of Bush’s term, then the increase would have been 139 percent. That increase is in fact higher than Carter’s 103 percent or Obama’s 107 percent. And if we use the highest price in 2008, from August, and compare it with Bush’s first month in office, the increase is a whopping 180 percent. We also calculated the increase using precisely the same length of time for Bush that the NRCC used for Obama. So we compared the price in February 2005, the first month of his second term, to the price in April 2008 and came up with an increase of 81 percent. When we did the same calculation using January 2009 as the end date, we came up with a decrease of 6 percent. Again, this demonstrates how prices can change seasonally. Our second major question relates to the premise of the NRCC’s assertion -- that Obama is responsible for high gas prices. How much control does a president really have over gas prices? "Virtually none," Tom Kloza, chief oil analyst for Oil Price Information Service of New Jersey, told us. "The real factors are global." "Oil is a global market in which America is a big consumer but a small supplier," Richard Thaler, a University of Chicago economist who has donated to Obama and informally advised his administration, wrote in The New York Times. "We consume about 20 percent of the world’s oil but hold only 2 percent of the oil reserves. That means we are, in economics jargon, ‘price takers.’ "Domestic production has increased during the Obama administration, but it has had minimal effects on global prices because, as producers, we are just too small to matter much. And even if domestic oil companies further increased production, they would sell to the highest global bidder." With supplies tightening because of conflicts in North Africa and the Middle East and demand growing in China and Japan (which shut down its fleet of nuclear power plants), the price of oil is going up, according to analysts. Fears about a disruption to oil production in Iran have increased the upward pressure. "Unfortunately, presidents get blamed for world market changes that occur during their time in office... but generally, they do not cause them," wrote Peter Van Doren and Jerry Taylor, senior fellows at the libertarian Cato Institute in Washington, D.C. Our ruling The National Republican Congressional Committee said that gas prices have increased by 99 percent since Obama became president and that it’s "the highest gas price increase since Carter." The NRCC framed the question in such a way that it didn’t make an apples-to-apples comparison between presidencies. Seasonal fluctuations in gas prices could easily change the NRCC’s calculation for Obama’s presidency -- a variation the committee didn’t note in its news release. It also didn’t say that it was comparing the first and last months of a president’s term. The release implies that gas prices haven’t risen so high percentage-wise at any time under any other president since Carter. But that’s not true. When George W. Bush was in office, the national average price rose much higher by percent before falling. Finally, blaming presidents for gas prices is missing the point. Presidents have little control over them. The global economy is the prime factor. We rule the statement Mostly False. (Get updates from PolitiFactRI on Twitter.

pomt-02650	"Only 3 percent of voters 18 to 34 don't believe that climate change is really happening."	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2014/jan/15/chris-murphy/sen-chris-murphy-says-just-3-percent-voters-dont-b/	More than a dozen Senate Democrats called a news conference on Jan. 14, 2014, to draw attention to their efforts to curb climate change. One of those senators -- Chris Murphy, D-Conn. -- focused his remarks on the impact of public opinion on advancing an agenda on climate-change policy. Murphy said that advocates for policies to address climate-change "have to convince Republicans -- and those who would stand against the action that we're proposing -- of the electoral consequences of continuing to ignore this issue. We have to tell Republicans that if they ultimately want to stop the hemorrhaging from young voters in this country, they need to start paying attention to this issue, because only 3 percent of voters 18 to 34 don't believe that climate change is really happening." We wondered whether Murphy’s polling data was sound. Thanks to some previous reporting by our colleagues at PolitiFact Rhode Island, we quickly found a poll that appears to be the source for Murphy’s claim. It was commissioned by the League of Conservation Voters, an environmental group, and conducted by a polling team that included one Democratic firm and one Republican firm. The poll was taken between July 8 and July 10, 2013, with 600 respondents, all of whom were registered voters between 18 and 34 who voted in the 2012 general election. The poll asked, "Which of the following best describes your view of climate change?" Here are the responses: • Climate change is a severe threat that we must start addressing now: 55 percent • Climate change is an issue to address in the years ahead, but it's not urgent now: 11 percent • Climate change may be happening, but it's a natural event that humans can't affect: 27 percent • Climate change is not really happening: 3 percent • Don't know: 3 percent This appears to support Murphy’s claim. We should note a few quibbles. • The poll was paid for by an environmental group. We always believe it’s worth noting whenever someone cites a poll paid for by a group with a perspective and a stake in the issue. However, the fact that two polling firms, one from each party, were included makes the poll somewhat more credible. • On a subsequent question in the same poll -- "When, if ever, will the consequences of climate change personally affect people like you?" -- the number answering "never" was 6 percent. That’s higher than 3 percent, though both are small percentages in the larger scheme of things. • There’s one other poll that asks a similar question and finds different results. But they aren’t exactly comparable. The Pew Research Center -- an independent polling organization -- surveyed a national sample of 1,504 adults age 18 or older between Oct. 9 and Oct. 13, 2013. One of the questions Pew asked was: "From what you’ve read and heard, is there solid evidence that the average temperature on earth has been getting warmer over the past few decades, or not?" Among 18- to 29-year-olds, 73 percent said the earth is warming, and 18 percent said it was not warming -- quite a bit higher than the 3 percent from the other poll. The two polls use different age ranges, but if respondents up to age 34 were added in, that would likely increase the percentage of global-warming deniers further, since an even higher percentage of 30- to 49-year olds said there was no global warming -- 28 percent. Why such divergent responses? One factor could be the precise wording of each poll. But a bigger difference is likely the pool of respondents. The LCV poll only counted answers from "registered voters … who voted in the 2012 general election," while the Pew poll simply asked "adults." This means the poll results aren’t comparable in an apples-to-apples fashion. This difference might have posed a problem for Murphy, but he was careful with how he worded his claim. He said "3 percent of voters" -- not "3 percent of Americans." So we don’t find fault on these grounds. "Pollsters don’t ask about climate change very often," said Karlyn Bowman, a polling analyst at the conservative American Enterprise Institute. "Most polls show that most people believe global warming is real. The question for policy makers is what kind of priority it should be, and here, many pollsters show it not to be very high." Our ruling Murphy said, "Only 3 percent of voters 18 to 34 don't believe that climate change is really happening." It should be noted that Murphy cited a poll that had been paid for by an environmental group. Still, we couldn’t find any poll with genuinely comparable data that clashed with Murphy’s carefully worded assertion. We rate his statement True.

pomt-00987	"If you look at the income of average Americans...they’re absolutely flat in constant dollars since 1979."	mostly true	/virginia/statements/2015/feb/09/don-beyer/beyer-says-middle-class-incomes-have-been-flat-197/	U.S. Rep. Don Beyer, D-8th, recently called on Congress to "jump start" the economy for middle-class Americans. "If you look at the income of average Americans -- working-class Americans, middle-class Americans -- they’re absolutely flat in constant dollars since 1979," Beyer said during a Feb. 4 speech to the Arlington County Democratic Party. We reviewed his claim. Tia Shuyler, Beyer’s press secretary, said her boss heard about the statistic late last year during an orientation for freshmen congressmen at Harvard University. She also sent us an October 2014 article from the Pew Research Center headlined, "For most workers, real wages have barely budged in decades." Pew relied on statistics from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Let’s take a closer look: The data that measure Beyer’s claim are called "median usual weekly earnings." To compute it, BLS compiles the gross weekly paycheck earnings of a sample of all private sector employees in all industries, then establishes the midpoint figure at which half of the workers are earning more and half are earning less. At the start of 1979 -- as far back as the data goes -- median weekly pay was $232 in unadjusted dollars and that rose to $796 during the final quarter of 2014. When adjusted for inflation, the figures don’t move much. The early 1979 weekly pay is worth $757 in 2014 dollars. So in constant dollars, median weekly pay rose by $39 from the start of 1979 to the end of last year, a 5 percent increase. Beyer, of course, said the inflation-adjusted numbers are "absolutely flat" since 1979. The BLS data support his claim if you start counting in the third quarter of 1979 when median weekly pay was worth $792 in today’s money. That results in a $1 weekly decline in median earnings over the last 35 years, or about one-tenth of 1 percent. The status of the middle class is an emerging issue moving towards next year’s presidential elections. Several studies show that the holdings of the top 1 percent have soared during recent decades, spurring many Democrats to complain about a growing gap between the wealthy and the middle class. The BLS figures Beyer relies on are not the final word on median income, according to Gary Burtless, an economist at the Brookings Institution, a nonpartisan research group. Another way of looking at it, he said, is to use data from the U.S. Census Bureau. It shows median household income before taxes, using 2013 dollars, rose from $49,225 in 1979 to $51,939 in 2013, an increase of 5.5 percent. That’s pretty close to flat growth. But Burtless said widely used methods of examining gross income undercounts certain forms of compensation and gives short shrift to middle class gains over the decades. Burtless prefers a broader measure of income used by the Congressional Budget Office in a November 2014 report. The CBO based it’s computation of household earnings on several factors, including after-tax wages, other earnings, retirement income and benefits including employer-based health coverage and government subsidies. The CBO concluded that median household after-tax income, when adjusted in 2011 dollars, was $26,200 in 1979 and $38,500 in 2011, the latest year figures that were available. That’s a 47 percent increase. Broken down on an annual basis, that comes out to a 1.3 percent income increase each year. Our ruling Beyer says the income of middle-class Americans has been "absolutely flat" since 1979. He supports that claim by pointing to oft-cited Bureau of Labor and Statistics data showing little or no inflation-adjusted growth in the median gross wage of workers over the last 35 years. An analysis of Census Bureau data yields similar results. Economists, however, define income in far broader terms than individual gross wages. A wider examination of income by the Congressional Budget Office -- which includes other earnings, benefits and tax payments -- shows median household income has increased by 47 percent over the last generation. So there’s plenty of evidence backing Beyer’s claim, but it doesn’t win unanimous support from economists. We rate his statement Mostly True.

A remark earlier in the town-hall session by Sensenbrenner about Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel’s plans to downsize the Army’s troop strength caught our attention. "With respect to the president’s budget proposal, there the recommendation was that we have an Army of fewer personnel than we had before Pearl Harbor," Sensenbrenner said when asked about survivor’s benefits. "That’s ridiculous and outrageous." Let’s put that one on our Truth-O-Meter. When we asked Sensenbrenner spokesman Ben Miller for backup on the historical comparison, he referred us to the U.S. Department of Defense’s budget request for fiscal year 2015. It quoted the Quadrennial Defense Review 2014. That five-year plan says the active Army will reduce its "end strength" to between 440,000 and 450,000 personnel. The current active-duty figure is about 520,000, Army spokesman Troy Rolan told us. Miller also pointed to stories in the New York Times, and a Milwaukee Journal Sentinel story that included Associated Press reporting on Hagel’s budget. The Times piece said that "cuts proposed by the Obama administration would result in the smallest Army since just before the World War II buildup." The AP report said the active-duty Army would shrink to the "smallest number since 1940, when the nation was gearing up to enter World War II." But Sensenbrenner didn’t say Hagel’s plan would result in the smallest Army since before the war buildup. He said it would be smaller than the pre-war troop complement. Before the U.S. buildup got cranked up, the Army had 188,000 troops in mid-1939 and 264,000 in mid-1940, official Army figures show. So Hagel’s plan for 440,000 active troops would still be larger than that, contrary to what Sensenbrenner said. Sensenbrenner’s phrasing looks better if you limit the comparison just to the 1941 period right before Pearl Harbor. But the troop numbers from 1941 include the U.S. buildup that began in 1940 in the wake of Germany’s 1939 invasion of Poland. By late August 1941, active-duty Army personnel totalled about 1.6 million. If Sensenbrenner was using 1.6 million as his comparison point, he couldn’t confine his outrage to the Obama/Hagel Army of 450,000, because every Army since 1952 has been smaller than 1.6 million. Troop levels ebb and flow, as you might expect, around major wars. After the World War II peak of 8.3 million, the Army’s numbers fell dramatically, then blipped up to 1.6 million during the Korean War. After another drop, the number ramped up to 1.475 million during the Vietnam War before levelling off at about 775,000 from the mid-1970s through the 1980s. The Army’s size fell significantly throughout the 1990s to 479,000 before slowly ticking up to 571,000 after the Sept. 11, 2001 terrorist attacks and the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. As America has drawn down troops in those nations, the Army’s strength has dropped to the current 520,000. So, with the proposed reduction, the Army would be just below where it was before the Sept. 11 attacks. Strained comparison There’s another angle to consider here: the difficulty in comparing a 1940 Army to today’s model. We asked military historian Lance Janda of Cameron University in Oklahoma to assess Sensenbrenner’s comments. Janda called the comments "terribly misleading, implying as they do a sort of similarity between the technology, force structure, threat environment, and federal budget reality in 2014 and the one in 1940 that simply does not exist." In terms of weapons systems, communications capabilities, speed of deployment, radius of action, and overall destructive potential, Janda said, the U.S. is light years beyond where it was prior to World War II. "In 1940 our Army and army Air Corps were relatively small and our Navy was one among several powerful navies around the world," Janda said. "Today, the United States Navy and Air Force have no peers." Travis Sharp, a fellow at the Center for a New American Security, a nonprofit think tank, wrote that size of the force often does matter, but "since the 2014 Army is not going to fight in the 1940 strategic environment, comparing them does not help us decide what to do today." "While interesting," Sharp wrote, "the comparison to 1940 is not particularly useful." "Today's Army is vastly more capable, even at a fraction of the headcount," John Pike, director of Globalsecurity.org, told us. Hagel, in announcing the budget reductions in February 2014, called them difficult and not without added risk. Hagel said the cuts assume the United States no longer becomes involved in large, prolonged stability operations overseas on the scale of Iraq and Afghanistan, the Defense Department reported. But he said the smaller force still would be capable of decisively defeating aggression in one major war "while also defending the homeland and supporting air and naval forces engaged in another theater against an adversary." Still, some analysts, including Sharp, have expressed concerns about repercussions on the battlefield and beyond if the active-duty complement falls to 440,000 without appropriate contingency planning. "Prioritizing technology over size has a strategic logic and conforms with historical practice," wrote Sharp. "Despite this logic, focusing on high-tech modernization without simultaneously implementing policies to regenerate ground forces quickly should a crisis erupt constitutes strategic negligence of the highest order." PolitiFact National checked a statement similar to Sensenbrenner’s in January 2012. The speaker was Mitt Romney. The Republican presidential candidate said that the U.S. military is at risk of losing its "military superiority" because "our Navy is smaller than it’s been since 1917. Our Air Force is smaller and older than any time since 1947." The claim earned a Pants on Fire rating. The numbers were close to accurate, but experts said it was wrong to assume a decline in the number of ships or aircraft automatically means a weaker military. And the comparison of today’s military to its predecessors in 1917 or 1947 was deemed ridiculous. Our rating Sensenbrenner said that President Obama’s budget proposed "an Army of fewer personnel than we had before Pearl Harbor." The congressman doesn’t read as much into the numbers as did Romney. But he flubbed the historical comparison pointed out by others, and experts say it’s a limited and potentially misleading comparison in any event. We rate the claim False.

pomt-08312	State House incumbent Jill Chambers, R-Atlanta, "personally profits from taxpayer money."	false	/georgia/statements/2010/oct/30/georgia-house-democratic-caucus-behalf-elena-paren/state-house-candidate-parent-said-incumbent-profit/	If you believe her foes, state House Rep. Jill Chambers is the candidate of your nightmares. Chambers "sold out our families," according to a mailer by Democrats on behalf of challenger Elena Parent. The Republican lets businesses "prey on consumers." But wait. There's more. "Even worse, Jill Chambers personally profits from taxpayer money," the mailer said. Profiting from taxpayer money? That claim begged for a fact check. District 81 is home to the Atlanta area's hardest-fought General Assembly race this season. Although the stretch of DeKalb County along Buford Highway leans toward Democrats, Chambers has managed to keep her seat since 2003. Parent, a political newcomer, could finally put the district in Democratic hands. The corporate attorney and former chief of staff for a state senator has strong backing and is not afraid of a fight. Mud is flying. Earlier this month, we checked out an attack by Chambers that accused Parent of taking money intended for the education of DeKalb children. We ruled that claim Pants on Fire. Now it's Parent's turn on the Truth-O-Meter. The Democrats' claim on her behalf that Chambers "profits" off of taxpayer money cites information from the General Assembly's Legislative Fiscal Office, which keeps track of member expenses. The mailer, received by The Atlanta Journal-Constitution Oct. 13, elaborates: "This year alone, Chambers billed taxpayers $9,000 for her expenses on days when the Legislature wasn't even in session ... If that wasn't enough, Chambers has charged taxpayers an additional $110,000 for her 'expenses' on top of her taxpayer-funded salary." Parent's camp said they did not pay for the ad and did not coordinate with state Democrats who wrote it. They referred us to Don Weigel, director of the Georgia House Democratic Caucus, for additional details. He said they're not accusing Chambers of fraud. "The point we're making is she is abusing the system," Weigel said. In addition to an annual salary of about $17,300, state law entitles members of the General Assembly to a per diem and mileage for their services. Most receive $173 per day plus 50 cents per mile. This money is for session days and out-of-session committee work. Chambers chairs the MARTA Oversight Committee, which oversees spending for the transit agency. She is also assigned to the Appropriations, Rules and Governmental Affairs committees. The Democrats' argument goes like this: The business Chambers ran with her now ex-husband selling art supplies to interior designers faltered in recent years and closed. She filed for bankruptcy earlier this month. According to Parent's camp, as Chambers struggled financially, the number of days she said she performed out-of-session committee work jumped from 17 in 2008 to to 43 in 2009, even though the full MARTOC committee met only a few times in 2009. Weigel said Chambers could have exaggerated the amount of work she performed to get more money. A document Democrats sent AJC PolitiFact Georgia laying out their argument said that they were unable to get the Legislature to produce records that say "what, if any" services she performed for the state. AJC PolitiFact Georgia came up with expense records stretching back eight years. To receive a per diem for out-of session committee work, legislators must file a voucher that names the committee and lists the dates of service and miles driven. To receive reimbursements for costs such as stipends for legislative aides, yearly parking at the Capitol, printing and post office boxes, legislators must submit vouchers and proof of payment. We took a look at those vouchers and receipts and compared them to figures Democrats provided us on Chambers' expenses. We will take the mailer's points one at a time: Chambers billed taxpayers $9,000 for her expenses on days when the Legislature wasn't in session This statement is misleading. So far this year, Chambers' actual expenses total $3,324.95. This is less than half the $7,000 that state law allows. She paid the money out of pocket and was reimbursed after the state received proof of payment. Chambers also reported she performed 42 days of committee work out of session for a total of $7,266 in per diem payments and $743.40 in mileage. This means that Chambers did receive money for days the Legislature was not in session. But so long as she did the work, state law says she is legally entitled to the money. We found no evidence that the number of days she reported was alarmingly high, or that she failed to perform a claimed day's work. A 2003 AJC investigation into per diem days found it was unusual for legislators to claim more than 50 days after the end of the legislative session. Chambers' 42 days included days of out-of session committee work during spring session breaks. According to that 2003 investigation, that year's MARTOC committee chair claimed he worked 99 days after the spring session. Chambers charged taxpayers $110,000 for her expenses on top of her salary This statement is even more misleading than the first. The paragraph that includes this sentence begins with the words "this year alone." Therefore a reader might easily think that Chambers billed the state $110,000 for a single year's expenses. A closer look at Democrats' data shows the $110,000 is a total for about eight years of service in the Legislature, not one. And the money was not solely for expenses such as legislative aide work or office furniture. It was the entire amount she had received from the state in per diem, mileage and expense reimbursements. Once again, state law entitles her to the money, so long as she does the work and makes real payments. We took a closer look at some of Chambers' vouchers. They included work while the Legislature was on break during session, and duties for committees other than MARTOC such as Appropriations and Rules. So even though the full MARTOC committee met only a few times out of session, Chambers was involved in other committees that also met. And contrary to Democrats' claims, Chambers' per diem days did not post an unusual jump during her financial difficulties. Their 2010 numbers excluded vouchers she filed after April 19. According to Oct. 21 Fiscal Office records, Chambers has worked 42 days outside of session this year -- one day less than in 2009. Since Chambers began as MARTOC chair in 2005, her days have typically hovered between 32 and 43, although they dipped in 2008 to 17. This means Chambers would have actually received less money when she needed it most. Given this information, the accusation that Chambers "profits" from taxpayer money is out of bounds. As Parent is a former chief of staff to a state senator, she and her camp should have known better. At AJC PolitiFact, the burden of proof rests on the accuser. Democrats have not proved Chambers exaggerated the amount of work she performed. Furthermore, the accusations are misleading. Parent's backers suggest Chambers is wasteful or dodging the rules. But her actual reported expenses in recent years have been less than half of what is allowed by law. Her per diem is set by state statute, and the days she claimed dropped when she could have used the cash. Given the flimsy backing to the claim, by the Parent camp's rules, you could say any legislator "profits" from her work if she claims per diem and mileage. We therefore rule this claim False.

pomt-09615	During his tenure as mayor, he "saw Houston’s crime rates drop to the lowest levels in more than 25 years."	true	/texas/statements/2010/jan/13/bill-white/white-says-crime-hit-25-year-low-during-his-tenure/	As his campaign revs up, Democratic gubernatorial candidate Bill White is pointing voters to his record as mayor of Houston from 2004 through 2009. On his campaign Web site and in a thank-you letter published Jan. 2 in the Houston Chronicle, he brags about the city’s crime rates. Though White in his public statements has stopped short of claiming he reduced crime in the nation's fourth-largest city, his Web site biography notes that during his tenure as mayor, he "saw Houston’s crime rates drop to the lowest levels in more than 25 years." White's critics have accused him of being soft on crime, and the issue is likely to emerge in the governor's race. We decided to investigate whether White's statement about the decrease in Houston crime was true. Statistics provided by his campaign confirm that the crime rate overall hit a 25-year low during his administration. That measure includes three nonviolent property crimes (such as burglary) as well as four major violent crimes (murder, rape, robbery and aggravated assault). The White campaign's numbers, which were generated by the Houston Police Department for the years 1980 through 2008, show that the city’s 2008 total crime rate -- 6,080 offenses per 100,000 residents -- was the lowest of any of those years. In fact, 2006, 2007 and 2008 had the three lowest total crime rates in the 29 years of data offered by the campaign. To double-check the numbers, we compared White’s statistics with those of the Texas Department of Public Safety, which collects data from local law enforcement agencies for the FBI’s Uniform Crime Reporting program. The DPS numbers for Houston did not perfectly match the police department’s because the agencies use different population estimates in their calculations. However, the discrepancies were small and did not undermine White’s assertion: In the DPS data starting with 1980, 2008 was also the year with the lowest total crime rate: 6,053.7 offenses per 100,000 residents. Looking only at violent crime in Houston, the picture changes somewhat. There was at least one year -- 1998 being the most recent -- when the violent crime rate was lower than any year during White's tenure. And both the White campaign and Clete Snell, chairman of the Criminal Justice Department at the University of Houston Downtown, note that Houston experienced an uptick in violent crime in 2005, White’s second year in office, that they attribute to the influx of Hurricane Katrina evacuees. These days, few public officials can legitimately take credit for reducing crime locally. That's because crime rates have been trending down all across the country for years, in some cases to record lows. According to FBI data, the nation's total crime rate in 2008 was down 29 percent from 1983, 25 years earlier. Experts don't agree on the reasons for the persistent trend, but have suggested such factors as rising incarceration rates, the aging of the population and improved police practices. It is important to note that crime trends do not follow straight lines — they can fluctuate year-to-year. Still, according to the DPS data, total crime in Houston has dropped 31 percent since 1983. And the decline was under way before White took office. Nevertheless, when the Houston FBI office gave White the FBI Director’s 2007 Community Leadership Award, his efforts to combat crime were among the reasons cited. "Mayor White is being recognized for his outstanding contributions toward improving the quality of life in the City of Houston through his commitment to law enforcement and the prevention of crime," a statement from the FBI said. Summing up: Although experts debate the reasons for the downward trend in crime nationwide, White is right that the total crime rate in Houston hit a 25-year low during his time as mayor. We give him a True.	None	Bill White	None	None	None	2010-01-13T16:38:18	2009-12-28	['Houston']

pomt-10196	Holding up a BlackBerry, McCain campaign adviser says, "you’re looking at the miracle John McCain helped create."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/sep/17/douglas-holtz-eakin/the-wireless-revolution-would-have-come-anyway/	Considering Sen. John McCain’s admissions that he is computer “illiterate,” that he has only recently begun to learn how to surf the Net and that he never e-mails, the comment (joke?) from one of his chief advisers made for some snarky blogosphere chatter. A reporter on Sept. 16 asked McCain’s top economic adviser what McCain did as chairman of the Senate Commerce Committee that helped him understand financial markets. “He did this,” said Douglas Holtz-Eakin, holding up his BlackBerry, the ubiquitous handheld wireless device that serves as a mobile phone but also allows users to e-mail, text message and browse the Web. “Telecommunications of the United States is a premier innovation in the past 15 years, comes right through the Commerce Committee so you’re looking at the miracle John McCain helped create and that’s what he did.” Was he saying McCain invented the Blackberry, or merely helped clear away government hurdles to innovation that allowed for Blackberry-like ideas to flourish? It didn’t take long for the political blogs to reach their own conclusion on that question and snort with Al Gore-invented-the-Internet references. The Obama campaign gleefully piled on as well. “If John McCain hadn’t said that ‘the fundamentals of our economy are strong’ on the day of one of our nation’s worst financial crises, the claim that he invented the BlackBerry would have been the most preposterous thing said all week,” said Obama campaign spokesman Bill Burton. Even McCain laughed when told of Holtz-Eakin’s comment, according to senior aide Matt McDonald. “He would not claim to be the inventor of anything, much less the BlackBerry. This was obviously a boneheaded joke by a staffer,” McDonald said. For the record, Gore never actually claimed to have invented the Internet either. We’re just not going to take seriously any suggestion that McCain actually helped create the BlackBerry. It’s absurd. The BlackBerry was developed by a Canadian company, Research in Motion, and released in 2002. But there is a real issue here, and that’s what McCain did, or did not do, as chairman of the Senate Commerce Committee that might be said to have fostered the growth of the wireless industry. McCain served as chairman of the committee from 1997 to 2001 and again from 2003 to 2005. According to an AP account of his remarks, Holtz-Eakin said McCain’s handling of regulation and deregulation of the telecommunications industry in particular left him with the skills to help revive the economy amid a mortgage crisis, an energy crisis and a Wall Street meltdown. By far the most important piece of legislation that emerged from McCain’s tenure on the Commerce Committee was the landmark Telecommunications Act of 1996, the first major overhaul of telecommunications laws since the New Deal. "The goal of this new law," according to an FCC Web site, "is to let anyone enter any communications business – to let any communications business compete in any market against any other." The act became law a year before McCain was chairman of the committee, though he was a member. And McCain opposed it and voted against it, arguing that it didn’t go far enough to deregulate the industry. As a result, he argued, it would not create the promised competition and lower prices to consumers. As far as the wireless industry is concerned, perhaps the other most significant government decision was to begin auctioning the airwaves to allow companies to spread wireless communications networks for telephones and computers around the country. Those auctions began in 1994. Again, McCain wasn’t yet the chairman, and he was not the major player driving the auctions. In fact, he voted against the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993 that included provisions for the wireless spectrum auctions. The Commerce Committee oversees a wide array of interests: everything from the Coast Guard to communications to interstate commerce; science, engineering, and technology research and development; sports; transportation; and regulation of interstate common carriers, including railroads, buses, trucks, vessels, pipelines and civil aviation. The McCain campaign didn't respond to requests from PolitiFact for details on McCain's role in telecommunications and wireless issues. A February 2000 story in the Christian Science Monitor concluded that as for legislative accomplishments as chairman of the Senate Commerce Committee, "McCain has chalked up an average list of achievements. "Recently, for example, he has shepherded through bills to limit liability to companies from Y2K-related lawsuits, improve truck and bus safety, protect the privacy of children online, place a moratorium on Internet taxes, and designate a universal 911 emergency number." In 2004, McCain made headlines when, as chairman of the Commerce Committee, he pushed for stricter steroids policies in professional sports. McCain's appetite for deregulation has by and large made him a friend of the telecommunications industry (witness his campaign contributions), but the wireless revolution largely emerged on its own. Congress acted mainly to regulate or deregulate it, and to sell the airwaves as a public asset. For a chief policy adviser to hold up a BlackBerry and suggest McCain was a major player in fostering its development – even from a regulatory perspective – is more than a stretch.

pomt-12749	Says Scott Walker is proposing to add 485 employees "in the category of supervisor and management" to his Department of Administration.	mostly true	/wisconsin/statements/2017/mar/01/kathleen-vinehout/scott-walker-wants-add-485-positions-management-ca/	Wisconsin Democrat Kathleen Vinehout, who is considering a run for governor in 2018, is sounding alarm bells about the state budget proposed by Republican Gov. Scott Walker -- who appears to be preparing to run for a third term. In a Feb. 20, 2017 interview, the state senator from Alma was asked by Wisconsin Public Radio talk show host Joy Cardin about a column she had written about Walker’s 2017-’19 spending plan, which was released a couple of weeks earlier. The column highlighted what Vinehout -- who ran unsuccessfully for the Democratic nomination to run against Walker in the 2012 gubernatorial recall election -- described as little known details about the budget. Cardin wanted to know why there would be a large increase in the number of people working for the Department of Administration. That’s a department, whose secretary is appointed by Walker, that works closely with the governor’s office. Vinehout replied by saying 485 positions would be added to the department "in the category of supervisor and management," although in many cases, they would be people transferred from other departments. "It really kind of takes the whole heart of state government -- especially as money flows in and out of agencies, and puts it into the Department of Administration," she added. Leaving aside Vinehout’s view of the impact of the move, let’s check whether Walker is proposing to add 485 positions "in the category of supervisor and management" to his Department of Administration. The numbers The major functions of the Department of Administration include helping the governor develop and implement the state budget and supporting other state agencies with centralized purchasing and financial management. The department also coordinates telecommunications, energy, and land use planning and community development, and it regulates racing, charitable gaming and Indian gaming. Walker’s budget, which must be approved by the Legislature, would increase the department’s positions in both years of the budget. The new total for the department would be 1,149 positions -- an increase of 485. And those positions are listed under the heading of "supervision and management." But Bob Lang, director of the nonpartisan state Legislative Fiscal Bureau, gave us some context about the 485: The majority of positions are held by existing employees who work for other agencies; these are not new state government positions. The majority would continue to physically work in those agencies, such as the Department of Natural Resources, but would become employees of the Department of Administration. Despite the designation in the budget document as "supervision and management," the vast majority would not be supervisors or managers -- rather they are involved in the supervision and management of human resource activities such as employee recruitment and assistance, training, and payroll and benefits. Walker says the primary aim is to "assign various administrative functions to a single entity, allowing individual agencies to focus on their core business missions and avoid redundant efforts on services that can be offered most effectively from a central entity." But it’s also true that if the Legislature goes along with Walker’s plan, those employees would be more directly under his control. Our rating In sounding alarms about Walker’s budget, Vinehout says the governor is proposing to add 485 positions "in the category of supervisor and management" to his Department of Administration. Vinehout is correct on the number and, technically, they are "in the category" of supervisor and management. But while they are involved in the supervision and management of human resource activities, the vast majority are not actually in supervisory or management positions.

pomt-11160	"Since 2015, the City of Milwaukee has spent more than $22 million on settlements with litigants accusing police of misconduct."	mostly true	/wisconsin/statements/2018/may/24/bob-donovan/has-milwaukee-where-police-tased-nbas-sterling-bro/	By the evening of May 23, 2018, a newly released video -- showing the arrest and tasing of NBA basketball player Sterling Brown by Milwaukee police -- was going viral. The incident occurred Jan. 26, 2018, when Brown drew police attention by parking across two handicapped spaces outside a Walgreens about 2 a.m. The police bodycam footage showed officers had been confrontational from the start of their interaction with the Milwaukee Bucks rookie, who was thrown to the pavement and tased. As the video was being released, the Milwaukee police chief apologized to Brown, a 23-year-old African-American, and said officers had been disciplined. Brown has hired a prominent Wisconsin lawyer to bring a civil rights lawsuit against the City of Milwaukee. That raises the possibility of taxpayers having to pay for the police actions and made us wonder about an alderman’s statement made in connection with the incident: Has the City of Milwaukee paid, since 2015, more than $22 million to settle police misconduct lawsuits? Statement by an alderman The incident with Brown never sat well with Milwaukee Ald. Bob Donovan, who represents the south side neighborhood where it occurred -- but not necessarily because of how Brown was treated. Days after the incident, Donovan accused Mayor Tom Barrett, a frequent political rival, of having "ordered" that Brown not be charged with a crime -- allegations Barrett strongly denied. (Brown had been arrested on a tentative misdemeanor charge of resisting or obstructing an officer. But ultimately police decided not to request criminal charges be filed.) Now back to the release of the videotape. It had been reported two days before the release of the video when it would be released. Several hours before the release, Donovan issued a news release that didn’t mention Brown, but seemed to allude to him. The release carried this headline: "Has policing in urban America become an undoable job?" Donovan, who is known as strongly pro-police, lamented a lack of respect for officers, saying: "And there’s another thing that I just don’t get: Why someone would refuse to obey a lawful order given by a police officer." Just before using the Taser, which emits an electrical shock, on Brown, officers had told him to remove his hands from his pockets. Brown, who had taken his hands in and out of his pockets several times before that, replied: "Hold on. I've got stuff in my hands." The Donovan statement from the news release that we want to check is this: "Since 2015, the City of Milwaukee has spent more than $22 million on settlements with litigants accusing police of misconduct." The figures In October 2017, seven months before Donovan made his claim, the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel reported: Police misconduct has cost Milwaukee taxpayers at least $17.5 million in legal settlements since 2015, forcing the city to borrow money to make the payouts amid an ever-tightening budget. That amount jumps to at least $21.4 million when interest paid on the borrowing and fees paid to outside attorneys are factored in, a Milwaukee Journal Sentinel analysis found. At the time, the city was considering whether to close six fire stations, leading Ald. Bob Bauman to say: "Just have the police stop violating civil rights, and we’d have plenty of money for fire houses." So, the $21.4 million is close to Donovan’s claim of more than $22 million. Official tally: $20.2 million When we asked Donovan the source for his statement, he provided us a May 3, 2018, memo from the city’s nonpartisan Legislative Reference Bureau. The memo says that since 2015, the city has paid $20.2 million to settle police misconduct lawsuits or claims against the city, including four that exceeded $2 million: Case Amount Chaunte Ott, wrongfully convicted of 1995 homicide $6.5 million 74 African-Americans subject to strip, body cavity searches $5 million Woman raped by officer after he responded to her 911 call $2.5 million Dontre Hamilton shot to death by officer in a park $2.3 million But more pending The memo goes on to say that the total is $22.1 million if a pending settlement of $1.9 million in a stop-and-frisk lawsuit brought by the American Civil Liberties Union is included. On May 8, 2018, a Common Council committee postponed a vote to recommend approving the settlement when aldermen were told the estimated settlement could be much higher -- some $6 million. So, that settlement has not been finalized. Our rating Donovan says: "Since 2015, the City of Milwaukee has spent more than $22 million on settlements with litigants accusing police of misconduct." The city’s nonpartisan Legislative Reference Bureau puts the tally at $20.2 million, but notes that a pending settlement in one case would push the total to $22.1 million.
