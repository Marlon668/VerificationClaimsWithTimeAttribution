Sean Duffy (R-Wausau) wants states to be able to refuse Medicaid funds to health centers that provide abortions, so in January 2017, the Wisconsin Republican reintroduced legislation to do just that — a bill called the Women’s Public Health and Safety Act. Federal dollars currently cannot go toward abortions, except in cases of rape, incest or risk to the mother’s life. But providers that offer abortions can still receive Medicaid dollars for other medical services, such as tests for sexually transmitted diseases and cancer screenings. In a Jan. 24, 2017 news release announcing the legislation, Duffy claimed: "New evidence reveals that abortion providers like Planned Parenthood do little other than provide abortions." It’s an intriguing statement: The bill hits on a divisive issue in American politics — abortion — and Duffy’s news release provided no supporting information to back-up the claim. When we asked Duffy for details, spokesman Mark Bednar cited a video that an anti-abortion group released in January 2017 asserting, in short, that few Planned Parenthood facilities offer prenatal care. (Planned Parenthood, which has about 650 health centers across the country, including 21 in Wisconsin, disputes the video’s conclusions.) Bednar also provided estimates of Planned Parenthood's U.S. market share for abortions and how much money the group makes by performing abortions. We reviewed everything Duffy’s team supplied and none of it came close to justifying the claim that "new evidence reveals that abortion providers like Planned Parenthood do little other than provide abortions." So let’s take a closer look. Calculating abortions At the outset, we note that Planned Parenthood provides a wide variety of health services, not just abortions, according to the group’s 2014-2015 annual report, the most recent one available. Those other services include contraception, hormone therapy, testing and treatment for sexually transmitted diseases, pregnancy tests, cancer screenings and prevention procedures, as well as smoking cessation assistance. To fully evaluate Duffy’s claim, though, we need to get a sense of the relative frequency of the abortions Planned Parenthood provides and how it compares to other services, and there are different ways of measuring that. Planned Parenthood performed nearly 324,000 abortions in the 12-month period between October 2013 and September 2014, according to the group’s annual report. That’s out of a total 9.4 million services provided to patients in the same time period, including: -- 4.2 million tests and treatment procedures for sexually transmitted infections; -- 2.9 million contraception services; -- 1.1 million pregnancy tests; -- 682,000 cancer screening and prevention procedures; -- 95,800 other health-related services; -- 17,400 prenatal services. The upshot is that abortions accounted for about 3 percent of all Planned Parenthood’s procedures and services, the annual report states. Critics and some observers have questioned whether the 3 percent figure accurately reflects the proportion of abortion services at Planned Parenthood centers. That’s because the calculation used to arrive at the number doesn’t distinguish between types of services, their cost or complexity. In other words, one abortion is counted the same as providing a contraceptive or pregnancy test. But there is a second, perhaps more objective way of assessing Duffy’s claim: look at patients. Planned Parenthood had about 2.5 million patients in the 12-month period covered in its annual report, from October 2013 to September 2014. About 13 percent of patients had abortions in that time frame, according to Elizabeth Clark, director of health media for Planned Parenthood Federation of America. Put another way: 87 percent of patients visited Planned Parenthood for non-abortion needs. We recognize, of course, that Planned Parenthood has self-reported these figures from their affiliates. Still, the numbers are independently audited, Clark said, and we are not aware of any other sources that can reliably provide the same kind of information. It’s also worth pointing out that because federal dollars generally can’t be used for abortions, Duffy’s bill and other legislation aimed at restricting public funding for Planned Parenthood are themselves an acknowledgment of sorts that the organization does more than provide abortions. Indeed, Planned Parenthood’s single-largest share of revenue in fiscal year 2015 — $553 million, or 43 percent — came from government grants and reimbursements, according to the annual report. Our rating Duffy said, "New evidence reveals that abortion providers like Planned Parenthood do little other than provide abortions." But that is far from accurate. Planned Parenthood’s most recent annual report covering a 12-month span between October 2013 and September 2014 states that abortions accounted for 3 percent of services the organization provided. About 13 percent of Planned Parenthood patients had abortions in the same period, a spokeswoman said. What’s more, Duffy’s own measure to defund Planned Parenthood underlines how inaccurate this claim is. Federal money generally can’t be used for abortions, so the money he and others want to eliminate goes to pay for, well, things other than abortions. For a claim that’s false and ridiculous, we have one rating: Pants on Fire.

pomt-05053	"I've never supported a payroll tax."	false	/texas/statements/2012/jul/09/david-dewhurst/david-dewhurst-says-he-never-supported-texas-payro/	Questioning his opponent for the state's Republican U.S. Senate nomination, attorney Ted Cruz asked David Dewhurst: "Did you support a payroll tax -- yes or no -- and is that a good idea?" "No and no," Dewhurst replied in their June 22, 2012, debate hosted by Dallas’s KERA-TV, Channel 13. Cruz: "You did not support a payroll tax?" Dewhurst: "No, I’ve never supported a wage tax and I’ve never supported a payroll tax." We previously rated Pants on Fire a claim by Cruz that Dewhurst has a record of promoting a Texas income tax. No Texas leader has come close to such a pitch since a Dewhurst predecessor as lieutenant governor, Democrat Bob Bullock, floated the prospect in 1991. And is Dewhurst correct that he has never supported a payroll tax? Everyone is familiar with the federal payroll tax, meaning the taxes taken from paychecks of employed Americans, primarily to fund Social Security and Medicare. But Texas has no state payroll tax. End of story? No, because a payroll tax feature was debated in Texas in 2004 and 2005, when Dewhurst was in his first gavel-wielding term overseeing the Texas Senate. At the time, lawmakers were looking at ways of revising the state’s outdated business franchise tax and also generating revenue to cover sought reductions in school property taxes. According to news stories we corraled via Nexis, Dewhurst steered clear of supporting a payroll tax during a spring 2004 special session called by Gov. Rick Perry toward tackling the franchise tax and lowering school property taxes. The Texas House removed a payroll tax element from its proposal before sending its revised plan to the Senate, which advanced no counter-proposal before the session ended, according to a May 18, 2004, Houston Chronicle news article. The next year, lawmakers tried again. As the 2005 regular legislative session began, Dewhurst joined Perry and House Speaker Tom Craddick in vowing to lower school property taxes. The trio did not commit to a particular finance plan, according to a Jan. 11, 2005, Austin American-Statesman news article, though; the story says Perry "reaffirmed his opposition to a payroll tax and questioned whether an increased gross-receipts tax or business-activity tax could jeopardize job growth." A Jan. 18, 2005, San Antonio Express-News report says that two days into the 140-day session, a Senate plan presented by Dewhurst called for expanding the franchise tax to all businesses except sole proprietorships. The story says senators had discussed setting the rate at less than 2 percent of each firm's net income plus its payroll, minus a deduction for each employee. So, the initial Senate plan of 2005 had a payroll element. In March 2005, the House approved a revenue package that offered companies a choice of paying the existing franchise tax or a 1.15 percent payroll tax on salaries up to $90,000 a year. Dewhurst aired misgivings about the House’s payroll element, according to a March 16, 2005, Express-News news article. The story quotes Dewhurst saying: "I've said over and over and over again that I think a broad-based, low rate that's based upon revenue and income is fairer than a payroll tax" which hurts firms with lots of workers. The story says House leaders had said they got around that difficulty by offering companies a choice of which type of tax to pay. An April 28, 2005, Dallas Morning News news article, headlined "Dewhurst lays out tax swap," says Dewhurst had "laid out a preliminary tax swap plan" offsetting some $4.5 billion in school property tax reductions with various tax increases including a revamped franchise tax extended to virtually all businesses, which would pay about 1.35 percent on after-tax earnings plus, the story says, employee compensation. But by May 2005, the Senate voted to answer the House with a plan allowing companies to choose the lower of two business taxes, as long as they generated more money than a minimum tax of 0.25 percent of gross receipts -- and the adopted plan retained payroll elements. The details are a bit eye-glazing. But as described in a May 12, 2005, American-Statesman news article, the first option for businesses was to pay 2.5 percent of the sum of their net taxable income plus payroll, though they could deduct from the tax base either half of their payrolls or $30,000 per employee plus the cost of some health benefits. The second option in the Senate plan would have required companies to pay a 1.75 percent payroll tax, capped at $1,500 per employee. After the Senate acted, Dewhurst issued a press release praising the action, as Cruz’s campaign has pointed out. Dewhurst’s release includes a paragraph summarizing the tax measure, House Bill 3. "By closing loopholes, the plan broadens the franchise tax base, and extends a lower rate to all Texas businesses—effectively treating all businesses equally under state tax law. Texas businesses will have a choice of paying either a low-rate revised franchise tax or a payroll tax," the release says. In that session and a summer session, however, the House and Senate did not reach a compromise, leaving the overhaul of the franchise tax to be resolved in a different way in 2006. For outside perspective, we shared the description of the 2005 Senate-approved plan with Richard Pomp, a University of Connecticut law professor who has written extensively on state and local taxation. By telephone, Pomp said he would say the first option in the Senate plan had a payroll tax element, while the second option was a pure payroll tax. "It doesn’t get any less ambiguous than that, does it?" Pomp said. We contacted Dewhurst’s campaign about this topic and didn’t hear back. Our ruling During the state’s mid-decade tax debates, the Senate under Dewhurst’s leadership -- and to his praise -- incorporated payroll taxes in a proposal to replace the existing business franchise tax. No payroll tax passed into law. Still, it’s incorrect to say Dewhurst never supported a payroll tax. We rate his debate claim as False.

pomt-01151	The home-mortgage deduction is widely thought to be "a middle-class benefit. It's not -- 73 percent of it goes to people making a quarter-million dollars or more a year."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2014/dec/17/tom-coburn/coburn-says-73-percent-benefits-mortgage-deduction/	Not long before he was to officially retire from the U.S. Senate, Oklahoma Republican Tom Coburn appeared on CNN to discuss the Senate’s report on alleged CIA torture of detainees. But the Dec. 11, 2014, interview, eventually turned to an issue Coburn is better known for -- cutting government spending. Coburn aimed his comments at tax breaks given to people who, he suggested, don’t really need them. "We're going to spend $5 trillion over the next five years in terms of tax benefits to selected groups of people that may not necessarily be (helpful in) growing and creating new jobs," Coburn said. He continued, "Home mortgages -- everybody said that's a middle-class benefit. It's not -- 73 percent of it goes to people making a quarter-million dollars or more a year. So, that's not middle class. That's upper class." We wondered if Coburn’s numbers were accurate, so we took a closer look. Pretty quickly, we were able to find where the 73 percent figure came from. It stems from a report by the Congressional Budget Office, the nonpartisan number-crunching arm of Congress. The May 2013 report attempts to classify which classes of Americans benefit from "tax expenditures." What’s a "tax expenditure"? It’s Washington jargon for a preference written into the federal tax system -- basically, a tax break -- that reduces the amount of revenue the government brings in. Typically, such tax breaks provide financial assistance to identifiable groups of people -- homeowners, in the case of the mortgage-interest deduction. The provision in question allows homeowners to deduct the amount of the mortgage interest they paid during the year when figuring out how much they need to pay in federal taxes. Coburn’s concern was that the deduction disproportionately benefits richer homeowners, rather than middle-class homeowners. It would seem to make sense that richer homeowners would benefit from this deduction more than less-well-heeled homeowners would, if only because the richer you are, the more expensive your house will likely be, and, therefore, the more you will tend to pay in interest. But Coburn’s statistic inflates the degree by which the richest Americans benefit from the tax break. CBO found that 73 percent of the benefits from the mortgage-interest deduction went to the top quintile of Americans, as measured by their pre-tax income. ("Quintile" refers to the top one-fifth of the income spectrum.) The CBO report doesn’t specify the income cutoff to make it into the top quintile. But other data shows that it’s well below the $250,000 Coburn cited. Census Bureau figures for 2012 found that only 2.4 percent of American households earned at least $250,000. This suggests that the top quintile starts somewhere between $100,000 and $125,000. That estimate is backed up by calculations from the Urban Institute-Brookings Institution Tax Policy Center, which found that the top quintile starts at a little over $100,000. Even more persuasively, the Tax Policy Center looked at the exact question Coburn raised. The center didn’t specifically break out incomes above $250,000, but it found that those with incomes above $200,000 took 45.2 percent of the benefits from the deduction. That means that those earning $250,000 would be taking somewhere between 35 percent and 40 percent of the benefits. Thirty-five to 40 percent is certainly a disproportionate share -- those earning $200,000 or more accounted for just 6.3 percent of all taxpayers -- but it’s still only about half of Coburn’s 73 percent share. Coburn "is way off," said Roberton Williams, a fellow at the Tax Policy Center. Coburn’s office clarified the discrepancy by saying that he had been referring to CBO’s average household income for the top quintile in 2011. That was $234,700, or within shouting distance of a quarter million dollars. However, the $234,000 figure is the average income of all households in the top quintile, meaning that many of the households in that grouping earned less than that. We believe the lower figure -- the top-quintile entry threshold of a little over $100,000 -- more accurately reflects the point Coburn was making. Our ruling Coburn said 73 percent of the benefits of the mortgage-interest deduction "goes to people making a quarter-million dollars or more a year." In reality, 73 percent of the mortgage-interest deduction benefits go to those making a little over $100,000 a year, not $250,000 a year. That’s still a large amount of the benefit going to a relatively high-income group, but it’s not as high as Coburn indicated. In reality, 73 percent of the benefits are sent to the top-earning 20 percent of taxpayers, rather than to top 5 percent, as Coburn suggested. We rate the claim Half True.

pomt-14617	"It is rare that a retirement grade determination is conducted for an officer previously retired from the U.S. armed forces."	true	/rhode-island/statements/2016/jan/31/jack-reed/reed-and-mccain-make-case-save-gen-petraeus-pensio/	From their seats on the Senate Armed Services Committee, Jack Reed and John McCain had a front row vantage point on the rise of Army General David Petraeus, the legendary military leader who authored the counterinsurgency campaign known as "The Surge." Both senators visited Petraeus in Baghdad, received testimony from him in Washington and greatly admired the general’s leadership of U.S. troops in Iraq and Afghanistan. Reed and McCain, former military officers and the Republican and Democratic leaders of the committee, repeatedly voted for Petraeus’ various postings, including his appointment as director of the Central Intelligence Agency in 2011. Then in 2012 the roof collapsed on Petraeus’ career after a scandal involving an extra-marital affair with his biographer, Paula Broadwell, prompted his resignation in 2012 and eventually led to his misdemeanor criminal conviction for inappropriately handling classified information. Now, in a letter to Defense Secretary Ashton Carter, the two senators have come to the defense of the disgraced four-star general, whom they called "brilliant." Carter is considering retroactively demoting the retiree, which could take away one of his stars and slash his annual pension from about $220,000 to as low as $170,000, according to recent media reports. The senators’ Jan. 20 letter says a retroactive review of Petraeus’ retirement, coming one year after the general admitted his guilt and apologized, would be "manifestly unreasonable and unfair." "It is rare that a retirement grade determination is conducted for an officer previously retired from the U.S. armed forces," says the letter, which is signed by both senators. The statement made us wonder, is it rare? Petraeus can’t be the only former military officer convicted of a crime. What happens in other cases? First, let’s look at the Petraeus case. After returning from Afghanistan during the summer of 2011, Petraeus held onto eight black notebooks that contained classified information such as the names of covert officers, war strategy and other intelligence matters, according to an admission he made at his plea hearing. "On or about" Aug. 28, 2011, says the court record, Petraeus provided the notebooks to his biographer. He retired on Aug. 31, and he retrieved the notebooks on or about Sept. 1. Later, in October 2012, while Petraeus was serving as CIA director, he spoke to two FBI agents and admitted his involvement in an affair with Broadwell, telling them their relationship began after he left the military. He denied providing classified information to Broadwell, which was a knowing and deliberate false statement, according to an admission he would make later in court. In November 2012, he resigned as CIA director. FBI agents recovered the notebooks from Petraeus’ home, where he had kept them in violation of the law. In March 2015, he pleaded guilty to the misdemeanor. In the U.S. Army, a process called grade determination" governs the rank an officer retires at and also affects retirement pay. Such determinations "are normally accomplished at the time of retirement" and remain "fixed" thereafter, according to Army regulation 15-80. But the Army can lower the grade of a retired officer if any misconduct while on active duty is documented by a conviction in the wake of the officer’s retirement, says the regulation, which also talks about "substantial new evidence" triggering a review if it’s "discovered within a short time following separation." Reed and McCain argue that too much time has passed for such action. The specific sequence of events that might lead the Army to retroactively demote a retiree are quite rare to begin with, according to Anita Gorecki-Robbins, a lawyer and former Army Judge Advocate General officer who represents members of the military in grade determination proceedings. First of all, she said, the officer’s active-duty misconduct -- or lawbreaking -- must stay off the radar prior to his or her retirement. Then after retirement someone must tell the Army’s review board about it. During her 15 years of experience, she’s never encountered such a case. We asked both senators to substantiate their claim that such retroactive grade determinations are rare. Reed’s spokesman, Chip Unruh, consulted the Department of Defense and the Army and told us both entities confirm there has been only one case in the last decade involving the retroactive demotion of a retired three star or four star general. Looking at the officers’ corps at large, it’s rare for anyone to advance to the rank of three-star general and it’s rarer still for an officer of such a lofty rank to be criminally charged. And then consider the circumstances of the Petraeus scandal, involving a storied war leader and former CIA director. As Gorecki-Robbins says: "This is truly a unique set of facts." Our Ruling In their letter, McCain and Reed told the defense secretary, "It is rare that a retirement grade determination is conducted for an officer previously retired from the U.S. armed forces." That claim is True. That’s our ruling. But we feel compelled to point out that the procedure itself is rare and it’s rarer still to see an American military officer rise so high and fall so far.

pomt-07205	"We had (a bill) in Florida where we now are prohibiting doctors to talk -- particularly pediatricians -- to talk to their patients about gun safety in the home."	mostly false	/florida/statements/2011/jun/06/bob-graham/bob-graham-says-hardball-florida-bill-prohibits-do/	Former Florida Democratic governor and U.S. Senator Bob Graham says current Gov. Rick Scott is upending years of progress in the state created by both Republicans and Democrats, and his abysmal poll numbers are evidence that Floridians don't like it. Appearing on MSNBC's Hardball program on June 1, 2011, Graham said Scott is "out of the mainstream of Florida." (Scott's current approval rating is 29 percent, according to a Quinnipiac University poll.) "Remember, Florida has had Republican governors for the last 12 years. We have had Republican Legislatures for most of that time. And now we have a supermajority Republican Legislature," said Graham, who appeared on the show with former Ohio Gov. Ted Strickland, also a Democrat. "So when the governor vetoes a budget and describes -- or line-item vetoes -- and describes things as frivolous and not in the public interest, he is not pointing at Democrats. He is pointing at his own party." "What happened with these Republicans?" Matthews asked. "People wanted to see some restraint on spending. They're worried about the economy. And these guys went in there and picked up on the old Republican agenda of labor bashing, of going after public employees -- I guess they are going after the trial lawyers next -- just the old Republican agenda that they could have done (in) any administration, and they are just out of touch with the people. What do you think, Governor Graham?" Graham answered. "Chris, I think you are absolutely right that what the people are really concerned with today are jobs and those things that are going to contribute to long-term economic well-being, such as an investment in education, protecting our environment," he said. "And these governors have gotten off onto a very bizarre agenda of issues. We had one in Florida where we now are prohibiting doctors to talk -- particularly pediatricians -- to talk to their patients about gun safety in the home. That's how far out of the mainstream our state government has gotten." The talk about a gun bill passed in Florida got laughter from Matthews, and then this response: "Gun safety is a no-no, huh? You can't talk about that even with mothers." Because it was a focal point in the interview, we wanted to see if it was true. About the gun bill We've written about the bill in question, HB 155, twice before. The bill passed the Legislature and was signed into law by the governor on June 2. The original version of the bill created a firestorm -- and fodder for national television -- because it sought to punish doctors with imprisonment or fines up to $5 million for asking a patient or a patient's family about gun ownership and gun habits. House sponsor Rep. Jason Brodeur, R-Sanford, said the bill was drafted partly as a reaction to American Academy of Pediatrics guidelines, which encourage physicians to counsel parents on creating a safe home environment and offering advice to avoid preventable accidents. The recommendations include mainly innocuous tips like "Keep plastic bags and balloons away from your children," and "NEVER place an infant in front of an air bag." Physicians also are encouraged to tell parents to remove guns from places where children live and play. In another case, Brodeur said an Ocala woman was turned away from her pediatrician after she refused to say whether she owned a firearm. The multimillion-dollar fines and possible prison time were stripped from the bill, and the final language was watered down as part of a compromise between the Florida Medical Association and the National Rifle Association. Under the bill that ultimately passed: * Health care providers cannot enter gun ownership information into a patient's medical record "if the practitioner knows that such information is not relevant to the patient's medical care or safety, or the safety of others." * Health care providers cannot ask questions to patients or their families about whether they own a gun, unless the provider "believes that this information is relevant to the patient's medical care or safety, or the safety of others." * Health care providers cannot discriminate against patients because they own firearms. * Health care providers should "refrain from unnecessarily harassing a patient about firearm ownership during an examination." The penalties for violating the new rules could cost a doctor his or her license. Or they could face a fine up to $10,000. While the Florida Medical Association supported the legislation, other groups of doctors -- including pediatricians remained in opposition, saying the law violates the free speech rights of doctors and "also deprive patients of potentially life-saving information regarding safety measures they can take to protect their children, families and others from injury or death resulting from unsafe storage or handling of firearms." (A group of doctors has since said they plan to sue over the law). But the question for this fact check is whether the bill prohibits doctors from talking to their patients about gun safety in the home, as Graham said. The answer is not explicit. The law prohibits -- in many cases -- a doctor from asking their patient or their family if they own a firearm. But the bill does not prevent doctors from discussing firearm safety. So a pediatrician could counsel patients that if they own a gun, they should keep it stored away from small children. But they couldn't specifically ask if the patient owned a firearm, unless a doctor believed the information was relevant to the patient's medical care. They also could not "harass" a patient about gun ownership, according to the law. The law doesn't define "harassing" or detail scenarios when a doctor is allowed to ask about gun ownership -- and that has some doctors worried. "The law would virtually guarantee that some health care professionals who are simply following established protocol by informing patients of the lethal risks of firearms will be brought before a disciplinary board if a patient categorically objects to any discussion or inquiry on the subject of household firearms," attorney Bruce Manheim wrote in a letter to Scott urging his veto on behalf of the Florida Chapters of the American Academy of Pediatrics, American Academy of Family Practitioners and the American College of Physicians. "Consequently, beyond imposing express prohibitions on protected speech, the legislation is also so vague, and its sanctions are so severe, that health care professionals will be chilled from freely engaging in speech with their patients." Graham said in an interview with PolitiFact Florida that the chilling effect generated by the bill could stop doctors from even talking about guns. "I'm a hunter, have guns, etc., but I don't think you need to deny parents professional information about how to keep their children safe," he said. "This law is an over-extension of what constitutes proper respect for people's Second Amendment rights." Graham also had us speak to a Tallahassee pediatrician who has been fighting the law, Dr. Louis St. Petery. St. Petery told us that pediatricians have a long list of potential hazards they want to discuss with patient's families. That's why asking if a gun is important, because it helps focus discussions during the limited time doctors and families have. As a result of this law, St. Petery said pediatricians will withdraw from asking about or discussing guns. That will result in an increase in gun-related injuries and deaths, he said. "Sen. Graham is 100 percent correct," St. Petery said. Brodeur, the bill sponsor, provided the counter argument. He said HB 155 "doesn't prevent the safety conversation at all," in a posting on Twitter. Our ruling On MSNBC's Hardball, Graham said the Florida Legislature had passed a bill "prohibiting doctors to talk -- particularly pediatricians -- to talk to their patients about gun safety in the home." The bill doesn't go that far. HB 155 creates restrictions for doctors wishing to ask their patients (or families) if they own a gun, and says health care officials should "refrain from unnecessarily harassing a patient about firearm ownership during an examination." Doctors remain able to address gun safety in general, though some say the threat of getting in trouble may hinder or prevent that discussion from taking place. The difference here is asking about gun ownership versus talking about gun safety. We rate this claim Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.	None	Bob Graham	None	None	None	2011-06-06T11:35:36	2011-06-01	['None']
pomt-01639	Points of Light is "the world’s largest volunteer organization."	mostly false	/georgia/statements/2014/aug/26/michelle-nunn/nunns-ad-claim-misses-mark/	President George H. W. Bush spoke at his inauguration in 1989 of "individuals and community organizations spread like stars through the nation doing good." Out of that vision came the nonprofit Points of Light. And out of Points of Light came Michelle Nunn, a Georgia native with a do-gooder resume, political pedigree and desire to be the state’s next U.S. senator. In a new television ad, Nunn, a Democrat, criticizes the business tactics of millionaire David Perdue, her Republican opponent in the race to succeed retiring U.S. Sen. Saxby Chambliss. The TV ad begins by introducing Nunn as "CEO of the world’s largest volunteer organization." That line gave pause to a PolitiFact reader, who contacted us to say he was pretty confident that the international Red Cross, not Points of Light, holds that distinction. We truthfully had no idea but promised to investigate. First, a little on the very different work undertaken by the two nonprofits. The Red Cross, the world’s largest humanitarian organization, is best known for promoting blood donations and for being on the scene when disaster strikes with food, clothing and temporary housing assistance. Points of Light, President Bush’s brainchild, mobilizes volunteers through a network of 250 volunteer action centers worldwide, through its programs for youth and national service alumni and through its partnerships with thousands of companies and nonprofits. Nunn, daughter of former U.S. Sen. Sam Nunn, has been its CEO since 2007, when it merged with the Hands on Network, a nonprofit she helped create and ran. She’s on leave from Points of Light while campaigning. On its website, Points of Light says it had 4 million volunteers worldwide in 2012. By contrast, the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies, shows a volunteer force worldwide of about 17 million, including 501,208 in North America. (We got that data by adding up country-by-country data we found on its website.) Benoit Matsha-Carpentier, a spokesman for the organization in Geneva, Switzerland, confirmed the accuracy of our math. He provided a Red Cross powerpoint presentation, showing the organization had 17.1 million volunteers around the globe in 2012. So how can Points of Light claim to the "world’s largest volunteer organization?" Points of Light routinely provides a much more nuanced description of its work, although the campaign pointed us to at least two instances -- one in 2007 and one in 2012 -- where the nonprofit did refer to itself as the "world’s largest volunteer organization." Currently, on its web site and elsewhere, Points of Light is identified as "the largest organization in the world dedicated to volunteer service." It’s a title the group is confident it can claim. "We are unaware of any other organization solely dedicated to volunteer service that is using such a wide range of assets to increase the number of volunteers in the world and the impact of the work they do," Stefanie Weiss, Points of Light spokeswoman, said in an email. "We say that 'Points of Light is the largest organization in the world dedicated to volunteer service.' We work with millions of people and tens of thousands of partner organizations to increase the number of volunteers in the world and the impact of the work they do." Tom Pollak, senior research associate at the Urban Institute’s Center for Nonprofits and Charitable Organizations, said the ad’s description of Points of Light "doesn’t strike me as patently disingenuous or deceptive." But he said Points of Light’s description of itself as the "the largest organization in the world dedicated to volunteer service" seems more accurate and "a little less subject" to being misconstrued. Data on volunteerism should be viewed with some skepticism, Pollak said. That’s because some people can be involved in long-term volunteering. Others may be involved in a single event, such as a weekend helping to build a home for a needy family, and the organization may not be keeping careful track of the number of participants, he said. Relying on data reported by non-profits on their federal tax forms, Pollak was able to provide us with a list of the 25 nonprofits reporting the highest number of volunteers, nationwide. No. 1 was the American Heart Association with 22 million volunteers, followed by the Muscular Dystrophy Association Inc. with 15 million. Pollak said he wasn’t aware of information available to do a similar comparison on a worldwide scale. And the Red Cross’s 17.1 million volunteers doesn’t appear to be a record just based on the numbers U.S. organizations use. So where does that leave us? Points of Light has a unique mission carved out by President Bush -- mobilizing volunteers around the world. Nunn has used her stewardship of the non-profit to burnish her leadership credentials in the race against businessman Perdue. But her political ad undercuts how Points of Light describes itself on its website -- as "the largest organization in the world dedicated to volunteer service." That’s substantially different from the world’s largest volunteer organization. .We rate the ad statement as Mostly False.	None	Michelle Nunn	None	None	None	2014-08-26T00:00:00	2014-08-07	['None']
pomt-10585	"Let's not blame President Bush for all of this. We've got a Congress who sat around on their hands and done nothing but spend a lot of money ... leaving us $9-trillion in debt that we're passing on to our grandchildren."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/jan/31/mike-huckabee/congress-delivered-but-after-bush-asked/	Responding to a question about whether Americans are better off than they were eight years ago, Mike Huckabee tried to deflect some of the blame for the nation's economy away from President Bush and onto Congress, which he portrayed as fiscally reckless. "We've got a Congress who sat around on their hands and done nothing but spend a lot of money and they're spending, leaving us $9-trillion in debt that we're passing on to our grandchildren," he said during a Jan. 30, 2008, Republican debate at the Ronald Reagan Library. Huckabee is correct there is a $9-trillion debt — actually, it's $9.2-trillion — and that it will be left to future generations to repay. And he's right about federal spending; it rose a cumulative 53 percent between 2000 and 2007. Because taxes and other receipts didn't rise as fast, the debt soared. But the former Arkansas governor overlooks the fact that President Bush asked for most of the changes that drove up spending, most notably the 2001 and 2003 tax cuts that were not fullly offset by spending cuts and the 2003 Medicare prescription drug bill, which drove up entitlement costs. There also were national security spending increases after 9/11 and the cost of wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. Republican-controlled Congresses delivered on each of these high-priority items, and Bush signed them into law. So at a minimum, the president and Congress share the blame for the fiscal policies Huckabee cites in the eight-year time frame. For that reason, we rate his statement Half True.

pomt-14466	"An economic impact study found that for every $1 invested in pre-K in Pennsylvania, a total of $1.79 is generated in total spending within the state."	half-true	/pennsylvania/statements/2016/mar/03/jim-kenney/would-each-dollar-pre-k-spending-generate-179-loca/	Universal pre-K is one of Mayor Jim Kenney’s top priorities the next four years. He hopes to expand kindergarten to 10,000 more children by 2020, calling it the most important investment Philadelphia can make to change schools’ academic outcomes. To help convince business leaders they can benefit from pre-K as well, he made this claim during a speech given to the Greater Philadelphia Chamber of Commerce: "An economic impact study found that for every $1 invested in pre-K in Pennsylvania, a total of $1.79 is generated in total spending within the state." Kenney has used the statistic before, and David L. Cohen, senior executive vice president of Comcast, also cited it in a recent editorial. Is it legitimate? Kenney’s communications director, Lauren Hitt, said Kenney got the statistic from the Economy League, which used a study from ReadyNation/America’s Edge, an organization with a goal of strengthening business "through better policies for children and youth." Cohen specifically mentioned the same study in his editorial. The study examines the total dollar effect of $1 in pre-K spending on the state’s output. Using a tool called the IMPLAN model, it theorizes that the money spent on pre-kindergarten would lead to new learning centers and new teachers and staff. Those new learning centers would spend locally on supplies and other resources for the pre-K programs, and the teachers would spend the money on food, clothes, restaurants and whatever else they’d need. The businesses would in turn hire more people to meet the increased demand. The estimated economic effect would be an additional 79 cents generated in the economy per dollar spent on pre-k for a total of $1.79. Tim Bartik, author of "Investing in Kids: Early Childhood Programs and Local Economic Development" said the study’s estimate of an additional 79 cents generated per dollar of spending is probably high because it doesn’t take possible tax increases into account, which is the way many early childhood education programs are financed. Kenney hopes to fund the annual $60 million to fund pre-K through a soda tax. Bartik said the likely effect of $1 on pre-K spending, given a tax increase, would be the dollar spent for pre-K and perhaps a little extra. "I could imagine it being greater than a dollar," said Bartik, who is also a senior economist for the Upjohn Institute and has received a research grant from ReadyNation. "How much greater I couldn’t say. It would be a lot of work to get the right answer." He said the estimated impact of an extra 79 cents for every dollar spent was not likely unless the pre-kindergarten program was privately financed. Steve Doster, the Pennsylvania director for ReadyNation/America’s Edge, confirmed the study did not take into account how each $1 spent on pre-K would be raised, such as through an increase of taxes. "When this report was generated it was generated looking at significant public investment from Pennsylvania," Doster said. This doesn’t mean expanded pre-K couldn’t have major benefits. In fact, Bartik said the total economic impact from $1 of pre-K spending could be as much as $3 to $5. But that estimate would include benefits from freeing the time of parents of pre-kindergarten students who could work more hours or gain more skills, the possibility of increased earnings of pre-kindergarten students years down the line and the spillover effects from both of those scenarios. The study being referenced by Kenney and Cohen -- and that would be of most interest to the business community -- is about the short run, the total dollar impact of one dollar spent on pre-kindergarten on the state output. Ron Haskins said there hasn’t been much other research to back the estimates laid out in the ReadyNation/America’s Edge study but reaffirmed what Bartik and several other studies have pointed out in terms of overall economic benefits. No matter what kind of positive economic effect is being predicted, the total would depend on the unknown: the quality of the program. For pre-kindergarten to pay off for businesses or children, it must provide a good education across the board. "I want to emphasize," Haskins said. "Without quality, forget the 79 cents." Our ruling Mayor Jim Kenney cited a study saying every dollar spent on pre-k education in Pennsylvania would yield $1.79 for the state economy. Comcast’s David L. Cohen noted the same study in an editorial. While studies and experts agree the economic impact of quality pre-kindergarten programs could be substantial, the study pointed out by Kenney is about shorter-term effects on the state’s output. Taxes required to pay for the pre-K program could lessen the economic effect, adding up to less than an extra 79 cents per dollar spent. But research and expert opinion illustrate quality pre-K likely will have a substantial, positive effect on the local economy. We rule the claim Half True.

pomt-13263	"In 67 different ways, Governor McCrory has raised taxes on middle income families."	half-true	/north-carolina/statements/2016/oct/14/roy-cooper/roy-cooper-says-pat-mccrory-raised-taxes-middle-cl/	At Tuesday’s debate for the North Carolina governor’s race, Democratic challenger Roy Cooper attacked Republican Gov. Pat McCrory for pushing tax reforms that mostly helped the wealthy. Republicans gained a majority in both chambers of the General Assembly in 2011. After McCrory became governor in 2013, the state passed sweeping changes to tax law. The new GOP leaders cut personal and business income taxes and paid for it in part by expanding the sales tax base and ending some income tax deductions. "The governor promised people a tax cut," Cooper said. "He came through for the corporations and for those at the top, but everyday working people got tax increases. In 67 different ways, Governor McCrory has raised taxes on middle income families. And literally we’re talking about, literally, from birth to death." We wondered if it was really true that the state’s Republican leaders, who so often tout their record on tax cuts, actually raised taxes in 67 different ways. Cooper’s campaign provided us with an itemized list of the increases it was citing from McCrory’s tenure as governor. They do include instances from birth to death — higher fees for screening newborn babies, and a new tax on tombstone installation. Many came earlier this year, in a large expansion of the sales tax base that went into effect in March bearing McCrory’s signature. It created dozens of new sales taxes applied to services and labor. Auto repair shops have long charged sales taxes on parts. Now they must also charge sales tax on their labor. There are new 43 service taxes, all listed here by the Department of Revenue. Cooper’s campaign also pointed us two dozen other instances of laws McCrory has signed since 2013 that increased taxes, created new taxes or reduced or eliminated tax breaks, incentives, deductions and exemptions. So the number is right. In fact Cooper said 67, and his campaign’s list includes 69 examples. A few of them don’t really affect middle class families, like the state’s tax credits for filmmakers that were allowed to expire, or a law that capped the sales tax refund for nonprofits at $45 million — hardly a level the local PTA has to worry about surpassing. However, nearly all of the 69 examples the campaign pointed to do directly affect middle class families. We won’t list them all, but notable examples include: --Ending the annual tax-free weekend for back-to-school shopping. --Ending deductions for contributions made to college savings accounts. --Eliminating a $4,000 deduction for government retirement income and a $2,000 deduction for private retirement income. --Taxing forgiven mortgage debt as income. "The next time you go to a movie or you get your car repaired or you buy school supplies at a back to school weekend, you look at that receipt and the taxes are a courtesy of Governor McCrory," Cooper said at the debate. Cooper is right that McCrory raised taxes 60-plus ways that could affect middle class families. But that’s not the whole story. And we’ve lowered our Truth-O-Meter ratings in the past when politicians have made claims about taxes that left out important context, like this one. And our friends at the Washington Post gave Three Pinocchios to a 2014 claim that the state’s tax changes raised taxes for most North Carolinians. Does Cooper's claim face a similar fate? The GOP tax reforms Before the tax cuts, North Carolina had a three-tier system for individual income taxes, ranging from 6 to 7.75 percent. With the GOP-led changes, the income tax rate dropped to a single flat rate of 5.8 percent, and then dropped again to 5.75 percent this year. The Tax Foundation, a group that advocates for low tax rates, has frequently praised North Carolina for its income tax cuts. So has the libertarian Cato Institute think tank. In 2014 one its budget analysts wrote that "McCrory and the legislature’s plan passed one of the most impressive tax reform packages in any state in years." Earlier this month, McCrory was named one of just five governors with an A on the Cato Institute’s annual report, "Fiscal Policy Report Card on America’s Governors." The cuts, combined with a higher standard deduction – it more than doubled for married couples filing jointly, from $6,000 to $15,000 – could lead to hundreds of dollars of savings each year for a typical middle class family. The state’s median household income is around $50,000. It’s harder to estimate, however, just how much extra the typical middle class family will be paying due to the dozens of tax increases and/or lost deductions that Cooper mentioned. That’s because many of them won’t apply to most families, or aren’t very uniform in their cost. Plumbing, vehicle repairs, car washes and tire services are pretty ubiquitous, but even there the labor costs can vary wildly from business to business. And plenty of the new tax increases – like on boat repairs, shoe shining, jewelry cleaning, bullet reloading and fire extinguisher recharging – won’t apply to most people very often, if ever. There was one tax credit that was eliminated that many people used and we can count easily – the Earned Income Tax Credit. It ended in 2014. In 2011, more than 900,000 households in North Carolina claimed the EITC and got an average of $116 in savings, according to a 2013 study from the liberal Budget and Tax Center. Many families saved more than $116 when their income tax rates were cut. But when you start adding in the additional taxes on services, the other lost credits and deductions, and more? It’s possible some people might be paying more now than they were before the tax cuts – especially on the lower end of the income scale. A 2015 study from the liberal groups Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy (ITEP) and The Budget & Tax Center found that the bottom 20 percent of North Carolinians paid taxes equivalent to 9.2 percent of their income, while the top 1 percent paid taxes equivalent to 5.3 percent of their income. We here at PolitiFact also looked into North Carolina’s tax reforms in 2014 and ruled it Mostly True that the state’s tax changes "overwhelmingly benefit the wealthy." And that was before any of the dozens of new sales taxes were enacted. Those have shifted the tax burden away from the wealthy even more, since sales taxes are regressive in nature. Our ruling Cooper said that "in 67 different ways, Governor McCrory has raised taxes on middle income families." We find his tally of the tax increases to be correct, yet many of them will affect only small groups of people in any given year. And Cooper cherry-picks by leaving out the substantial reduction in the income tax rate, which applied broadly to people at all income levels, even though it did mostly help the wealthy.

pomt-14679	Says President Barack Obama "appointed Eric Holder as attorney general. Eric Holder said he viewed his mission as brainwashing the American people against guns."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/jan/15/ted-cruz/did-former-attorney-general-eric-holder-say-he-vie/	During the Republican presidential debate in North Charleston, S.C., Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, re-litigated the background of President Barack Obama’s former attorney general, Eric Holder. One of the debate moderators, Maria Bartiromo of Fox Business Network, asked Cruz for "the answer" to stopping mass shootings and violent crime. "The answer is simple," he said. "You prosecute criminals. You target the bad guys. You know, a minute ago, (co-debate moderator Neil Cavuto) asked, ‘What has President Obama done to illustrate that he wants to go after guns? Well, he appointed Eric Holder as attorney general. Eric Holder said he viewed his mission as brainwashing the American people against guns. He appointed Sonia Sotomayor to the Supreme Court, someone who has been a radical against the Second Amendment right to keep and bear arms." We raised our eyebrows at Cruz’s mention of Holder and what he said. Is Cruz right? Let’s go to the videotape from back in 1995, a time when there really were such things as videotapes. In January 1995, Holder -- then the U.S. Attorney for the District of Columbia -- gave a speech announcing a plan to curb gun violence in the city of Washington, D.C. Here’s a portion of the speech, recorded by C-SPAN. "What we need to do is change the way in which people think about guns, especially young people, and make it something that’s not cool, that it’s not acceptable, it’s not hip to carry a gun anymore, in the way in which we changed our attitudes about cigarettes," Holder said. He later added, "We have to be repetitive about this. It’s not enough to have a catchy ad on a Monday and then only do it Monday. We need to do this every day of the week, and just really brainwash people into thinking about guns in a vastly different way." So there’s video proof that Holder did indeed say what Cruz said he did. That said, we’ll offer two caveats. First, the way Cruz phrased his statement might lead listeners to believe that Holder had talked about "brainwashing" during his tenure as attorney general or shortly before he was nominated by Obama for the post. That’s not the case -- the remark in question came a full 14 years earlier. Second, Cruz leaves out the context in which Holder was speaking. As the top federal law enforcement official for the District of Columbia, Holder was speaking at a very particular time about a very particular place. At the time, drug-related crime and gun murders in Washington were a serious concern, both locally and nationally. A few years before, D.C. had been dubbed the "murder capital of the world." In other portions of the speech, Holder can be heard referring specifically to youth violence in the nation’s capital and referencing local officials such as once-and-future mayor Marion Barry. This D.C. focus by Holder is supported by a Jan. 13, 1995, Washington Post article that preceded the speech but which laid out a general overview of Holder’s initiative. "U.S. Attorney Eric H. Holder Jr. said yesterday he is completing the details of a massive law enforcement effort to get guns off Washington's streets," the article says. "It will target people carrying and selling firearms in the city's most violent neighborhoods." In addition to tougher law enforcement, Holder was proposing efforts to change " ‘romanticized’ perceptions about guns and violence, especially among young black men." Holder -- the first African American to serve as U.S. attorney in Washington -- was planning to unveil the speech on Martin Luther King Jr.’s birthday. "As a people, did we fight, did we sacrifice, did we die simply to inherit and then bequeath to our children this kind of America where crimes run rampant and fears stalk our citizens?" Holder wrote in a draft of the speech, according to the Post. Holder told the Post that the goal of the effort was designed to reduce violence in Washington by the end of the decade to levels prior to 1986, when crack cocaine sent homicides and shootings soaring. "I believe that if you can really change the way young people, especially young black men, view the possession and use of guns ... you can have a significant impact on the quality of life in this city," Holder told the Post. This is a nuance that Cruz’s statement ignores. Our ruling Cruz said Obama "appointed Eric Holder as attorney general. Eric Holder said he viewed his mission as brainwashing the American people against guns." Holder unquestionably said the word "brainwash." But Cruz leaves out some important context -- how long ago the comment was made, and the fact that it was targeted toward youth during a high-crime era in Washington, D.C., not the overall American public.

pomt-01652	Wisconsin is "38th in the country in terms of proficiency standards" in student testing.	mostly true	/wisconsin/statements/2014/aug/22/mary-burke/wisconsin-ranks-low-expectations-school-testing-sc/	Much attention is paid to how well Wisconsin schoolchildren score on standardized tests -- what percentage of them are proficient, for example, in reading or math. But states define proficient differently. So just how rigorous are Wisconsin’s standards? Mary Burke, the Democratic challenger to Gov. Scott Walker, raised that issue in response to a question posed by the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel in a news article published Aug. 11, 2014. The Journal Sentinel asked: "Common Core: Should Wisconsin scrap or modify these academic standards for students? If so, should the state cover the costs of doing so for schools?" Burke replied by saying, in part: "Common Core is an opportunity, if implemented correctly, to make sure our young people are ready for the workplace or college. Students will have the critical thinking skills needed to compete with students in any state or any country. We absolutely need higher standards in Wisconsin –- we are currently 38th in the country in terms of proficiency standards –- and implementing Common Core correctly will do just that." Let's see if, on a national scale, Wisconsin’s standards are relatively weak. Federal statistics One authority on proficiency standards is the U.S. Department of Education’s National Center for Education Statistics, which does "mapping studies." States develop their own assessments and set their own standards as to what it means for a student to be proficient. What the mapping studies do is compare each state's standard for proficient performance by placing the various state standards onto a common scale. The latest mapping study was done in 2011, based on data from 2009. Results from testing of fourth- and eighth-graders on reading and math were used. The study found that the proficiency standards set by most states are at or below what the U.S. Department of Education defines as Basic. Basic is defined as "partial mastery of prerequisite knowledge and skills that are fundamental for proficient work at each grade." There was no ranking of how states and the District of Columbia fared overall. But there was a ranking by grade and subject. Here are Wisconsin's rankings: 4th grade reading 39th--behind bordering states of Illinois, Michigan, Minnesota and Iowa 4th grade math 30th--ahead of Illinois and Michigan 8th grade reading 43rd--behind all four bordering states 8th grade math 37th--ahead of Illinois and Michigan Burke’s evidence To back Burke’s claim, her campaign cited a slightly different and newer ranking from a September 2013 article in the Education Next journal. The lead author was Paul E. Peterson, the journal’s editor and director of Harvard University's Program on Education Policy and Governance. Peterson uses a different methodology than the mapping study and used more recent data, from 2011. Peterson also utilizes the fourth- and eighth-grade reading and math testing, but gives the states an overall rank, as well as a letter grade. Here’s how Wisconsin and its neighboring states fared among the 50 states and the District of Columbia: State Rank Grade Minnesota 8th B Wisconsin 38th C-minus Iowa 41st D-plus Illinois 46th D Michigan 48th D-minus The three top-ranked states -- Massachusetts, Tennessee and Missouri -- were the only ones that earned an A. The article emphasized that the rankings list states in terms of how high their expectations are, not in terms of what percentage of the students are proficient. Another comparison In July 2010, the Washington, D.C.-based Thomas B. Fordham Institute, which works to reform education, compared standards in the various states to those of Common Core, the voluntary English and math standards that Wisconsin and nearly every other state has adopted. The study ranked Wisconsin based on the standards it had in place before adopting Common Core. For English standards, the institute gave Wisconsin a grade of D, saying the standards "are generally clearly written and presented, and include some rigorous content. Unfortunately, their failure to provide grade-specific expectations creates critical gaps in content that leave teachers without the guidance they need to drive rigorous curriculum, assessment and instruction." For math standards, Wisconsin received an F. The math standards "are scant," the institute said. "They are provided only for the end of fourth, eighth, and twelfth grades, and very few standards are provided for each grade band." Peterson, the professor who ranked Wisconsin 38th, told us that since Wisconsin has adopted Common Core, its future ranking could change once it administers tests with the new definitions for proficiency. But those rankings won’t be done for a few years, he said. Our rating Burke said Wisconsin is "38th in the country in terms of (school) proficiency standards." The ranking she cites is from a respected national source and is the latest available, although it is based on 2011 data. Wisconsin has since adopted the new Common Core standards, which could change the state’s ranking in the future. For a statement that is accurate but needs additional information, we give Burke a Mostly True.	None	Mary Burke	None	None	None	2014-08-22T05:00:00	2014-08-11	['None']
pomt-14536	Since January 2015, the "majority of our" Austin City Council "meetings have extended past 10 p.m." and "many of our meetings have gone past midnight."	mostly false	/texas/statements/2016/feb/15/sheri-gallo/sheri-gallo-incorrectly-says-majority-austin-city-/	Just after 10 p.m. during a January 2016 Austin City Council meeting, a council member suggested the governing body was too often meeting for way too long. That particular meeting had convened at 10:21 a.m. Jan. 28, according to city records, and members didn't adjourn until after 2 a.m. Jan. 29 (though they had a 90-minute dinner break). The length was mostly due to hours of public testimony about proposed regulation of the Uber and Lyft ridesharing services and proposed changes to how the city regulates rental properties. Council Member Sheri Gallo made her claim after falling on the losing end of a 10-1 council vote to extend the meeting. City code requires a council vote if a Thursday meeting needs to stretch past 10 p.m. Gallo declared: "I think the majority of our meetings have extended past 10 p.m. … Many of our meetings have gone past midnight." She added: "I really think it's a disservice to our community, a disservice to our city staff, it's a disservice to the council members, … We just need to figure out another way to handle this so that our meetings are being completed at a reasonable hour." It wouldn’t be a shock if the council has had at least a few extra-long meetings. Before voters moved to elect 10 council members from districts with only the mayor elected citywide, the previous council (consisting of six members and the mayor, all elected citywide) ordered a study of its meetings running late. A resulting December 2014 report from the city auditor, Corrie Stokes, said that from October 2013 through September 2014, council meetings had lasted an average of 9 hours, 31 minutes – three times longer than such meetings in comparable cities like San Antonio, Phoenix and Oklahoma City. Together, she reported, eight peer cities clocked in with average council meeting lengths of 3 hours, 24 minutes. The study also said Austin had been holding fewer council meetings than its peer cities with council members tackling more items per meeting. A vow not to go so late When Mayor Steve Adler was sworn in with the new council in January 2015, he vowed to end late-night meetings. "You won’t have to be at City Hall at 3 a.m. just so your elected leaders can hear your voice," Adler said in his inauguration speech on Jan. 6, 2015. Part of Adler’s council-backed solution was to meet more frequently. A new 10-committee system, replacing six previous committees, launched in March 2015 with the goal of members vetting issues and hearing public testimony before items reached the full council. An October 2015 Austin American-Statesman analysis revealed the new council and its committees had spent 664 hours in meetings from January through September 2015; the previous council and its committees had spent 337 hours in public meetings during the comparable portion of 2014. Gallo’s backup We asked Gallo how she reached her conclusion about the majority of council meetings running past 10 p.m. By phone, she said her statement came from her recollection of how many times the council had voted to extend a meeting past 10 p.m. Meeting videos To our inquiry about meeting lengths, Thomas Grauzer, in the city clerk’s office, said we could gauge the length of council meetings over any time period by checking beginning and end times on city-posted meeting videos. From the videos on the city’s council meeting website, which includes transcripts of many city meetings, we determined that from Gallo’s Jan. 6, 2015, swearing-in through Jan. 28, 2016, the council met one way or another more than 100 times -- counting regular meetings, work sessions, budget meetings, discussions and special called meetings. But we zeroed in on the council’s regular meetings, usually held on two or three Thursdays a month, mindful that historically those gatherings most often ran long. Upshot: Of the council’s 28 regular meetings from January 2015 through Jan. 28, 2016, the mayor banged a dozen --a little less than half -- to a close after 10 p.m., videos show. And of those late-nighters, five ended after midnight (only one of those occurring before July 2015). And what drove the late-nighters? Hotly contested topics, it appears, including changes to the city’s short-term rental ordinance, regulations for transportation network companies like Uber and Lyft, taxicab permitting and increasing the city’s homestead tax exemption. These divisive issues garner a lot of public testimony, where citizens sign up to speak for or against issues. The latest-running meeting of the new Council, on Nov. 12, 2015, extended until 2:25 a.m. The Jan. 28, 2016 trailed directly behind that, ending at 2:17 a.m., after nearly 200 people signed up to speak on short-term rentals, according to the city’s transcript. SOURCE: Website, "Austin City Council," City of Austin (accessed Feb. 3, 2016) Longtime observer David King, vice president of the Austin Neighborhoods Council, told us he’d been to almost every city council meeting since 2014 and had spoken as a private citizen on many issues through the years. By phone, King speculated that having 11 council members increased debate; more members mean more people piping up. "I do think, too, that because we have this new 10-1 system, more people are showing up at the meetings," King said. "And that’s a good thing."

"We made a promise to the citizens of Austin to eliminate late-night meetings," Gallo said. "I think any meeting that lasts past 10 p.m. is one too many." Our ruling Gallo said that since January 2015, the "majority of our" Austin City Council "meetings have extended past 10 p.m." and "many of our meetings have gone past midnight." There has, of late, been a pile-up of late-running meetings. Yet the big picture is that 12, or 43 percent, of the 28 council's major meetings since January 2015 ran past 10 p.m. with five, 18 percent, stretching past midnight.

pomt-13777	Says as Indiana governor, he has made "record investments in education."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/jul/21/mike-pence/mike-pence-stretches-claim-record-education-spendi/	Republican vice presidential nominee Mike Pence joked at his acceptance speech at the Republican National Convention that most people don’t know who he is. So he offered up his record as Indiana’s governor, an office he’s held since January 2013. Pence claimed that Indiana has "the highest credit rating in the nation." In a separate fact-check, we rated that Mostly True. He also boasted that he oversaw "record investments in education." "In my home state of Indiana, we prove every day that you can build a growing economy on balanced budgets, low taxes, even while making record investments in education and roads and health care," Pence said in his July 20 remarks. We were curious whether Pence, currently in his third year as Indiana’s governor, really has passed "record investments in education." Well, it depends on how you count it. In raw dollars, Pence’s claim holds up. But when adjusted for inflation, education spending at its highest point under Pence is still lower than it was in 2010 and 2011, before Pence took office. We got some help from Larry DeBoer, a professor of agricultural economics at Indiana’s Purdue University who has compiled state budget data. Prior to Pence, Indiana education spending for K-12 and higher education combined peaked at $9.3 billion in 2011, according to DeBoer’s data. Not adjusting for inflation, education spending has surpassed that peak every year from 2014 on. Estimated spending in the current fiscal year tops $10 billion. But adjusted for inflation, estimated spending for the current fiscal year is about 1.1 percent less than it was in 2011. The graph below shows raw dollar spending in blue and inflation-adjusted spending in red. (For calculating the inflation-adjusted spending, DeBoer used 1982-84 dollars according to the Consumer Price Index.) While education spending under Pence is certainly on the rise, the pace of that increase proves not to be so dramatic when adjusted for inflation. Also, the graph appears to show a huge jump in spending leading into 2010. DeBoer noted that this reflects a big change in the spending structure among the state and localities, so it’s not useful to compare education spending today to pre-2010. One more way to put the state’s education spending in context is to look at its size compared with the Indiana economy. Education spending as a share of total Indiana income has been on a consistent decline since 2010, but it is becoming a bigger share of the state budget overall, DeBoer noted. Our ruling Pence said that as Indiana governor, he has made "record investments in education." In raw dollars, Pence’s statement is accurate. However, when adjusted for inflation, education spending at its highest point under Pence is still lower than it was in 2010 and 2011, though only marginally so. Pence’s statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details, so we rate it Half True. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/b0b5816d-36f3-4049-99a0-04214ec03408	None	Mike Pence	None	None	None	2016-07-21T01:39:32	2016-07-20	['Indiana']
pomt-03916	In a budget deal struck in 2011 "a trillion dollars of cuts went into effect immediately, and then a special committee was set up ... to get agreement on another $3 trillion of cuts."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2013/feb/25/bill-nelson/sen-bill-nelson-says-2011-budget-deal-included-imm/	As Washington wrangles over how to avoid the sequester, Florida Sen. Bill Nelson spoke with a Central Florida news station to help explain the issue — and now viewers question his accuracy. Anchor Ybeth Bruzual had asked Nelson, a Democrat, about mandatory budget cuts set to go into effect March 1: "How did we get to this point?" Here’s what he told viewers of Central Florida News 13, a partner of PolitiFact Florida: "Well, a year and a half ago, when the country, in order to pay its bills, (and we) had to raise the artificial statutory debt ceiling so the country could pay its bills, a deal was struck: a trillion dollars of cuts went into effect immediately, and then a special committee was set up. They were to get agreement on another $3 trillion of cuts. "Hanging over their head was a meat cleaver called the sequester, that was going to be, across the board, over a trillion dollars of additional cuts, but without a scalpel — a meat cleaver. Nobody ever expected the sequester to go into effect. It was never supposed to. It was the onerous alternative that would force the super-committee to come to agreement." Nelson’s right that the sequester’s across-the-board cuts don’t allow for much fine distinction. But was Nelson correct that the 2011 budget deal included "a trillion dollars of cuts went into effect immediately, and then a special committee was set up ... to get agreement on another $3 trillion of cuts"? Budget Control Act of 2011 Some viewers argued the cuts Nelson described as going into effect "immediately" were limits on future growth, hardly immediate. Here’s the deal: In summer 2011, the federal government was reaching its legal debt limit, which meant Congress had to authorize a higher level for borrowing to cover its spending. House Republicans insisted that spending cuts go along with an increase to the debt limit. After rancorous debate, lawmakers passed the Budget Control Act of 2011. The law set up caps on future discretionary spending that the Congressional Budget Office estimated would reduce spending by about a trillion dollars between 2012 and 2021, compared with what it would have been if annual appropriations grew at the rate of inflation. The cuts weren’t specified, but would be carried out by lawmakers during the annual appropriations process, with a trigger for across-the-board cuts if they busted the caps. (There were exceptions for certain kinds of spending, such as for war or disasters.) That’s not exactly the same as "a trillion dollars of cuts went into effect immediately." The law also established a Congressional Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction, the "special committee" that Nelson mentioned. The Budget Control Act required a 12-member panel, half from each party, to suggest legislation to reduce the deficit by at least $1.2 trillion over 10 years. If that process failed — and it did — the law required the sequester. That’s what happens March 1 if Washington does nothing. Nelson said "$3 trillion of cuts" -- not $1.2 trillion. His press secretary, Ryan Brown, noted "there was no specific amount the committee had to cut in the legislation, or a limit to how much they could cut." That’s true if you mean cuts in spending, rather than cuts in the deficit — the law required the committee to achieve at least $1.2 trillion in deficit reduction, not necessarily spending cuts. Raising taxes would also reduce the deficit. Brown explained that Nelson had hoped the committee "would do another $1.5 trillion to $3 trillion in deficit reduction." But that’s not what Nelson said. He told TV viewers the committee was set up "to get agreement on another $3 trillion of cuts," as though that were part of the deal reached by lawmakers in the Budget Control Act. There was a $3 trillion proposal floating around at the time. It was a deal offered to the deficit reduction committee in October 2011 by congressional Democrats. Even that proposal, as it was described in news accounts, didn’t include $3 trillion in spending cuts, Rather, it was a package that included cuts, tax increases and new spending that would have trimmed $3 trillion from federal deficits over a decade. Republican House Speaker John Boehner rejected the offer. Our ruling Nelson said the 2011 budget deal included "a trillion dollars of cuts went into effect immediately, and then a special committee ... to get agreement on another $3 trillion of cuts." Nelson missed some things here. The trillion dollars in savings in the Budget Control Act take place over 10 years (not immediately), and must be implemented by lawmakers through the annual appropriations process. Meanwhile, the committee charged with further cutting the deficit had to reduce it by $1.2 trillion to avoid the sequester, not get agreement on $3 trillion in cuts, as Nelson said. He’s partially accurate, but misses some important details. We find his statement Half True.	None	Bill Nelson	None	None	None	2013-02-25T07:58:44	2013-02-21	['None']
pomt-01214	A sign in Dearborn, Mich., for the Advancement of Islamic Agenda for America says, "Allah be praised. America we will kill you all and nothing you can do to stop it."	pants on fire!	/truth-o-meter/statements/2014/nov/24/facebook-posts/viral-meme-says-islamic-group-posted-threat-kill-a/	A reader recently sent us a meme circulating on social media that purports to be a threat by radical Muslims to mass-murder Americans. The meme was pasted into an email with the subject line, "A sign in Dearborn, Michigan." (Dearborn has an unusually large Muslim population.) Headlined, "This is what liberalism will buy you," the meme features a photograph of a sign with removable letters, purportedly advertising a group called the Advancement of Islamic Agenda for America. The sign reads, "Allah be praised. America we will kill you all and nothing you can do to stop it. Allah be praised." The meme concludes with the line, "Still think they are kidding." (The question mark for that last sentence was mysteriously missing.) A pretty scary sign if true. But is it? Hardly. We searched for a group called Advancement of Islamic Agenda for America on the Web and found no trace of it. More importantly, the sign comes from a template on the website Church Sign Maker. The site allows people to create photos of church signs conveying any message they choose. The site allows users to "create your own funny photos and graphics -- simply type in some text and choose from a few simple options. You can create your own church sign, make an official seal, have your own fire or police badge, and more." In this particular meme, the threat is a custom message that uses the site’s "Classic Design #5." The backgrounds of the template and the Facebook meme are identical. (Snopes.com has also debunked this claim.) Some notable text on the main page of the Church Sign Maker page: "Note: these church signs aren't real, they don't exist in the real world." Our ruling The meme claims that a sign in Dearborn, Mich., purportedly hung by a group called the Advancement of Islamic Agenda for America says, "Allah be praised.

pomt-12626	In New York state, "you cannot charge an older person even one dollar more than a younger person" for health insurance.	true	/new-york/statements/2017/mar/31/chris-collins/new-york-law-prohibits-higher-health-insurance-pre/	Democrats in Congress say the Obamacare repeal and replacement bill would have allowed health insurance companies to charge older Americans more for coverage. The American Health Care Act -- pulled from the House floor last week after it became clear the plan would be defeated -- would have allowed insurance companies to charge older Americans up to five times more for health coverage than younger Americans. Rep. Chris Collins, R-Clarence, addressed the issue during a town hall-style event on CNN before Republican leaders pulled the bill. "In New York under our state insurance commissioner, we have what we call a one to one," Collins said. "You cannot charge an older person even one dollar more than a younger person." The Affordable Care Act remains the law. While insurance companies are still allowed to charge older Americans up to three times more for coverage under that law, Collins says that’s not the case in New York state. Is he right that New York state residents pay the same price for insurance regardless of age? New York state law New York state has had what’s called a "community rating" model of health insurance since 1993. It requires health insurance companies to charge the same price for coverage in select regions regardless of age, gender, occupation or health status. The bill, sponsored in 1992 by Assemblyman Pete Grannis, a Democrat from New York City, passed with bipartisan support from both chambers and then-Gov. Mario M. Cuomo. The bill changed the state’s insurance law from the federal model, which allows different pricing based on age, and guaranteed "the premium for all persons covered by a policy or contract form is the same … without regard to age, sex, health status or occupation." It remains on the books today and now includes the same protection for tobacco users. Although the price is the same for different ages within each region, the regions are allowed to have different prices statewide. There are eight regions in the state. Vermont is the only other state that requires the same health insurance price for all ages. What about federal law? Experts we spoke to said New York state’s model works with the Affordable Care Act and would not have changed under the American Health Care Act. "Federal law preempts state law, but sometimes it creates a floor instead of a ceiling for actions that can be taken by the states," said Rachel Morgan of the National Conference of State Legislatures. "You must also consider that states until recently were the principal regulators of the business of insurance and instituted requirements that best served their markets." The floor, in this case, is the federal cap on age-based health care premiums. New York state’s law stands because its added restriction does not change federal law but supplements it. Our ruling Collins said in New York "you cannot charge an older person even one dollar more than a younger person" for health insurance. Collins is right. New York state has barred insurance companies from pricing based on age for more than two decades. Experts say the Affordable Care Act did not impact that law, and its would-be Republican replacement would not have either. We rate his claim True.

pomt-10525	"We are bogged down in a war that John McCain now suggests might go on for another 100 years."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/mar/05/barack-obama/straight-talk-twisted/	The Democratic candidates and groups that oppose John McCain have been quoting the Arizona senator as saying the United States could be in Iraq for 1,000 years. "John McCain says it's okay with him if the U.S. spends the next thousand years in Iraq," Rose Forrest, an Iraq war veteran, says in an ad for VoteVets.org that aired in Washington, D.C., in late February and is still available on the Web. "That's some commitment to the Iraqi people, Sen. McCain." A YouTube video known as "John He Is" uses humor to make the same point. It spoofs a pro-Obama music video called Yes We Can . The parody has grainy footage of McCain saying, "I don't think Americans are concerned if we're there for a hundred years or a thousand years or 10,000 years" and ends with these words on the screen: "IRAQ WITHDRAWAL DATE: 12,008 . . . . GOOD LUCK WITH THAT IN NOVEMBER." (We're not putting the parody to the Truth-O-Meter, but it's worth checking out to see a funny perspective on McCain's comments.) Sen. Barack Obama made a similar charge (but without the catchy music) during the Democratic debate in Cleveland, Ohio, on Feb. 26, 2008, when he said, "We are bogged down in a war that John McCain now suggests might go on for another 100 years." The videos and Obama's statement made us wonder about the full context of McCain's remarks and whether the comments were portrayed accurately. We've previously addressed Sen. Hillary Clinton's claim about the 100-year remark with this item, but McCain has elaborated since then. So in this article, we will examine the new claims. It's well known that McCain has been a strong supporter of the Iraq war, even when his position harmed his presidential campaign. At a town hall in Derry, N.H., on Jan. 3, 2008, McCain was glib about the need for a long-term U.S. commitment: QUESTION: "President Bush has talked about our staying in Iraq for 50 years — " McCAIN: "Make it a hundred." Q: "Is that — " McCAIN: "We've been in South Korea . . . we've been in Japan for 60 years. We've been in South Korea 50 years or so. That would be fine with me. As long as Americans are not being injured or harmed or wounded or killed, that's fine with me. I hope that would be fine with you, if we maintain a presence in a very volatile part of the world where al-Qaida is training and equipping and recruiting and motivating people every single day." Three days later, he was asked about the remark on CBS's Face the Nation. He likened the future U.S. role in Iraq to other nations where the United States has a military presence: "My point was and continues to be, how long do we have to stay in Bosnia? How long do we have to stay in South Korea? How long are we going to stay in Japan? How long are we going to stay in Germany? All of those, 50-, 60-year period. No one complains. In fact, they contribute enormously, their presence, to stability in the world," McCain said. "The point is, it's American casualties. We've got to get Americans off the front line, have the Iraqis as part of the strategy, take over more and more of the responsibilities. And then I don't think Americans are concerned if we're there for 100 years or 1,000 years or 10,000 years. What they care about is a sacrifice of our most precious treasure, and that's American blood. So what I'm saying is look, if Americans are there in a support role, but they're not taking casualties, that's fine." When McCain was asked about the remark Jan. 9 on ABC's Good Morning America, he said the U.S. presence could last 1-million years: "Could be 1,000 years or a million years," he said. "We have bases in Kuwait right now. We have bases in South Korea and Japan, Germany. I mean (the allegation by critics is) a straw man. It's a fallacious argument by people who don't understand that it's not American presence, it's American casualties. If we can get American casualties down and eliminate them, Americans are not concerned — in fact, they may be glad we have a secure base in that part of the world as we do in Kuwait." The interviews show McCain is not advocating that the war in Iraq continue for a thousand years (or a million). But once combat ends and U.S. casualities dwindle, he expects the United States could have troops in Iraq similar to the presence in South Korea and Germany. That presence could continue for many years. Clinton correctly described the first remark by saying "Sen. McCain said the other day that we might have troops (in Iraq) for 100 years." We gave that a True. But Obama twisted McCain's words in the Cleveland debate. He said, "We are bogged down in a war that John McCain now suggests might go on for another 100 years." As we explain above, McCain was referring to a peacetime presence, not the war. So we find Obama's statement False.	None	Barack Obama	None	None	None	2008-03-05T00:00:00	2008-02-26	['None']
pomt-13775	Says Rep. Tammy "Duckworth has been a staunch supporter of expanding the spending, size and reach of the IRS."	false	/illinois/statements/2016/jul/21/mark-kirk/congresswoman-tammy-duckworth-staunch-supporter-ir/	Does U.S. Rep. Tammy Duckworth want more Internal Revenue Service auditors coming after taxpayers? As U.S. Sen. Mark Kirk, a Wilmette Republican, ratchets up his first re-election campaign, he recently suggested his Democratic opponent in one of the nation’s most competitive Senate contests was strongly in support of expanding the Internal Revenue Service. In a campaign website press release, the Kirk campaign called Duckworth "a staunch supporter" of expanding the federal agency that collects taxes and audits taxpayers, businesses and organizations. We wondered if the suburban Democrat really did want more taxing, collecting and auditing out of the IRS. The context The IRS came under majority Republican fire in recent years for what the GOP said was the tax agency targeting conservative-leaning nonprofits. In 2013, IRS division head Lois Lerner apologized and acknowledged the agency had targeted certain groups for audits of their tax-exempt status. In response, Republicans offered several pieces of legislation designed to rein in the agency taxpayers love to hate. U.S. Rep. Peter Roskam, R-Wheaton, sponsored legislation that came up for a vote last April called the "Preventing IRS Abuse and Protecting Free Speech Act." His proposal was one of four cited by Kirk campaign spokeswoman Eleni Demertzis to support the claim that Duckworth was a strong supporter of expanding the IRS reach. According to the federal government website Congress.gov, Roskam’s bill would prohibit the IRS from requiring tax-exempt organizations to include details about their contributors in annual returns. Party-line votes Duckworth was one 182 Democrats who opposed what was, primarily, a party-line vote. Kent Redfield, a political science professor emeritus at the University of Illinois-Springfield who specializes in campaign finance, said the Roskam bill was more focused on political donors and freeing nonprofit groups from having to disclose to the IRS who was funding them. To suggest the bill is about IRS expansion is "a mischaracterization of what the bill is about," Redfield said. "There’s a policy argument there about how much transparency you need, but it isn’t about protecting taxpayers." Roskam’s bill was opposed by the Center for Responsive Politics and other groups that favor campaign funding transparency, Redfield said. "That’s just too broad," he said. "It’s a mischaracterization of the issues and the intent of what the legislation was. It’s painting with too broad a brush." Three other IRS-related bills were cited by the Kirk campaign to back up his claim: HR 4890, HR1206 and HR 4885. HR 1206 would ban the IRS from hiring new employees if any current workers had serious federal tax debt. It would require the agency to certify its employees didn’t owe back taxes. HR 4885 required the tax agency to deposit fees into the treasury and prohibited it from spending without congressional approval. The last bill, HR 4890, would have stopped the IRS from giving employee bonuses until the treasury secretary submitted to Congress a customer service improvement plan. John Frendreis, a Loyola University political science professor, explained the federal government has something called a senior executive service in which some managers give up some civil service protections and in place of that get bonuses. Duckworth’s opposition to a bill that would restrict bonuses could be seen as a vote to increase IRS spending. Still, Frendreis said it’s important to keep in mind the Republican-controlled Congress has been progressively shrinking the IRS budget in recent years. "It’s really incorrect to say she’s trying to expand the power of the IRS. She’s simply trying to maintain the level of resources necessary for the IRS to do its work." "It’s technically true, but not totally true," he added. "The rest are really strong distortions." And while Duckworth voted against a bill to ban bonuses and against one that curbed IRS hiring, in both cases, Duckworth Deputy Campaign Manager Matt McGrath noted, the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office analyses of the bills concluded that, overall, they could boost IRS spending by as much as $2.5 million. So, it also could be argued Duckworth’s opposition represented votes to contain the IRS budget. In the case of HR 4885, the bill to require the IRS deposit fees and get legislative approval for spending, the CBO concluded the bill Duckworth opposed would not actually reduce costs at the tax agency. McGrath also pointed to three bills Duckworth supported in 2014 and 2015 that cut IRS spending or held it flat. All four votes cited by the Kirk campaign to back up their claim about Duckworth resulted in partisan roll calls with most Democrats opposing them and most Republicans supporting them. "It does look like all of these are party-line votes," noted David Yepsen, executive director of the Paul Simon Public Policy Institute at Southern Illinois University in Carbondale. "There's a lot of hyperbole in this description. There are a lot of subjective phrases and words there." "This is an unpopular agency," Frendreis said. "It’s an easy target. The purpose of these bills in the first place is to establish this campaign narrative." Our ruling Kirk called Duckworth a staunch supporter of expanding the spending and sweep of the nation’s tax agency. The record shows Duckworth joined most Democrats in opposing four GOP efforts to restrict the agency’s information collection and boost congressional oversight. But independent experts and Congress’ own nonpartisan budget analyst said some of the GOP bills actually would boost spending or would not cut it. Duckworth also has voted for large spending bills that did trim IRS budgets.

pomt-15213	"Every poll said I won the debate."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/aug/11/donald-trump/fact-checking-donald-trumps-claim-every-poll-said-/	Donald Trump loves to call people losers. So it’s no surprise that, when commenting on his own performance in the Aug. 6 Republican presidential debate, he declared himself the clear winner. During an Aug. 9 interview on CBS’ Face the Nation, Trump, the current frontrunner for the GOP nomination, told host John Dickerson, "Most polls, every poll, said I won the debate, which is fine. And I'm sure you have heard that, too. And I think I did win the debate. Some of the candidates told me I won the debate. But I had by far the toughest question. It was not even a contest." Trump has a point, but we also found bad news for him in some of the polls. We’ll explain. (Trump’s camp did not respond to an inquiry.) We’ll start by noting that instant polls pegged to events like debates tend to be trickier to rely on than the traditional random-dial telephone polls. Anyone can cast their vote in such polls, which means that they do not represent a valid cross-sample of the electorate. That said, Trump would have a point if he were to cite a trio of instant polls taken right after the debate. One, which asked DrudgeReport.com readers who won the debate, found 45 percent of more than 585,000 votes cast went to Trump, triple the 14 percent amassed by the second-place finisher, Ted Cruz. Trump achieved similarly buoyant results in smaller polls sponsored by Time magazine (47 percent) and Slate.com (39 percent). However, at least one other post-debate poll undercuts his claim. A more traditional survey of 904 registered Republicans by Gravis Marketing conducted immediately after the debate on behalf of One America News Network found that Trump finished second, though within the poll’s margin of error. Ben Carson won 22 percent of the vote, compared to 19 percent for Trump. That’s a virtual tie, given the poll’s 3 percentage point margin of error. Interestingly, Gravis also asked survey respondents who they thought lost the debate -- and on this question, 30 percent of respondents cited Trump, a percentage second only to Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., with 34 percent. Full results below: In other words, the same poll showed many more voters -- all registered Republicans, in fact -- saying that Trump lost the debate than said he won. In producing sharply polarized responses toward Trump, the Gravis poll wasn’t an outlier, either. On the same morning Trump made his comments, NBC released a post-debate poll conducted with Survey Monkey. The survey had an unusual methodology -- it included responses from 3,551 adults drawn from the nearly 3 million people who take surveys with Survey Monkey. However, the results have some degree of credibility, since the data was weighted for factors such as age, race, sex, educational attainment and region. These results suggest that the general public showed the same degree of polarization about Trump’s performance as can be seen in Gravis’ poll of Republicans. In the NBC-Survey Monkey survey, 22 percent of respondents said that former CEO Carly Fiorina did best in the debate, compared to 18 percent for Trump. But 29 percent of respondents thought Trump did the worst in the debate -- a percentage twice as high as Paul, his nearest competitor, with 14 percent. Here’s the full rundown: Finally, a Suffolk University poll of Iowa Republicans was released on Aug. 11, after Trump's comments. It asked people which candidate was most impressive, and Trump's performance was rated fourth-best, behind Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., Carson and Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas. The poll also asked if people felt more or less comfortable with Trump as a candidate after watching the debate; 55 percent said they felt less comfortable. Our ruling Trump said that "every poll said I won the debate." He has a point that at least three instant polls -- from the Drudge Report, Time and Slate -- showed him with better showings than any of his rivals, though the non-random design of these polls means they should be taken with a big grain of salt. More problematic for his claim is that the methodologically superior Gravis poll showed him finishing second to Carson, and found more respondents saying he did the worst in the debate than the number who said he did the best. The statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details, so we rate it Half True.	None	Donald Trump	None	None	None	2015-08-11T14:36:45	2015-08-09	['None']
pomt-14428	"As governor, Kasich delivered the largest tax cut in the nation."	mostly false	/ohio/statements/2016/mar/09/john-kasich/john-kasichs-tax-cut-largest-nation/	The Ohio primary is a do-or-die moment for presidential hopeful John Kasich, which means it’s time for lots of new political ads. In this one, folksy music plays under a voiceover reminiscent of a Jeep commercial. "Twenty million Americans are out of work. That’s unacceptable. But John Kasich won’t stop until that number is zero. As governor, Kasich delivered the largest tax cut in the nation, and over 400,000 new jobs have been created through his leadership. As president, Kasich will cut taxes, freeze new regulations and reshore American jobs. So punch the clock. Take that to the bank. America, let’s go to work." Ohio is among the states that come up in discussions about big tax cuts. But was Kasich’s truly the largest in the nation? "There are at least half a dozen reasons why there has to be an asterisk after that sentence," said Carl Davis, research director at the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy, a left-leaning think tank. "The ones that come to mind are Kansas and Ohio, and to a lesser extent, North Carolina, Texas, maybe even Florida," said Davis. "But it’s complicated, because tax changes are often enacted in stages, and in some cases are accompanied by tax hikes, like on cigarettes in Kansas and Ohio. Trying to gauge what the revenue of a state would have been without the tax cuts is really difficult." Kasich’s spokesman, Rob Nichols, provided us with a table showing a summary of the governor’s net tax reductions from 2012 through 2017. It shows the net total reductions as $4.9 billion, which the campaign rounds up to $5 billion. Yet Kansas, not Ohio, consistently rises to the top of searches for "largest tax cut." A fellow with the Show-Me Institute, Andrew Wilson, called Kansas Gov. Sam Brownback’s tax reduction "the biggest tax cut of any state, relative to the size of its economy, in recent history," in a June 2015 article in The Week. (The Show-Me Institute is a right-leaning think tank in Missouri.) Shawn Sullivan, the director of budget and business processes for the state of Kansas, provided data on Brownback’s tax cuts. The Kansas state budget office projects that between 2014, when Brownback’s tax cuts fully went into effect, and 2019, the cumulative tax reduction will be $3.9 billion. At face value, it would seem that Ohio’s tax cuts under Kasich, at $5 billion, are larger. But the major hurdle that makes the numbers difficult to get a handle on, Davis says, is consideration for population differences between states. Kansas and Ohio certainly aren’t apples-to-apples. The 2014 U.S. Census pegged Kansas’ population at 2.9 million. Ohio’s population in 2014 was 11.6 million -- nearly four times more people. Then there are those who argue that Kasich’s tax cuts weren’t really tax cuts. A spokesperson with the Ohio Democratic party, Kirstin Alvanitakis, told us, "We would argue very strongly that Kasich’s tax cut was actually more of a tax shift. The state’s cuts to local governments have resulted in local tax hikes." The president of the Ohio Association of Professional Fire Fighters, Mark Sanders, likewise complained that fire and ambulance services statewide have had to ask voters to step up their local tax levels, as decreased revenue from state income taxes slashed budgets for emergency services between 2011 and 2013. Davis, with the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy, said that by some estimates, Kansas’ tax cuts cost over $1 billion per year. "If you adjust for population, that would certainly seem to exceed anything enacted in Ohio under Governor Kasich," Davis said. Kasich’s not-so-humblebrag about his tax cuts rings even less true considering that it was the Legislature that added in a tax cut larger than what Kasich’s 2015 plan originally proposed, by more than double. "He did sign them," Davis concedes, "but his original proposal would have been a lot smaller." Our ruling The Kasich campaign ad says that "as governor, Kasich delivered the largest tax cut in the nation." The ad exaggerated in claiming that Ohio's tax cut topped every other state. While Ohio’s cuts are significant, when you factor in state population and economic size, Kansas’ reduction may be larger over time. Ohio’s shifting of the tax burden, from individual income tax to taxation on consumption, is what some consider more of a tax shift than a tax cut, and forces local governments to raise taxes in turn. Plus, the size of the tax cut wasn’t entirely Kasich’s idea, since it was the Legislature that made it bigger than he first proposed. We rate this claim Mostly False.

pomt-14155	If Austin voters reject Proposition 1, a "completely new City-run" criminal background check "process will cost millions in processing fees, additional staff, and bureaucracy" with taxpayers getting "the bill."	false	/texas/statements/2016/apr/30/ridesharing-works-austin/claim-about-millions-dollars-costs-bill-going-taxp/	Austin taxpayers are in for millions of dollars in regulatory costs if voters decide not to change what the city requires in background checks of drivers for ride-hailing services, a pro-proposition group says. Ridesharing Works for Austin says in a mailer to voters: "A completely new City-run" criminal background check "process will cost millions in processing fees, additional staff, and bureaucracy." The mailer, which came to our attention from a reader, is headlined: "Keep Taxpayers From Having to Pay." Proposition 1, which landed on the May 7, 2016, ballot after a petition drive led by Ridesharing Works for Austin, centers on whether to require fingerprinting of drivers for popular services, like Uber and Lyft, that enable customers to summon a ride using a mobile app. Vote "yes" and company-provided name-based national criminal background checks would continue -- without a fingerprinting element. Vote "no" and driver fingerprints would be gathered and run through the FBI. Rejecting the proposal, the mailer suggests, gives "the City a blank check to fund a takeover" of background checks "and sends taxpayers the bill." So, hide your pocketbook? Not so fast, we found. Council member: Taxpayers not on barrel Before we saw the mailer, an Austin City Council member disputed the notion that taxpayers will be charged for fingerprinting drivers. An April 19, 2016, Austin American-Statesman news story quoted Ann Kitchen, sponsor of the ordinance the proposition would repeal, saying the council agreed to levy a 1 percent fee on the ride-hailing companies’ gross local revenue to go to a city fund to "assist and incent drivers to become compliant" with the new rules. Then again, according to an April 22, 2016, commentary by Ben Wear, the American-Statesman’s transportation writer, that’s to be charged only if companies fail to take certain steps to get drivers fingerprinted as quickly as possible. The incentive fee was created to help allay ride-hailing drivers’ concerns about the costs of the fingerprint check — expected to be nearly $40 per driver, city spokeswoman Alicia Dean told us by email. Dean added: "This is what it costs for checks we do for other driver background checks for other vehicles for hire." We asked if the city or council had decided to cover the costs. Dean replied: "No." There’s also a separate 1 percent fee, to be in place if the proposition passes or not, "to cover the city’s administrative costs and infrastructure needs," the Statesman reported. Upshot: Ride-hail companies could be paying up to 2 percent of gross local revenue to the city though another April 2016 American-Statesman news story says ride-hail companies aren’t expected to owe any general fees until at least the end of 2016. The same story quoted a former council member, Chris Riley, saying that when the council approved its first ride-hail regulations in August 2014, the intent was that any such fees cover city administrative costs. Of course, all this not-so declamation comes from city-connected officials. We were curious how Ridesharing Works for Austin arrived at its millions-of-dollars’ conclusion. To our query, spokesman Travis Considine pointed out by email that prospective-driver fingerprints are to be run through the FBI, according to the ordinance adopted by the council in December 2015. Specifically, the ordinance authorizes the city or an approved "third party" to submit each driver-applicant’s fingerprints to the Texas Department of Public Safety for a search of state criminal records and to forward the fingerprints to the FBI for the national check. "The results of the FBI check will be returned to the DPS," the ordinance says, "which will disseminate the results of state and national criminal history checks to the City." Next, the ordinance says, the department shall use each result to determine if the applicant is prohibited from driving for a Transportation Network Company, as in ride-hail service. Not that the city expects all of this in a hurry. During a phase-in, the ordinance says, the city’s Transportation Department is to implement procedures to help drivers obtain fingerprints and background checks with each company expected to have 99 percent of its drivers checked by February 2017 or be subject to financial penalties. Considine suggested city reviews of each completed check will entail massive upticks in staff and spending to process thousands of reports coming back from the DPS. The services currently conduct name-based checks on their own. Uber lobbyist: 50,000 background checks will burden city Considine also put us in touch with Adam Goldman, an Austin lobbyist for Uber, who said by phone the few city workers who currently review applications for chauffeur licenses can’t possibly be expected to handle the surge in applications likely to come from ride-hail drivers seeking to fulfill the city’s requirements. If voters say "no" to the proposition, Goldman said, city staff stand to see fingerprint-fueled checks submitted for 50,000 drivers -- a figure he said reflects the number of Austin-area residents who have driven at least once for Uber. Hold that count. An Uber spokeswoman, Jaime Moore, previously told us it has 15,000 Austin-area drivers though that total fluctuates. Moore, informed of Goldman’s 50,000 figure, replied by email that nearly 50,000 Austin-area people went through the Uber screening process in the last year -- though many of them didn’t make it through. Still, Moore suggested we put stock in the "50,000" because Goldman didn’t consider Austin-area Lyft drivers. So, Moore said, "we would expect the number" of individuals whose background checks would require the city’s final review "to be much higher than 50,000." Goldman didn’t offer a calculation to back up the predicted "millions" in city costs. But Considine, asked for an equation behind the group’s claim, suggested multiplying 50,000 times the possible $40 charge per background check, which plays out to $2 million. Alternatively, we noted, if you go with the low-end count of 10,000 drivers, you get $400,000 in possible costs. We asked Considine if it’s fair to consider either total a city cost in that the city, far as we can tell, hasn’t said it’s funding the checks. He didn’t reply. It also occurred to us there might be fewer ride-hail drivers if the proposition fails; some might resist fingerprinting. Considine agreed, saying by phone: "That is what happened in Houston. Uber in Houston is different than Austin; the wait times are longer, the surge pricing," pricing at peak travel times, "is higher." Houston official: No spike in taxpayer-funded costs It made sense to us to consider Houston’s experience. The Bayou City has required fingerprint-driven background checks of ride-hail drivers since November 2014, also demanding drug tests, physicals and vehicle inspections. So we reached out to the city’s Administration and Regulatory Affairs Department to ask if administrative costs spiked. By phone, spokeswoman Lara Cottingham said the city experienced an "enormous spike" in applicants after Uber agreed to comply with the city’s security requirements. However, she said, the department didn’t add staff for its final reviews; as before Uber arrived in Houston, a single employee looks over 200 to 300 driver background checks a day. If a background check shows any offense disqualifying a person for a license, the application is denied, Cottingham said, but the city also sets up a hearing for the driver to seek reconsideration, in accord with state law, she said. "There’s been no real change other than she’s a lot busier than before," Cottingham said. Cottingham said driver-applicants are allowed to get fingerprinted by a designated private vendor or may visit the DPS in Austin to be fingerprinted. Generally, Cottingham said, fees paid by Uber, the amount of which she said the company doesn’t consider public information, more than cover city costs. Austin official: Staff can 'flex' Next, we asked Austin’s Transportation Department if the pro-proposition group’s cost claim comports with its expectations. We sought elaboration about flexing up; Dean replied that the department has 12 employees including about eight "administrative personnel" who could process such applications plus at least five professional staff who "could be flexed to review reports." Gordon Derr, an assistant director in the department, earlier said by email: "Possibly, the number of staff may need to increase to handle large numbers of applications, but the activities overseeing vehicles-for-hire are funded by the enterprise fund for the city." That’s not tax revenue, we recognized. By email, a department spokeswoman, Cheyenne Krause, said the ride-hail fees authorized by the council would go into the department’s enterprise fund which to date brings together parking revenue and fees paid by ground transportation service companies and drivers, funding department staff and administration. Derr earlier said: "Possibly, the number of staff may need to increase to handle large numbers of applications, but the activities overseeing vehicles-for-hire are funded by the enterprise fund for the city," which applies to programs generally funded from fees, not taxes. "Costs would not be paid from the general fund," which supports tax-backed activities, "therefore the costs would not be billed to the taxpayers," Derr said, adding: "It has yet to be determined who would be responsible for paying for background checks." Derr said the city has "engaged" a DPS contractor, Morphotrust, to take fingerprints from prospective drivers. Once prints are taken, he wrote, "Morphotrust works through DPS to process the background checks through DPS for the state background check and the FBI for federal background checks." Next, Derr said, the DPS sends results to the city where staff review them. Generally, Krause later told us by email, staff don’t know "what will be required and cannot speculate as to the number of background checks that the City will review or the resources that will be required to review the checks. Any potential costs to the City are purely speculative." Our ruling The Ridesharing Works group said that if voters reject Proposition 1, a "completely new city-run" criminal background check "process will cost millions in processing fees, additional staff and bureaucracy" with taxpayers getting "the bill." This claim isn’t backed up by Houston’s avowed experience or available facts about Austin’s approach. What happens next does seem a bit unsettled. For instance, it's up in the air who’s going to pay for each background check reviewed by the city. We also found no authoritative cost estimate for the city’s oversight. Additional staff might be needed, we learned, yet the relevant department also advises it can lean on existing staff. However, we neither fielded nor found evidence the city’s contemplated reviews of background checks will cost millions. Significantly too, taxpayers aren't poised to get the bill; city costs are to be covered from a fee-backed fund, not tax revenue. We rate this statement False. FALSE – The statement is not accurate.

pomt-04560	"Barack Hussein Obama will ... force courts to accept Islamic Sharia law in domestic disputes."	pants on fire!	/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/sep/26/government-not-god-pac/pac-claims-obama-would-force-sharia-law-courts/	President Barack Obama is a Christian, but a political action committee called Government is not God says his religious sympathies lie elsewhere. The group paid for ads in newspapers across Florida and Ohio that warned, among other things, that if Barack Hussein Obama is re-elected, he "will move America to force courts to accept Islamic sharia law in domestic disputes." We asked the man behind this ad, William Murray, to provide some supporting evidence. Murray cited an item from an anti-sharia group that claimed that U.S. Supreme Court Justice Elena Kagan is "pro-sharia." The evidence was Kagan's encouragement of Islamic legal studies at Harvard. None of Murray's sources referred to the issue of courts and domestic law. Murray also said he was making a prediction and that it is impossible to fact check a prediction. But we are not checking the accuracy of his crystal ball. We are fact-checking whether Obama has said he would force courts to accept Islamic sharia law -- and whether such action is even possible under the U.S. Constitution. Last January, the 10th Circuit Court of Appeals shot down an Oklahoma law that blocked state courts from considering or using sharia law. The Merriam-Webster online dictionary defines sharia law as "Islamic law based on the Koran." The circuit court held that the Oklahoma measure discriminated among religions and thus was unconstitutional. The other item we found was in a Kansas divorce case. The husband in the case, who was Muslim, wanted the property divided according to a marriage contract in keeping with sharia law. In neither case did we find any evidence of action by the Obama administration. Other legal experts confirm this. Glenn Hendrix is managing partner in the Atlanta-based law firm of Arnall Golden Gregory and past chair of the American Bar Association’s section on International Law. Hendrix said there’s no substance to the ad’s claim. On top of that, he said it suffers from a fundamental legal flaw related to the separation of powers. "Even if the administration were somehow pushing sharia law -- and of course it’s not," Hendrix said, "the executive branch cannot force courts to accept any particular law." Hendrix said the Constitution and court precedent trump religious law and cited a bar association report on religious law. "Our courts (both state and federal) have more than sufficient legal tools to permit them to reject foreign or religious law and refuse to enforce foreign judgments that do not meet our fundamental standards of fairness and justice. Constitutional rights (such as those contained in the Bill of Rights) protect everyone in the United States, and all courts throughout the country are bound to respect them. Under our Constitutional order, these rights cannot be infringed, even where foreign or religious law has been chosen by the parties." Hendrix said the only time that a court might rely on sharia law is if it needs to determine the validity of a marriage and the marriage was conducted in an Islamic country. Our ruling The ad from the Government is not God PAC said Obama "will move America to force courts to accept Islamic sharia law in domestic disputes." The PAC offered no evidence -- and we couldn’t find any either. The idea itself runs counter to the constitutional separation of powers and individual protections defined in the Bill of Rights.

pomt-07330	Virginia ranked near the bottom of the nation 50 years ago in per capita income but is in the top 10 today. It had a "very low" rate of higher education attainment but is now above the national average.	half-true	/virginia/statements/2011/may/12/tim-kaine/tim-kaine-says-virginias-higher-education-record-h/	Shortly after former Gov. Tim Kaine announced his U.S. Senate campaign, he spoke about how far Virginia has come over the past half century. "I’m passionate about the Virginia economic story," Kaine, a Democrat, said in an April 21 interview with WAVY -TV in Portsmouth. "We were near the bottom of the nation 50 years ago in per capita income. We’re top 10 now. We were very low in higher ed attainment rate 50 years ago. We’re greater than the national average now." We wondered whether Kaine was right. Let’s start with his statement on per capita income. It’s true the state now ranks in the top 10 in that measure. The federal Bureau of Economic Analysis found in a March 23, 2011, report that Virginia’s per capita personal income in 2010 was $44,762 - the seventh highest in the U.S. Where did the state rank five decades ago? Figures from the Bureau of Economic Analysis show Virginia had a per capita income of $1,906 in 1960, making it the 34th among the 50 states. In 1961, Virginia’s per capita income was $1,975 -- the 17th lowest. So 50 years ago, Virginia was the top state in the lower third of the country in terms of the level of its per capita income. One could argue that being 15 or so spots away from last place doesn’t rank the state "near the bottom" as Kaine said. Let’s turn to Kaine’s comments on how Virginia’s level of higher education attainment has grown in the last half-century. U.S. Census Bureau estimates from 2005 to 2009 show that 33.4 percent of Virginians age 25 and older had a bachelor’s or a higher degree. That was above the national average of 27.5 percent in the age group who had attained at least a bachelor’s degree. So Kaine is right that Virginia outpaces the nation on this measure. The Old Dominion had the sixth highest percentage of people 25 and older who have received a bachelor’s degree or higher. Now for some historical perspective: A U.S. Census Bureau report examining higher education attainment found that in 1960, 8.4 percent of Virginia residents age 25 or older had earned at least a bachelor’s degree. That may seem like a small number, but it was actually higher than the national average of 7.7 percent that year. Among states, Virginia had the 16th highest percentage of residents 25 and older who received a bachelor’s degree or beyond. In short, Virginia’s level educational attainment 50 years ago wasn’t as dire as Kaine made it out to be. In fact it was pretty good compared to the rest of the country. To sum up: Kaine was absolutely right in assessing how Virginia ranks today in per capita income and higher education attainment. But his claims about where the Old Dominion stood 50 years ago have problems. Virginia’s per capita income was indeed lower than most of its peers five decades ago, but there were about 15 states that had lower income levels than Virginia. It’s a bit of stretch for Kaine to say Virginia was "near the bottom.," Virginia was closer to the middle than the bottom. On higher education attainment, Virginia 50 years ago outpaced the national average and most other states in the percentage of its residents earning a bachelor’s degree or higher. So Kaine’s statement that the state had a "very low" rate of higher education attainment 50 years doesn’t pan out. Kaine was right about the present, wrong about the past. Putting the parts together, we rate his claim Half True.	None	Tim Kaine	None	None	None	2011-05-12T12:27:52	2011-04-21	['None']
pomt-09431	"Bill White spent his city billions of dollars into debt (and) saw crime rates soar while he backed gun control."	mostly false	/texas/statements/2010/mar/14/cathie-adams/cathie-adams-chair-texas-gop-says-bill-white-spent/	In a February fund-raising letter, the Texas GOP’s chairwoman, Cathie Adams, calls Democratic gubernatorial nominee Bill White an extreme liberal with the kind of record only a Chicago politician — like President Barack Obama — could admire. Her letter levels six charges against the former Houston mayor, too many for us to cover in a single PolitiFact Texas item so we've split them into three Truth-O-Meter rulings. For this one, we'll focus on the opening part of Adams' blast: "Bill White spent his city billions of dollars into debt (and) saw crime rates soar while be backed gun control." Goodness. That's enough to make one wonder how he thrice won election. Is her fusillade on target? Through an aide, Adams said she based her characterization of White spending the city of Houston billions of dollars in debt on an October memo distributed by a group whose leaders include Bob Lemer, a retired CPA. The memo states the city is broke as a result of overspending and the national recession, and raises the specter of imminent bankruptcy. The city's director of finance and its former director countered in November that the city is not broke and "there is no potential for bankruptcy." Assets exceed liabilities by $1.7 billion, they said, and the city's general fund balances increased from $136 million in 2004 to $332 million in 2008. But the city’s debt load did increase on White’s watch. According to the city, the outstanding debts for all municipal entities totaled $9.9 billion as of Dec. 31, 2003, about when White began his first term. The total exceeded $12.8 billion by Dec. 31, 2009, toward the end of his third term. Over the years, debt went up $2.9 billion, or 29 percent. The subset of debt payable from property taxes — as opposed, say, to income from the airport or other city services — increased at a faster clip. That total was $2 billion as of the end of 2003 and reached $3.3 billion at the end of 2009 — a 65 percent increase while White was mayor. These include $625 million in bonds approved by voters in 2006. Two can play the debt blame game: White has said the state's debt load went up 100 percent on GOP Gov. Rick Perry's watch. We've rated that statement as True. What about crime? Earlier, we Texas rated as True a White statement about Houston’s crime rates dropping to the lowest levels in 25 years on his watch. The rate reached a 29-year low in 2008, though there was an uptick in violent crime in 2005, the year Hurricane Katrina sent thousands of people fleeing to the Houston area. Houston's total crime rate as calculated by the Texas Department of Public Safety fell through most of White's first five years as mayor; finalized figures for 2009, his last year in the office, aren't yet available. Houston had 7,054 criminal offenses per 100,000 residents in 2003, the year before White took office, according to the DPS. The rate increased to 7,186 offenses per 100,000 residents in 2004 before dropping through each of White's next four years as mayor, reaching 6,053 offenses per 100,000 residents in 2008. We also wrote: "These days, few public officials can legitimately take credit for reducing crime locally" because crime rates have been trending down all across the country for decades. The GOP told us that Adams’ claim of soaring crime rates reflects the Houston Police Department reclassification of several deaths as murders after Houston's KHOU-TV reported that nearly 30 violent deaths in 2005 and 2006 should have been listed as homicides. We found no mention of soaring crime in a Wall Street Journal recap of the series. The series is no longer posted on KHOU-TV's Web site and the station's news department declined to comment on the record. Next, the GOP pointed to several news articles in The Houston Chronicle. The most recent, published in August, also does not say crime rates were soaring. But it states that Houston had a higher rate of violent crime than any other Texas city, ranking 8th nationally with 1,105 violent crimes per 100,000 residents, based on the newspaper's analysis of FBI crime data in the 25 most populous U.S. cities. Violent crime includes murder, rape, robbery and aggravated assault, the newspaper said. To make its case for White backing gun control, the Republican Party said White is a member of a national group, Mayors Against Illegal Guns, which says it advocates stricter enforcement of gun laws to keep criminals from unlawfully acquiring handguns. White resigned from the group in late July after being a member since June 1, 2006, the group's spokesman, Jason Post, told us. We asked White why he had remained in the group through the years. White said he agreed with the group's position that authorities need to do better in "tracking down people who steal guns and sell them to people who cannot legally buy guns." White said he quit after his name was listed among many others in an ad funded by the group's political fund urging the U.S. Senate to vote down an amendment (to a Department of Defense measure) offered by South Dakota Sen. John Thune. The amendment, which did not pass, would require all states to recognize concealed-gun permits issued in other states. White said he supported Thune's amendment and doesn't support new restrictions on guns. Generally, the National Rifle Association gives White a "B" grade, meaning that the individual is a generally "pro-gun candidate," the association says online, but may have opposed some pro-gun reform or supported some restrictive legislation in the past. NRA spokeswoman Alexa Fritts told us she wouldn't classify White as anti-gun, especially since he quit the mayors' group, which she called "unfriendly" on Second Amendment issues. The NRA and the group have tangled on tighter regulation of gun shows and making information on gun buyers more widely available. Republican Gov. Rick Perry, who faces White on the November ballot, has an NRA grade of "A," Fritts said, because "he has an incredible track record on Second Amendment issues." So how does Adams' salvo shake out? She's right that White was mayor while the city's debt increased by billions. She misfires with her claim that crime rates soared under White. Her description of White favoring gun control is based entirely on his past membership in the mayors' group and is weakened by the NRA's generally favorable view of White. White himself says he favors no fresh gun restrictions. We rate Adams' three-part fusillade as Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.	None	Cathie Adams	None	None	None	2010-03-14T05:40:30	2010-02-20	['None']
pomt-03512	Says first eight chosen to draw Austin City Council districts are seven Democratic primary voters and one Republican primary voter.	true	/texas/statements/2013/jun/04/derek-ryan/derek-ryan-says-first-8-chosen-draw-austin-city-co/	When Austin announced the first members of a commission that will draw new City Council districts, Republican political consultant Derek Ryan offered quick analysis. Eight names were drawn May 22, 2013, and within a couple of hours Ryan, a voter data specialist and former research director for the state Republican party, tweeted, "Seven are D primary voters, only one has voted in an R primary." Some might think that 88 percent Democratic sounds about right for Austin, the "blueberry in the tomato soup" of Texas politics. In fact, 70 percent of recent voters in party primaries in Austin voted exclusively in Democratic primaries from 2006 through 2012, with 22 percent participating exclusively in Republican primaries, according to numbers that Democratic pollster Jeff Smith of Austin ran for us. Voting in a primary election doesn’t necessarily prove someone’s political lean, though in Texas it’s the closest signal available from voting records. Texans do not register to vote by party affiliation; anyone can vote in either primary, even switching from election year to election year. In Austin, where many down-ticket races field no Republican opposition, sometimes the only way a voter can affect the outcome is by choosing between Democratic candidates in the primary. In the same way, it often makes sense for voters in, say, Midland, to commit to the county’s Republican primary. Council races in Austin are nonpartisan, and while city ordinance says the commission should have "diversity by race, ethnicity, gender and geography," it doesn’t specify any restrictions on members’ politics. But we looked into whether Ryan got the commission members’ votes right. In November 2012, Austinites voted to switch the council from seven citywide members to 10 district representatives and a mayor, starting with the November 2014 election. Some 550 people applied to be on the 14-member commission that will draw the new districts’ maps by Dec. 1, 2013. A panel narrowed the pool to 60 finalists, then city staffers drew names at random, according to the city’s website. The new members will choose six more from the pool of finalists to round out the group. Ryan told us by email, "When the eight were announced, I did a quick check on those individuals," looking at records from the 2006, 2008, 2010 and 2012 primaries. Afterward, he said, he got curious about the other eligible applicants and calculated that 55 percent voted in the 2012 Democratic primary and 24 percent voted in the Republican primary. He started his research, Ryan said, with information from the commission applications the city posted online. Then he matched each applicant’s information to his own voter database, which he said he compiled from information kept by county clerks’ offices and the Texas secretary of state, the state’s chief elections officer. The applicants whose names were drawn for the commission were Magdalena Blanco, Mariano Díaz-Miranda, Rachel Farris, Phil Hewitt, Carmen Llanes Pulido, Art Lopez, Anna Saenz and Maria Solis. All except Llanes Pulido were registered Travis County voters from 2006 through 2012; according to Smith’s records, Llanes Pulido was registered in Travis from 2007 through 2012. If she voted in the 2006 primary somewhere else, Smith said, it probably was not in Texas, because his records showed no voting history for her before the 2007 general election. At our request, Travis County Tax Office spokeswoman Tiffany Seward looked up each new commission member’s 2006-2012 primary voting record and emailed us the results. 2006 2008 2010 2012 Magdalena Blanco D D R R Mariano Diaz-Miranda No vote D D D Rachel Farris No vote D D D Phil Hewitt D D D D Carmen Llanes Pulido Not registered in Travis D D D Art Lopez D D D D Anna Saenz No vote D No vote No vote Maria Solis No vote D D D We sought to speak with all eight for their views and reached everyone but Saenz, although Blanco, Farris, Hewitt and Lopez declined to comment. Farris, incidentally, writes the MeanRachel.com blog, where she is identified as a Democratic activist who also writes for the Huffington Post. Three commissioners who voted in the latest three Democratic primaries said by telephone that voting records did not tell the whole story and party politics won’t bear on the commission’s job. Llanes Pulido told us, "I consider myself politically independent; I do not consider myself a Democrat." She dislikes how primaries cause voters to identify themselves with a party, she said, and as an elections judge had asked voters, "In which primary would you like to participate?" rather than "Are you a Democrat or a Republican?" Party leanings are not germane, she said, "because the Austin City Council is a nonpartisan council and the elections are nonpartisan elections." Díaz-Miranda said Ryan’s tweet wasn’t relevant. "The job we’re doing is to try to bring more people to feel represented," he said. He considers himself independent, he told us. "I’ve also voted Republican here," he said; as an example, he said, he voted for Terry Keel for Travis County sheriff (a post Keel held from 1992 to 1997 before serving as a Republican state representative from Austin). Solis said, "I’m not going to give you an opinion about my politics because that’s not what this is about. … I think I’m a well-informed, balanced person that will vote on what we’re supposed to be doing and not on my party preference." The commission’s job, she said, is to give voters representation that is "hopefully more within their own area, and hopefully they will know the people that they are voting for." Our ruling Ryan said the first choices to draw Austin’s council districts are seven Democratic primary voters and one GOP primary voter. Records show that six of the eight members voted in the three Travis County Democratic primaries from 2008 through 2012, and two of the six also voted in the county’s 2006 Democratic primary. One commissioner voted in the 2008 Democratic primary and didn’t vote in any others. One voted in two Democratic primaries and two Republican primaries since 2006. We rate his statement as True. CLARIFICATION, 11:30 am, June 5, 2013: We revised this story to clarify that 70 percent of recent voters in party primaries in Austin cast ballots exclusively in Democratic primaries. The original version said 70 percent of Austinites had recently voted exclusively in those primaries. This revision did not affect our rating of the claim.

pomt-05415	Wisconsin women "are paid 81 cents to the dollar of a man doing the same job."	false	/wisconsin/statements/2012/may/02/kathleen-falk/gubernatorial-hopeful-kathleen-falk-says-women-wis/	Continuing to accuse Gov. Scott Walker of waging a "war on women," Democratic gubernatorial candidate Kathleen Falk posted a YouTube video that highlights her opposition to the repeal of a workplace discrimination law. Walker’s signature on a Republican-backed bill repealed the right of discriminated workers to sue in state court for compensatory and punitive damages. Asked why the right to sue in state court was needed, Falk told the Oshkosh Northwestern newspaper on April 17, 2012 it was because Wisconsin women "are paid 81 cents to the dollar of a man doing the same job." The key phrase here, which Falk also used in a speech three weeks earlier, is same job. Is she right? We’ve done several items related to the 2009 law, passed when Democrats controlled state government, and its April 2012 repeal three times. Most recently, we gave Falk a False for saying the repeal left women with no options to fight pay discrimination (They could still pursue the claims through other avenues, including federal court) and Walker a Mostly False for saying the old law was "kind of a gravy train" for lawyers (no lawsuits had been filed while it was in place). When we asked Falk campaign spokesman Scot Ross for evidence to back the 81 cents vs. $1 claim, he cited an April 2012 report by the Center on Wisconsin Strategy think tank and the Wisconsin Women’s Council, a state government board that advocates for women. The report says that in 2009, Wisconsin women earned, on average, 81 cents for every dollar earned by men. That’s the same figure Falk cited -- but it measures something quite different. Falk said Wisconsin women earn 81 cents for every dollar earned by men for "doing the same job." What the report says is that -- considering all Wisconsin women and men in the workforce working all sorts of jobs -- women earn 81 cents for every dollar men earn. The report underlines that point by saying that one reason Wisconsin women earn less than men on average is they are concentrated in occupations that pay lower wages, including in retail, services, education, nonprofits and health care. Laura Dresser, associate director of the Center on Wisconsin Strategy, confirmed that the report does not say what Falk said it did. We could say case closed, but we wondered whether there are statistics measuring the pay of Wisconsin men and women who work in the same job. Dresser said she didn’t know of any such studies, but suggested we contact the Institute for Women’s Policy Research, a Washington, D.C. think tank. The institute provided us an April 2011 report it did on women in Wisconsin. The D.C. think tank examined a slightly different population -- adults who worked full time year round in 2009. Its report found that Wisconsin women earned 75 cents for every dollar earned by men. But, again, that figure is for all occupations, not women and men working in the same job; and the D.C. think tank, like the Wisconsin groups in their report, noted that women tended to work in lesser-paying occupations. We did find evidence on the national level that women tend to be paid less than men in many occupations. According to the D.C. institute, among 111 occupations for which weekly median wage data could be estimated for 2010, men earned more than women in all but four occupations. The largest gap was among personal financial advisors, with women on average earning 58 cents for every $1 earned by men. But in relation to Falk’s claim, those figures are national and apply to types of occupations, not to men and working the same job. Our rating Falk said Wisconsin women "are paid 81 cents to the dollar of a man doing the same job." To be sure, as a group women are paid less than men and they are in many individual instances. But she misquoted the report she relied on. What the report said is that, among all working men and women in Wisconsin working all sorts of jobs, women earn 81 cents for every dollar earned by men. We rate Falk’s "same job" statement False. (You can comment on this item on the Journal Sentinel's web site)	None	Kathleen Falk	None	None	None	2012-05-02T09:00:00	2012-04-17	['None']
pomt-11014	"I have watched ICE liberate towns from the grasp of MS-13."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2018/jul/09/donald-trump/did-ice-liberate-towns-donald-trump-claimed-have-w/	President Donald Trump argued against calls by some Democrats to abolish Immigration and Customs Enforcement, saying he’s watched the agency "liberate" towns from the violent MS-13 gang. "The Democrats are making a strong push to abolish ICE, one of the smartest, toughest and most spirited law enforcement groups of men and women that I have ever seen. I have watched ICE liberate towns from the grasp of MS-13 & clean out the toughest of situations. They are great!" Trump tweeted June 30. (Read more about the growing calls to abolish U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement.) Trump repeated the message in a July 5 tweet, "Every day, the brave men and women of ICE are liberating communities from savage gangs like MS-13. We will NOT stand for these vile Democrat smears in law enforcement. We will always stand proudly with the BRAVE HEROES of ICE and BORDER PATROL!" We wondered: Has ICE freed towns from MS-13’s dominion, as Trump claimed? Trump’s tweet did not say which towns had been liberated, or when. ICE referred PolitiFact to the White House for comment. The White House did not respond to repeated requests for clarity. We searched for facts to support the statement but did not find any. ‘A gross exaggeration if not a fabrication' MS-13, or Mara Salvatrucha, operates in at least 40 states with an estimated 10,000 U.S.-based members. The street gang "has a large presence" in New York, Virginia, and the Washington, D.C. metropolitan area, the U.S. Justice Department has said. The FBI does not have a breakdown of their presence by state or location, said FBI spokeswoman Nora Scheland. Trump’s use of "liberate" suggested that towns had been under the rule or full control of MS-13. But neither the White House or ICE have named such towns. Experts on sociology and gang research told PolitiFact they were unaware of U.S. towns wholly controlled by the gang, and that Trump’s wording sounded like political hyperbole. "This is hyperbolic and misleading language," said Jorja Leap, an adjunct professor of social welfare and director of the Health and Social Justice Partnership at UCLA Luskin School of Public Affairs. "Liberation is usually the terminology of military forces — as in, the Allies liberated France from the Nazis." "The claim is sort of outrageous and rather difficult to support since no U.S. government or state government has identified a city over which we lost sovereignty or control," said Fulton T. Armstrong, a research fellow at the Center for Latin American and Latino Studies at American University. "MS-13 in certain cities have made inroads, in certain neighborhoods and schools, but to say entire towns have been under MS-13 control, that simply has never been substantiated," Armstrong added. "In the absence of any evidence, one would have to say it's either a gross exaggeration if not a fabrication, because we've never known that." It would be a major accomplishment if a town got rid of MS-13’s presence, said David C. Pyrooz, an assistant professor of sociology at the University of Colorado, Boulder. "But most gang crackdowns or raids only temporarily improve the condition of communities by reducing crime and fear, since the underlying factors giving rise to gangs and violence go unchanged by these police practices," Pyrooz said. MS-13 targets immigrant communities News outlets have reported on MS-13’s brutal violence, its recruitment efforts, and the fear its members instill largely in immigrant communities and minors who come to the United States illegally without a parent or guardian. MS-13’s primary target is the immigrant community, though there have been cases where non-immigrants have also been victims, said Joseph Kolb, executive director of the Southwest Gang Information Center, which accumulates and shares gang-related information and training with law enforcement at local, state and federal level. MS-13 gang members have been charged in the 2016 murders of New York teenagers Kayla Cuevas and Nisa Mickens, who were walking together in their hometown. "MS-13, they don’t control towns, but they control niches in towns," Kolb said. MS-13, like any ethnic or racial gang, have higher levels of crime in certain areas and flourish in the communities that they live in, Kolb said. Trump generally omits the fact that MS-13’s main targets are immigrants. ICE not only agency involved in MS-13 efforts Hundreds of gang members from MS-13 and others have been arrested in ICE-led operations over recent years. It’s worth noting that ICE isn’t necessarily the only law enforcement unit going after gang members. Established in 2005, Operation Community Shield is ICE’s anti-gang enforcement initiative that works with other federal, state and local law enforcement agencies. "Gang-related enforcement activity is much more effective in areas where the partnership between ICE (Homeland Security Investigations) and local law enforcement is strongest," ICE’s website said. A six-week ICE-led gang operation that ended in May 2017 resulted in the arrest of 1,378 people (1,095 confirmed as gang members and affiliates). The majority of the arrested were U.S. citizens. And of the 1,378 arrested, 104 were MS-13 gang members, according to ICE. ICE’s Homeland Security Investigations division arrested nearly 800 MS-13 gang members in fiscal year 2017 and 405 in the first-quarter for fiscal year 2018, the agency previously told PolitiFact. Attorney General Jeff Sessions in October 2017 also said he was designating MS-13 as a priority for the Organized Crime Drug Enforcement Task Forces. The coalition includes ICE, the FBI, Internal Revenue Service, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, U.S. Department of Labor Inspector General, and others. "Large gang crackdowns, especially those involving violent gangs, often include multiple agencies," Pyrooz said. "It would be rare, although not necessarily impossible, for a raid to occur without the assistance of local police, owing to the ground-level intelligence that police have on the gang dynamics in a city." Our ruling Trump tweeted, "I have watched ICE liberate towns from the grasp of MS-13." Neither ICE nor the White House identified towns that had been under MS-13 rule and were then liberated by ICE. Experts said the gang targets niches or immigrant communities within larger jurisdictions, and did not have entire towns within its violent grasp. Raids by law enforcement temporarily improve the safety of communities, but usually do not act as permanent solutions because the underlying circumstances of gang violence remain. With no evidence to support it, Trump’s statement rates False. ' See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com	None	Donald Trump	None	None	None	2018-07-09T16:00:39	2018-06-30	['None']
pomt-00647	"Austin is the only city in an arid landscape in the western United States dependent on a single source of water."	half-true	/texas/statements/2015/may/18/sharlene-leurig/water-expert-says-austin-only-city-arid-western-us/	Austin’s not the only city in the midst of drought that’s grappling with long-term questions about its water supply. Still, could it be more vulnerable than others? Sharlene Leurig, who directs the sustainable water infrastructure program at the Boston-based nonprofit Ceres, recently called Austin’s dependence on the Colorado River for water a "critical vulnerability." Leurig went on at a Feb. 9, 2015, Austin City Council workshop: "Austin is the only city in an arid landscape in the western United States dependent on a single source of water." Leurig’s caveat Austin all alone? We sought elaboration from Leurig, who replied by email with a caveat: "Of the top twenty major cities by population, Austin is the only city in an arid climate with a single source of water. Of course if you looked at all the cities west of the Mississippi, this isn’t true, but for major cities, it is." Leurig, who chaired the city’s water resource planning task force in 2014, added by phone she’s never explicitly researched the question, but she’s become familiar with water systems nationally through her job advising investors who buy water utility debt. Austin has enjoyed abundant water for decades, Leurig said, thanks to the chain of dammed lakes breaking up the Colorado River. Meanwhile, she said, other cities west of the Mississippi have diversified their supplies because existing water wasn’t abundant or in reaction to "stress events." For instance, she said, the Dallas-Fort Worth region was motivated by the historic 1950s drought to build reservoirs farther east, in wetter parts of Texas. In contrast, she said, Austin faced its first comparable crisis with the Texas drought that started in 2008. Leurig was correct about Austin drawing all its drinking water from one source, the Colorado River. To be precise, river water is pulled from Lake Travis and Lake Austin, which are both part of the seven-member Highland Lakes system. There’s a long-term reason for this dependence. In 1999, the city prepaid $100 million to the Lower Colorado River Authority to guarantee water to Austin from the river through at least 2050. The authority manages a 600-mile stretch of the Colorado River in Texas and the Highland Lakes by Austin. Two of the lakes, Buchanan and Travis, have had historically low inflows of water in the drought, leading Leurig and others, such as Mayor Steve Adler, to say Austin’s long-term rights to water matter not if there isn’t enough water in the lakes--and that it’s time for Austin to look at diversifying its sources. Nature Conservancy scientist For another take on Austin’s unusual reliance on a single water source, we turned to Rob McDonald, a senior scientist of urban sustainability at the Nature Conservancy, who worked on a project mapping the water sources of 220 U.S. cities plus 534 cities outside the U.S. (A Google search led us to the map; a Nature Conservancy spokesman connected us to McDonald.) McDonald pointed out that if all western cities are considered, Austin likely wouldn’t be the only one to use a single water source. According to McDonald’s map and city websites, some smaller towns--as close to Austin as Killeen 70 miles northwest or as distant as Billings, Montana--rely on just one source. Also, McDonald said, numerous cities essentially rely on a single source because they draw 80 to 90 percent of the water supply from one surface source like a river or lake, McDonald said. He pointed to Las Vegas as an example; the Las Vegas Valley Water District’s website says southern Nevada gets almost 90 percent of its water from that state’s Colorado River; 10 percent comes from groundwater. It’s also not always clear, McDonald said, whether a particular body of water should be counted as one or two sources. Yes, Austin draws its water from the Colorado River, he noted, but water from the Edwards Aquifer flows into the river. Asked about this point, an Austin Water Utility spokesman, Jason Hill, agreed that various "tributary creeks and rivers, runoff, and springs" flow into the Colorado River. But, Hill said by phone, it’s a "stretch" to consider the Edwards Aquifer a city water source. That’s because the city doesn’t pump water directly from the aquifer, Hill said. All the water the city uses, all the water the city has rights to, is in the river, Hill said. Checking city water supplies We endeavored to test Leurig’s claim for ourselves by fetching a U.S. Census Bureau list of the top 20 U.S. cities by population as of July 2013. Then, we mapped out those cities and narrowed the list to the ones west of the Mississippi River: Austin (of course), Houston, San Antonio, Dallas, Fort Worth, El Paso, Phoenix, San Diego, Los Angeles, San Jose and San Francisco. Next, we contacted each city’s main water supplier, in many cases the city’s utility. Each of the 10 other populous cities reported more than one source for water though our hunt proved a little muddy in that cities varied in how they defined a "water source." Who knew? By phone, Leurig said that in her view, a source is "hydrologically distinct." For instance, a river and its tributary are not hydrologically distinct, but two rivers that don’t merge are, Leurig said. Separately, to our inquiries, representatives of the American Water Works Association and the Texas Water Development Board each advised there isn’t a standard definition of a water source, leaving this aspect unsettled. Houston: As of 2015, the Bayou City was getting 75 percent of its drinking water from the San Jacinto and Trinity rivers. The remaining 25 percent came from the Chicot and Evangeline aquifers, city spokesman Alvin Wright told us by email. San Antonio: Officials with the San Antonio Water System told us the utility taps seven water sources, topped by the underground Edwards Aquifer, which provided 77 percent of the water in 2014. (The system serves most of Bexar County, which is home to San Antonio, and other nearby areas). A report emailed to us by water system spokeswoman Anne Hayden showed that in the year, other water sources were: Edwards Aquifer water pumped out of the aquifer and stored in the Carrizo Aquifer (8 percent) Groundwater from the Carrizo Aquifer in southern Bexar County (4 percent) Surface water from Canyon Lake, which is part of the Guadalupe River system (4 percent) Groundwater from the Carrizo Aquifer in Gonzales County (3 percent) Groundwater from the Trinity Aquifer (2 percent) Groundwater from the Carrizo Aquifer in Guadalupe and Gonzales counties, and surface water from Lake Dunlap, which is part of the Guadalupe River system (2 percent) Hayden said by phone the water system previously drew water from Medina Lake, which is fed by the Medina River, but recently stopped after its level sank. Though the San Antonio Water System clearly has more than one source of water, we wondered if the system overcounts. After all, some of the listed sources appear to originate from the same place, such as the Carrizo or Edwards aquifers, or the Guadalupe River. Hayden and Darren Thompson, the director of water resources for the San Antonio Water System, said by phone there are key differences between those sources, such as who regulates the water. For instance, the city pulls some of its water directly from the Edwards Aquifer under a permit from the Edwards Aquifer Authority, Thompson said. Once that water is put into the Carrizo Aquifer and later taken out, it doesn’t fall under the authority’s regulations. Different bodies regulate different supplies from the Carrizo Aquifer, Hayden said. Thompson also pointed out that the city draws from different points of the expansive underground source in three counties: Bexar, Guadalupe and Gonzales. The water can have different characteristics, such as mineral level, depending on where in the aquifer it is taken, Thompson said. Phoenix: This city’s hydrologically distinct sources as of 2015 were the Salt River, the Verde River, the Colorado River and groundwater from the Salt River Valley Aquifer. Just over half of the city’s water was coming from the Salt and Verde rivers, a little less than half from the Colorado River and the rest is from the aquifer. Kathryn Sorensen, water services director for Phoenix’s water services department, said by phone the city has "roughly 100 legally distinct supplies." For instance, the city’s rights to water from the Salt and Verde rivers have different priority levels depending on what date the water was first put to "beneficial use," she said. Priority matters, because the lower the priority, the sooner the water will be cut off when river flows slow. Phoenix's access to Colorado River water - which also has different priority levels - comes through subcontracts with the U.S. Secretary of the Interior, settlement agreements approved through the U.S. Congress, and leases with various Indian communities in Arizona. Dallas: In 2020, according to Dallas Water Utility projections, about 47.5 percent of the city’s water will come from the Trinity River, with the Sabine River and its tributary making up 52.5 percent, Denis Qualls, a senior program manager with the Dallas Water Utility, told us by phone. Fort Worth: As of 2015, about 80 percent of the city’s water was coming from the Cedar Creek and Richland-Chambers reservoirs, said Mary Gugliuzza, spokeswoman for the city’s water department. Cedar Creek is fed by Kings Creek while Richland-Chambers is fed by Richland Creek and Chambers Creek - all of which are separate from the Trinity River, said Chad Lorance, spokesman for the Tarrant Regional Water District, by phone. The Trinity River provides the rest of the city’s water, Gugliuzza said. El Paso: As of 2015, El Paso Water Utilities was getting 70 percent of its water from the Mesilla Bolson and Hueco Bolson aquifers, utility spokesman Javier Camacho said by email. Another 4 percent of its water consisted of brackish Hueco Bolson water treated in the Kay Bailey Hutchison Desalination Facility. The remaining 26 percent was coming from the Rio Grande and is stored about 120 miles north in Elephant Butte, New Mexico. San Diego: As of 2015, the city got nearly all its water--85 to 90 percent--from two sources, city spokesperson Arian Collins said by email, namely the Colorado River and the Sacramento-San Joaquin River Delta with 10 to 15 percent coming from rainfall runoff captured in reservoirs. The delta, where the rivers merge to flow to the Pacific Ocean, provided water to two-thirds of Californians, according to the California Department of Water Resources. Los Angeles: On average in 2009-14, the city got a little more than half its water from the Sacramento-San Joaquin River Delta and the Colorado River; 34 percent from the Los Angeles Aqueduct, fed by snowpack from the Eastern Sierra Nevada Mountains; and 12 percent from the San Fernando Valley Aquifer, a source mostly replenished with stormwater, Michelle Figueroa, city water and power department spokeswoman, told us by email. San Jose: John Tang, a spokesman for the San Jose Water Company, said that as of 2015, the company served about 80 percent of the city and was pulling 40 percent of its water from the Santa Clara Groundwater Basin. Another 50 percent was coming from the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta, Tang said, with the rest consisting of rainfall captured in a reservoir in the Santa Cruz mountains. San Francisco: As of 2015, most of the city’s water, 85 percent, was coming from the Hetch Hetchy watershed in Yosemite National Park, originating as snowmelt and running into the Tuolumne River, said Paula Kehoe, director of water resources for the San Francisco Public Utilities Commission. Some 15 percent of the city’s water came from the Alameda and Peninsula watersheds, where reservoirs captured rain and runoff and also stored Hetch Hetchy water, Kehoe said. Less than 1 percent of the city’s water was coming from groundwater from the Sunol Filter Galleries. Our ruling Leurig said Austin is the only city in an arid landscape in the western United States dependent on a single source of water. That’s not so, as she acknowledged to us, and even if you limit the focus to big cities, some of those--such as San Francisco and arguably San Antonio, which seems to overcount its sources--get more than four-fifths of their water from a source.

pomt-06609	Says the United States has the highest incarceration rate in the world with 2.3 million inmates, and the majority of Americans are imprisoned because they sold small amounts of drugs.	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/sep/22/gary-johnson/gary-johnson-says-us-prisons-are-packed-small-time/	Presidential candidate Gary Johnson, a longtime advocate of legalizing marijuana, says U.S. prisons are packed with too many small-time drug dealers. In a meeting with the editorial board of The Telegraph in Nashua, N.H., the former New Mexico governor explained some of the reasoning for his controversial position: "We now have 2.3 million people behind bars in this country, we have the highest incarceration rate of any country in the world," Johnson said. "The majority of those people behind bars are there because they sold small amounts of drugs." We'll examine his claim in two parts: Is the U.S. really a global leader in incarcerating citizens? And are small amounts of drugs such as marijuana really to blame? Johnson’s New Hampshire Communications Director Matt Simon pointed us to some sources behind Johnson’s claim, citing data from the Bureau of Justice Statistics and World Prison Brief, a publication of the International Centre for Prison Studies at the King's College School of Law in London. We checked the Bureau of Justice Statistics figures and confirmed there were 2.3 million prisoners in local jails and state and federal prisons at the end of 2009. The World Prison Brief lists prison population rates per 100,000 residents of each country. The U.S. tops the list with 743 prisoners per 100,000 residents, followed by Rwanda with 595, the Russian Federation with 559, Georgia with 547 and the Virgin Islands (USA) with 539. So Johnson is right with the first part of his claim about the total and the top ranking. But do small-time drug dealers make up the majority of U.S. prisoners? It depends whether you consider local, state or federal inmates, according to Tracy Snell, a statistician with the U.S. Bureau of Justice Statistics. The Bureau of Justice Statistics only investigates information regarding offense types every 5-7 years through inmate surveys, Snell said. So we had to go back to 2002 and 2004 for the most recent data that included the three levels of incarceration to determine what percentage of inmates were held for selling drugs. The data reveal: * Local level: 12.1 percent, which is far short of a majority. * State level: 14.6 percent, also far short of a majority. * Federal level: 50 percent. Because the overwhelming majority of all prisoners are held at the state and local level, the number imprisoned for drug offenses is significantly short of a majority. Also, those numbers include all drug sales under the category drug trafficking. The percentages would likely be even smaller if they were limited to sales of small amounts of drugs the way Johnson suggested. In our correspondence with Johnson’s campaign, Communications Director Simon admitted the error. "After communicating with a few experts, I can now confirm that the third claim is inaccurate," Simon said. "I believe the real number of those incarcerated for all drug-related crimes is closer to 25 percent of the overall population of incarcerated persons. "Johnson may have been thinking specifically of the federal inmate population when he made the statement, and although there's difficulty in defining ‘small amounts,’ the statement is closer to being true if applied to inmates in federal prisons." Gov. Johnson also admitted his need to clarify, Simon said. "I just spoke with Gov. Johnson about his error and he said, ’I stand corrected, thanks!’ so I'm sure he won't repeat this claim," Simon said. So Johnson was correct to say that the U.S. has highest incarceration rate in the world, with an estimated total of 2.3 million inmates,but he was wrong that the majority of those imprisoned are being held for selling small amounts of drugs. We rate Johnson’s claim Half True.	None	Gary Johnson	None	None	None	2011-09-22T17:50:55	2011-09-19	['United_States']

Giuliani, Trump’s attorney, has been in the news since he spoke to Fox News’ Sean Hannity on May 2 about money paid to adult film actress Stormy Daniels. Giuliani said that Trump had repaid Trump attorney and fixer Michael Cohen to silence Daniels who alleges she had an affair with Trump in 2006. While the clickbait headline by The Political Voice could create the impression that Giuliani resigned from Trump’s legal team, that’s not the case. The story said that Giuliani resigned from his law firm, Greenberg Traurig. Giuliani took an unpaid leave of absence from the firm’s New York office in April and then in May resigned to focus on his work as one of Trump’s personal lawyers on the Russia investigation. Richard A. Rosenbaum, executive chairman of Greenberg Traurig, confirmed in statements to the media that Giuliani resigned. "After recognizing that this work is all-consuming and is lasting longer than initially anticipated, Rudy has determined it is best for him to resign from the firm," he said. A headline said "Official: Rudy Giuliani officially resigns, Trump’s legal team on it's last leg."

pomt-05950	"For the first time in 13 years, our dependence on foreign oil is below 50 percent."	half-true	/ohio/statements/2012/jan/26/barack-obama/barack-obama-campaign-says-us-dependence-foreign-o/	Good news, America: The country is no longer importing the majority of oil it needs. You might have heard about this from a television commercial sponsored by President Barack Obama’s reelection campaign, the first commercial the president’s team has run in the 2012 race. Obama for America launched the ad Jan. 18 in Ohio, Michigan, Iowa, Virginia, Wisconsin and North Carolina. "For the first time in 13 years, our dependence on foreign oil is below 50 percent," the announcer says on the ad. Obama repeated the claim Jan. 24 in his State of the Union address, too. In the ad, the Obama team listed its source right on the screen: The U.S. Energy Information Administration, in a report dated May 25, 2011. Since the ad was placed in Ohio and we have to fill our gas tanks like nearly everyone else, PolitiFact Ohio decided to check the facts. About the ad: It wasn’t only about oil. It also touched on "secretive oil billionaires attacking President Obama" -- a reference to ads placed by an outside group, Americans for Prosperity, backed by billionaires David and Charles Koch. The Obama reelection ad also mentioned Obama’s "unprecedented record on ethics," and this country’s expanding clean-energy industry. Other fact-checkers have weighed in on some of these already, with FactCheck.org noting that some of the 2.7 million jobs in the clean-energy sector (a boast on the screen) were gained long before Obama took office, although his policies have added to the gains. The president’s commercial cited PolitiFact as its source for saying that Obama "kept his promise to strengthen ethics rules," but the ad failed to mention that PolitiFact later gave a "Promise Broken" rating to a related ethics promise, concerning lobbying and the revolving door for former government officials. But what about the oil? The Obama campaign is correct that U.S. oil dependence is below 50 percent. According to his own source, the energy administration, it was 49.3 percent in 2010. That’s down from a high of 60.3 percent in 2005. There are several ways to measure foreign oil dependency, the agency adds, and some of the other measures also show a decline but still have U.S. dependence above 50 percent. But we are writing for the general public, not petroleum engineers and economists, and the energy agency itself, staffed by professional analysts, not politicians, certainly includes the broadest measure (net crude and oil product imports as a share of U.S. total demand). Yet this decline in dependence has occurred since 2005. Team Obama is correct in saying dependence only recently -- in 2010 -- fell below 50 percent, but the commercial suggests that the current president deserves credit. The problem with that is apparent when looking at the year--to-year drop, because it mirrors the recession, with the biggest annual decline in 2009. Yes, Obama was president then, serving in his first year. But we’ll let his own source, the energy agency, speak to this. As it says in the very report cited in the commercial: "This decline partly reflects the downturn in the underlying economy after the financial crisis of 2008. Not surprisingly, demand has bounced back somewhat from a low of 18.8 million barrels per day in 2009, when the U.S. economy bottomed out. But the downward trend in consumption started two years before the 2008 crisis and reflects factors such as changes in efficiency and consumer behavior as well as patterns of economic growth." These other factors include increases in domestic biofuels production, natural gas liquids and refinery gains, as well as growth in ethanol production that helped displace traditional hydrocarbon fuels and reduced the need for petroleum imports. And then there were "strong gains in the deep-water Gulf of Mexico and the Bakken formation," ending decades of contraction in domestic oil production. In fact, domestic crude oil production is expected to grow by more than 20 percent in the next decade, according to the energy administration’s latest annual outlook, that was released Jan. 23. Domestic crude oil production should reach a level in 2020 not seen since 1994, the report says. But as PolitiFact has reported before, deep-water production comes after years of exploration and preparation. It does not happen over night and gains made during Obama’s term so far have roots in previous administrations and economic difficulties that have had factories and households paring back. So does that mean Obama deserves no credit at all? Well, no. The energy agency says it expects moderating trends in import reliance to continue even as the economy improves and consumption rises. Energy efficiency, "driven in part by tighter fuel economy standards, will prove increasingly important," the report says. And Obama has, in fact, promoted fuel efficiency, alternative fuels and even offshore drilling, though not as broadly as the energy industry would like. In its new annual report, issued Jan. 23, the energy administration said that the United States will produce far more natural gas and oil by 2035, reducing imports to 36 percent of liquid fuels. The American Petroleum Institute, the oil industry trade group, said that’s great -- but falls short of what could occur with different regulations and policies. That’s a debate for the industry and environmentalists. We’re sticking with the facts, and the fact is that part of Obama’s claim is correct: Our dependence on foreign oil is below 50 percent. But fully evaluating the accuracy of the claim also means looking at the context in which it is made. Obama clearly claims credit in the commercial; and his own source for the claim makes clear that a number of factors, including the poor economy and gains from drilling -- which began before his administration -- are among them. These are important details. Without them, the claim in the ad -- made specifically to boast of Obama’s accomplishments -- lacks context. And when factually accurate claims leave out such important context, the Truth-O-Meter’s dial turns to Half True.	None	Barack Obama	None	None	None	2012-01-26T06:00:00	2012-01-18	['None']
pomt-08073	Says the University of Wisconsin football program is spending almost all of its Bowl Championship Series payout on a Rose Bowl junket for politically connected officials	pants on fire!	/wisconsin/statements/2010/dec/21/charlie-sykes/charlie-sykes-says-university-wisconsin-will-spend/	Taking hard shots at the world of academia is nothing new for conservative Charlie Sykes, who wrote a scathing book about university professors back in the 1980s. Sykes, the longtime WTMJ-AM (620) talk radio host, was at it again recently when he riffed on the University of Wisconsin Badgers and the team’s upcoming trip to the Rose Bowl, the team’s first to the Pasadena, Calif., event since 2000. His target: UW’s plan to pay trip costs for outgoing Gov. Jim Doyle, UW Chancellor Carolyn "Biddy" Martin, members of the UW Board of Regents and other university officials as part of the official Rose Bowl traveling party. "Jim Doyle is getting one last junket out of it," Sykes said on the air Dec. 15, 2010. Sykes mocked UW’s $2.2 million Rose Bowl budget, suggesting it was inappropriate when deficits loom over the state budget. He read aloud from a Journal Sentinel story on the trip costs, reciting that the $2.2 million would cover expenses for players, coaches and the UW band -- plus an estimated 43 people in the "official" traveling group including Doyle. He then noted that UW expected to get a $2.7 million payout from bowl games, including the Bowl Championship Series, of which the Rose Bowl is a part. Sykes then made a leap worthy of Badgers wide receiver Nick Toon: "So basically," he said, "they are using almost all the payout for a junket for the politically well connected types." Sykes then moved on to another topic. But this one is interesting in its own right. And PolitiFact doesn’t just look at politicians or elected officials. It will take on anyone who speaks up in the civic discourse, even if their radio station is owned by the same company (Journal Communications Inc.) that owns the Journal Sentinel. So, is Big Red really blowing most of its bowl take on well-connected suits? In a word: No. When we asked Sykes for support for his claim -- a standard first stop in the items we do -- he quickly backed off. "The only politically connect(ed) hack I know is going is Jim Doyle (and maybe some of the regents)," Sykes wrote in an e-mail that he also posted on his SykesWrites blog. "My ‘evidence’? Absolutely none." Sykes went on to label his remark "an off-hand wisecrack" -- "You know, humor, hyperbole, joke." UW Athletic Department officials weren’t amused. They said it was way off to suggest that most of the bowl money would pay for officials and high rollers. They are still formulating the trip budget and don’t have precise figures, but it will closely mirror last year’s trip to the Champs Sports Bowl in Orlando, according to Justin Doherty, an assistant athletic director. For that trip, some 700 people were involved, about 100 players and 275 band members, plus spirit squad members, coaches, trainers, security, support staff and family members. Various UW administrative officials also were in that group. Doyle did not go. To be sure, that’s a huge crew for a football game -- and this year’s group will likely swell because the Rose Bowl requires a bigger band. So let’s say it’s 750 for Pasadena, of whom 43 are officials from the regents, the UW Athletic Board, the chancellor’s office and elsewhere. That means the "official" traveling party is about 6 percent of the total group, which would translate into about $132,000 of the Rose Bowl budget of $2.2 million. It’s a rough calculation, but by anybody’s math that’s not close to burning up the Badgers’ $2.2 million Rose Bowl budget, much less the larger bowl-game payout from the Big Ten. And that amount may even far more than those Sykes cited. He narrowed his attack to "political types" on the Doyle-appointed Board of Regents (12 are signed up to go) and the governor himself. Plus the suits will not be in Pasadena as long (four nights) as the jocks (eight or nine nights). Sykes’s remarks also suggested taxpayers would suffer because of the "junket." But the Rose Bowl funds flow from revenue generated by bowl games that feature teams from the Big Ten conference -- not tax dollars. Here are the X’s and O’s on the money flow: Eight Big Ten teams made it to the postseason this year. That’s expected to generate $44.5 million for the conference, according to Scott Chipman, the conference’s assistant commissioner of communication. The Rose Bowl alone brings $21.2 million. From that $44.5 million pot, the Big Ten will pay the bowl schools -- collectively -- $14 million in traveling expenses. (Bucky gets $2.25 million for Rose Bowl expenses, a figure that’s set by the Big Ten). Split the remaining $30.5 million among all 11 conference teams and that means each team gets about $2.77 million over and above their expenses. That means that between the $2.77 million and the expenses of $2.25 million for the Rose Bowl, there is $5 million coming in from bowl-related payments. So the Badgers could clear $2.77 million from the bowl season, unless they blow their budget. That has happened before -- at UW’s 1999 Rose Bowl appearance, when the athletic department shelled out $200,000 due to cost overruns. Then-Gov. Tommy G. Thompson, a Republican, UW officials and alumni were part of the entourage that year. Normally we sum up before turning loose the Truth-O-Meter, but it hardly seems necessary in this case. Sykes told his listeners and followers of his blog Friday that he thought the Journal Sentinel would have bigger fish to fry than a "tidbit" on the Rose Bowl. But he didn’t fight the facts, or lack thereof. "Politifact busts me (sort of)" Sykes posted on Twitter. And he cheerfully e-mailed us to have at it: "All I want for Christmas is a "Pants on Fire!" in my stocking!" Your Christmas wish is granted, Charlie. The Truth-O-Meter is glowing Badger red. Pants on Fire.	None	Charlie Sykes	None	None	None	2010-12-21T09:00:00	2010-12-15	['University_of_Wisconsin–Madison', 'Rose_Bowl_(stadium)']
pomt-02603	"The minimum wage is mostly an entry-level wage for young people."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2014/jan/26/mitch-mcconnell/mitch-mcconnell-says-minimum-wage-young-people-ent/	President Barack Obama is expected to take another stab at raising the minimum wage when he delivers his State of the Union speech this week. But Republicans appear ready to stymie that proposal once again. The topic came up Jan. 26, 2014, on Fox News Sunday during a discussion between host Chris Wallace and Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky. "Isn't it reasonable that somebody who's working full time, 40 hours a week, should be able to live above the poverty line?" Wallace asked McConnell, referring to Obama’s calls to hike the minimum wage to $10.10 an hour. "Yeah. But of course, the minimum wage is mostly an entry-level wage for young people," McConnell replied. "We have a crisis in employment among young people right now." McConnell went on to say that he believes raising the minimum wage will hurt employment and "we ought to be doing things that create more jobs." But what about McConnell’s characterization of minimum wage workers? Is it a workforce mostly made up of young folks? We’ll stick to the federal minimum wage, which is $7.25, since that’s the topic up for debate. As it stands, 21 states and the District of Columbia have set their minimum wage higher than the federal level. A spokesman for McConnell pointed us to a study by the U.S. Bureau of Labor statistics, "Characterizations of Minimum Wage Workers," released in February of last year. We’re familiar with it, having written a couple of fact-checks recently on the minimum wage. According to the report, of the 75 million people making hourly wages in 2012, about 1.6 million earned the minimum wage while another 2 million earned less than $7.25 an hour. (How does one earn less than the minimum wage? Certain exceptions are carved out for "vocational education students," "full-time students employed by retail or service establishments, agriculture, or institutions of higher education," and those "impaired by a physical or mental disability.") The underlying data in the report largely backs up McConnell’s claim. In fact, the report even says "Minimum wage workers tend to be young." How young? Only 20 percent of individuals earning hourly wages are ages 16-24, but that demographic makes up half of all individuals earning at or below the minimum wage. About a quarter of those individuals are teenagers ages 16-19 and another 25 percent are 20 to 24 years old. Broadened to include 25-29 year olds, and nearly two-thirds of all workers making at or below the minimum wage are younger than 30. The older you get, the more likely you’re making more than $7.25. Age bracket Percent of workers making the minimum wage Percent of workers making less than the minimum wage Percent of workers making at or below the minimum wage 16-24 55.0 47.1 50.6 25-34 15.5 24.0 20.3 35-44 9.8 11.8 10.9 45-54 10.5 10.3 10.4 55-64 6.4 4.5 5.4 65+ 2.8 2.2 2.5 But McConnell also described minimum wage jobs as "entry-level." That’s a characterization with which some may take an issue. Entry-level jobs typically indicate positions that, while at the bottom of the totem pole, have potential for growth. Young adults take entry-level jobs at companies hoping to climb the career ladder. And while wages are lower, there is potential to see considerable salary increases and/or career advancement. A majority of minimum-wage jobs don’t really fit that description. According to the report, two-thirds are part-time, and half of all minimum wage jobs are in the leisure or hospitality industry. This includes food service jobs like waiters and cooks, hotel employees or movie theater workers, among other jobs. While many of those jobs are traditionally held by young people, they don’t typically lead to careers in those industries. The same can be said for retail jobs, which make up another 16 percent of all minimum wage-or-less positions. Our ruling McConnell said "the minimum wage is mostly an entry-level wage for young people." The Bureau of Labor Statistics found that indeed half of all workers making a minimum wage are 16 to 24, and another 20 percent are in their late 20s or early 30s. That’s a large chunk of the minimum wage workforce, though about 30 percent of people making the minimum wage are 35 and older. McConnell also goes a bit too far in calling these jobs "entry-level." For most young people, these are part-time jobs in the food or retail businesses or similar industries with little hope for career advancement. We rate McConnell’s statement as Mostly True.

pomt-05789	Says "in Oregon only 41 percent of adults have ever been tested" for HIV.	true	/oregon/statements/2012/feb/24/alissa-keny-guyer/have-only-41-percent-oregon-adults-ever-been-teste/	The Oregon House recently took up a bill that would change the way in which health care providers get consent to test patients for HIV. Rep. Alissa Keny-Guyer, the House’s newest member, was one of the carriers of the legislation. She gave a moving floor speech, invoking the memory of her father who passed away from complications due to AIDS in the 1980s. "Much has changed in the past 24 years," she said. "Treatment has reduced transmission." Indeed, she noted, a study last year found that those who were being treated for HIV were 96 percent less likely to pass the infection on to their partners. "The problem is that too many people still go undiagnosed," Keny-Guyer said. Testing rates remain stagnant. But, she said, these new guidelines could boost the numbers of those getting tested in Oregon. "Nationally, 21 percent (of those with HIV) are undiagnosed," she told colleagues. "And in Oregon, only 41 percent of adults have ever been tested." We thought the second figure was a little surprising, especially given that the Centers for Disease Control recommends routine screening for all patients between the ages of 13 and 64 and annual screening (at least) for "high risk" individuals. According to the CDC website, high risk patients include "injection-drug users and their sex partners, persons who exchange sex for money or drugs, sex partners of HIV-infected persons, and MSM (men who have sex with men) or heterosexual persons who themselves or whose sex partners have had more than one sex partner since their most recent HIV test." Pregnant women are also encouraged to get screened as part of their routine prenatal tests. The CDC doesn’t keep track of testing rates, but its website does link to Kaiser State Health Facts, a huge database supported by the Kaiser Family Foundation. According to that website, the testing figures for Oregon are slightly lower than what Keny-Guyer reported. Less than 37 percent of Oregonians between the ages of 18 and 64 have been tested for HIV. The national average is 40 percent. If you’re talking in the last year, the figures are even lower -- 18 percent in Oregon, 21.5 percent nationwide. The numbers were off slightly from what Keny-Guyer reported on the House floor, so we talked to an aide in her office to see if there was another source we weren’t considering. The aide told us that the representative used numbers from the previous year (2009 rather than 2010) and forwarded us the latest statistics -- the ones we’d already found. We wanted to do our due diligence, so we called up two additional organizations. Michael Kaplan, the executive director of Cascade AIDS project, said Kaiser’s site was the best he could come up with. "I couldn’t give you a better statistic than they have there," he said. Karynn Fish, a spokeswoman for the Oregon Health Authority, told us the same thing. Anything the state had, she said, would be older and less accurate. With that, we turn to our ruling. While speaking about a bill that seeks to raise the rate of HIV testing in Oregon, Keny-Guyer told colleagues that "only 41 percent of adults have ever been tested." The most recent statewide number is actually a bit lower -- 37 percent. But Keny-Guyer used a correct statistic, it was just a year old. We don't consider that significant enough to downgrade our ruling. We rate the statement True.	None	Alissa Keny-Guyer	None	None	None	2012-02-24T16:06:38	2012-02-21	['Oregon']
pomt-07979	Under federal law, Jared Loughner "would not have been able to buy a gun" had he been identified as mentally ill.	mostly true	/ohio/statements/2011/jan/20/sherrod-brown/sen-sherrod-brown-laments-system-failure-allowed-j/	Jared Loughner, the 22-year-old Tucson man accused of killing six people and injuring 13 others including Rep. Gabrielle Giffords, scared community college classmates even before his alleged rampage. He should have been diagnosed, treated and kept in a mental health institution as long as he was a danger to others, or so goes the national conversation. But that never happened. And the shameful irony is that under a bill that President George W. Bush signed, "if he had been identified with this mental illness, he would not have been able to buy this gun," U.S. Sen. Sherrod Brown said in a discussion of the mental health safety net during an appearance on MSNBC’s "Morning Joe" program. "I mean, the laws were there, but he fell through the system, he fell through the cracks, because he wasn’t identified because when he left the community college, nobody approached him, apparently." The system’s failure will be discussed by others for some time, but Brown, an Ohio Democrat, caught our attention for his other point on the Jan. 11 TV segment -- that "laws were there" already to prevent Loughner from buying a firearm, if only he had been diagnosed. So we checked with the FBI, the Brady Center to Prevent Gun Violence, the Ohio attorney general’s office, a group called Legal Community Against Violence and the Buckeye Firearms Association, a pro-Second Amendment group. There was no disagreement: A federal law passed in 1968 made it illegal to possess a firearm if you had been found by a court or legal authority to be a "mental defective." The prohibition also applied to anyone involuntarily committed to a mental institution. Enforcement was strengthened with the Brady Handgun Protection Act of 1993, which established the National Instant Criminal Background Check System, or NICS, to conduct electronic background checks when individuals purchase guns. Another measure, signed by President George W. Bush, improved the reporting system as it pertained to mental health issues after the Virginia Tech massacre in 2007. Individuals may be released from the federal gun ban if they have deemed rehabilitated and are discharged from all monitoring. Under Arizona law, it would not have been hard to get Loughner committed, according to reviews by news organizations. "Arizona has one of the least restrictive laws when it comes to detaining apparently mentally ill people against their will," Reuters, a wire service, reported on Jan. 13. "Under the state's broad involuntary-commitment statute, the government can mandate in-patient treatment for anyone determined to be ‘persistently or acutely disabled.’ That could include a broad range of seemingly troubled individuals." But the federal gun law has exceptions. The big one: Those who voluntarily get institutional treatment and bypass the need for court action aren’t barred from gun ownership, according to the groups with which we checked. That means that if community college officials, counselors or Loughner’s parents had convinced Loughner to check in on his own, he still would have qualified to buy a gun. "Just being mentally ill is not going to be the triggerer" for the prohibition, said Becca Knox, the Brady Center’s director of research. For reasons that most agree are good, this country doesn’t keep a registry on mental illness. Mental illness is stigmatized enough already, and the majority of people who seek treatment "will never commit a crime," said Jim Irvine, chairman of the Buckeye Firearms Association. "We have talked about this and looked at it, and none of us at Buckeye have come up with a good solution. I don’t know how you deal with it, because you will have problems on all sides." Yet there’s another problem, gun control advocates say. Some people who have been forced into psychiatric treatment by state courts -- and therefore have a record at the state level -- still don’t show up in the NICS system. Only 26 states have statutes authorizing or mandating that their mental health adjudications be sent to the federal system, according to the Legal Community Against Violence. Arizona does not have such a law, but it is one of nine states that provide the information to NICS anyway, said Robyn Thomas, executive director of Legal Community Against Violence. Ohio, too, provides the information voluntarily -- but it didn’t until the state passed a concealed carry law that took effect in 2004, according to Toby Hoover, executive director of the Ohio Coalition Against Gun Violence and a Brady Center board member. This was confirmed by Lisa Peterson Hackley, spokeswoman for Ohio Attorney General Mike DeWine. The bill that Bush signed provided financial incentives for all states to participate, but no federal laws make participation mandatory. So we come back to Brown’s claim that if Loughner "had been identified with this mental illness, he would not have been able to buy this gun." Brown’s statement was generally correct. We’ll concede that Brown was speaking as a guest on a fast-moving TV program where four other people were jumping in with opinions -- not exactly a forum for discussing the nuances of federal gun law. Nevertheless, his statement lacked the caveat that if Loughner had been diagnosed but had committed himself voluntarily and was not adjudicated by a court, he still could have bought a gun legally. That’s a point of clarification important for a full understanding of his statement. We rate his claim Mostly True. Comment on this item.

pomt-13898	Says Hillary Clinton "filibustered legislation to reform" Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/jun/28/donald-trump/trump-wrongly-says-clinton-filibustered-fannie-mae/	Responsibility for the 2008 housing crisis is at stake in a new attack launched by Donald Trump against Hillary Clinton. "Hillary Clinton filibustered legislation to reform Fannie and Freddie Mae – institutions at the center of the Great Recession – which have been funneling hundreds of thousands to Hillary Clinton's campaign and Foundation," a statement from the Trump campaign said on June 21. Republican changes to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac regulation never faced a cloture vote, the most clear-cut procedural sign that a filibuster has occurred. (The statement calls mistakenly calls them Fannie and Freddie Mae). Without a cloture vote, the question of whether the bill was filibustered becomes "a gray area," according to one expert in congressional use of the filibuster. If a filibuster did occur, it's even harder to say that Clinton was responsible. Trump’s statement presumably refers to a Republican-backed attempt in 2005 to bolster regulation of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, two huge government-backed mortgage finance companies. The Trump campaign did not respond to requests for comment, but the statement itself cited a CNBC opinion piece. The Federal Housing Enterprise Regulatory Reform Act of 2005 passed out of the Senate Committee on Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs on a party line vote. It was never brought before the full Senate. After the mortgage collapse revealed the vulnerability of America’s housing market, some pointed to the bill as evidence of Republican foresight and Democratic obstruction. Experts disagree on the role Fannie and Freddie played in causing the financial crisis, but they certainly experienced its results: billions were spent bailing out the companies. Republican Sen. Chuck Hagel of Nebraska introduced the bill, and every committee Republican voted to move it out of committee. The question, then, is why Republican leadership did not introduce it on the floor of the full Senate, where they also had a majority. One possibility is that they suspected that Senate Democrats, including Clinton, would oppose the bill as a bloc, as the Democrats on the committee had done. Democrats had enough votes to sustain a successful filibuster if they had wanted to, and the then-Senate minority leader Harry Reid expressed his opposition when the bill passed out of committee. Experts are divided on whether even an explicit threat of a filibuster by the majority should be counted as a use of the filibuster power. The only mention of a filibuster in contemporary coverage of the bill’s progress is a quote from Democratic Sen. Chris Dodd of Connecticut. "The word ‘filibuster’ is nowhere near the horizon," Dodd, a leading opponent of the bill, told reporters after the bill passed out of committee. Democratic and Republican senators both expressed optimism that a compromise version of the bill would go forward. Some accounts of the bill’s progress suggest that Dodd later blocked the bill by telling Sen. Richard Shelby, the head of the committee that passed the bill, that he planned to filibuster it. Democratic opposition was more widely expressed, but some Republican senators may have been reluctant as well. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac lobbied some Republican senators to oppose the bill, the Associated Press reported. Without a vote or a public statement, it is impossible to see where individual senators who did not vote on the bill in committee, like Clinton, stood on the issue. Clinton never voted or publicly took a position on the bill. In contemporary reporting about the bill’s progress, her name is not mentioned. Three political scientists we spoke to had different standards for determining when a filibuster occurred, but all agreed that without specific evidence that she took some action to block it, it did not make sense to say Clinton filibustered the bill. "In the absence of clear evidence, I’m not sure how you ascribe it to Hillary Clinton or any other Democrat," Sarah Binder, a professor of political science at George Washington University, said. Clinton’s campaigns and the Clinton Foundation have both taken large donations from Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac’s employees and an associated Political Action Committee. In 2008, Clinton was the fourth highest recipient of donations from Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac’s employees and PACs. Our ruling In an attempt to assign responsibility for the financial crisis to Clinton, Trump’s campaign accused her of filibustering legislation that would have changed how two government-backed mortgage giants were regulated. Republican leadership chose not to bring the bill before the whole Senate after it passed out of committee. It is possible that they thought Democratic senators would filibuster, but based on the evidence available, we found no evidence that Clinton herself took any action in relation to the bill. We rate this claim False. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/a6493279-98a7-436c-85c6-c0d1a1955bd5	None	Donald Trump	None	None	None	2016-06-28T16:47:44	2016-06-21	['Freddie_Mac', 'Fannie_Mae']
pomt-03056	On support for Common Core education standards	half flip	/georgia/statements/2013/oct/04/john-barge/candidate-barge-superintendent-barge-sometimes-dif/	State School Superintendent John Barge -- along with Dalton Mayor David Pennington -- has joined the race for governor, challenging GOP incumbent Nathan Deal. Barge is campaigning hard on what he knows best: education, which he sees as economic development. During his two-year tenure as the state’s schools chief, Barge has presided over implementation of the controversial Common Core standards in Georgia’s schools. As superintendent, Barge has supported the national standards despite opposition from some Republican lawmakers and tea party and advocacy groups. So when we saw Barge’s stance on Common Core posted on his campaign website, we were puzzled. In an item he wrote and posted Sept. 12, Barge says he wished Georgia would have realized that its existing educational standards were at the college and career-ready level, "rather than changing them for the second time in a few short years" and adopting Common Core. Had Barge moved away from his prior position of supporting the educational standards in hopes of appealing to a certain group of voters? We decided to do some research. In July 2010 the state Board of Education voted to have Georgia adhere to the Common Core standards. The standards are designed to better prepare students for college and careers, and they ensure that students in all states learn the same academic concepts in the same grades. Creating the standards was a national state-led effort championed by Republican Sonny Perdue when he was Georgia’s governor. And they rolled out in Georgia school districts during the 2012-2013 school year. With many people calling for Georgia to pull out of the national standards, Barge said in the website statement that a measured review of Common Core is necessary. "I definitely want to avoid the type of rushed, hasty and un-vetted decision that got us into this situation in the first place," he wrote. Our Atlanta Journal-Constitution colleagues covering the governor’s race also reviewed Barge’s statement and noted that Republican opposition to the standards has put Deal and Barge on the defensive. And a few days after Barge’s column caught the attention of the AJC, state Sen. Fran Millar -- a past chairman of the Senate’s Education Committee -- took to Facebook to air his feelings on the issue. "This reminds me of (Barge’s) flip flop on the charter school amendment. Ironic how his professional staff are all in favor of Common Core. Trying to get primary votes? So much for principles," Millar’s Facebook post said. We examined some of Barge’s comments about Common Core over the past few years. In discussing the shortfalls of the state’s integrated math curriculum last summer, Barge touted the upcoming Common Core implementation. "As we move to the Common Core Georgia Performance Standards, students will get the high-level skills in algebra and geometry necessary to be successful in college and careers," he said. In April 2012, Barge highlighted the standards as one initiative to help improve Georgia’s graduation rate. "The Common Core will toughen standards for our students and let us compare Georgia student achievements with students across the country," Barge wrote in an AJC op-ed. In September 2011, he highlighted the "consistent framework" Common Core would provide. We then reviewed Barge’s statements about Common Core before becoming state superintendent. In two posts from his "On the Campaign Trail with John Barge" blog, the-then candidate questioned Common Core’s rigor and alleged secrecy in developing the standards and the state’s rush to implement them. "I submit to you that it is not at all really about this phenomenal new curriculum that is the silver bullet fix for educating our children. It is about the current federal administration wanting to control the education of your children, including what goes into the textbooks," Barge wrote in a blog post titled "Common Core Standards - Why the Rush?" Barge also criticized Common Core’s connection to Race to the Top grant funds from the federal government, which included stipulations for implementing a merit pay system for teachers. In an interview with PolitiFact Georgia, Barge stood behind his Common Core record and comments. And, as he has previously done, noted that the standards were already approved for the state when he took office. Barge was elected as the state’s education chief in November 2010. Before that he was director of secondary curriculum and instruction for the Bartow County School System. "When Common Core came out we were all in shock. So no, I wasn’t for Common Core then, not because I didn’t think the standards were good, but I wasn’t for rolling them out on top of standards we had just implemented," Barge said. "Once I was elected and Common Core was already adopted and set for implementation, I didn’t want to pull back and put in place another set of standards on teachers. I’m not recommending any pullback from Common Core standards." The Georgia School Boards Association said Barge has remained consistent on his support for Common Core. The group noted that Barge inherited Common Core and has supported rigorous standards for Georgia We asked Millar, a Dunwoody Republican, whether Barge had flip-flopped on the issue. "No, I’d call it a lot of waffling," he said. "(Barge) initially said he was in favor. I think he wants to be to the right of Deal on this issue. These standards are not perfect, but it’s a way to try to improve things." So did Barge flip-flop on his Common Core position? Barge said himself that he was critical of Common Core before becoming superintendent but was more supportive after taking the job because the standards had already been adopted by the previous administration. He gets some credit for being put in a predetermined situation, but he did change his position on support for Common Core. We rate his position as a Half Flip.

pomt-09398	Florida's cost for the Medicaid expansion will be $1.6 billion a year or more.	half-true	/florida/statements/2010/mar/23/bill-mccollum/mccollum-cites-top-estimate-medicaid-expansion/	The day after Congress passed major health care reform, Florida Attorney General Bill McCollum said he would challenge the law's constitutionality in court, in part because of its expansion of Medicaid, a government-run health insurance program for the poor. The new law "manipulates the states into doing things that the states simply can't afford," McCollum said. He said that the new law would cost Florida at least $1.6 billion a year, and likely more. But it appears those numbers are based on reports that don't reflect the final version of the health care reform law. His numbers were first questioned by a news report from the Web site Health News Florida. "The AHCA folks, the Agency for Health Care Administration in Tallahassee, that pays out Medicaid, estimates that it will be at least $1.6 billion more a year in costs to the sate of Florida, just for what they do," McCollum said. We wanted to look into McCollum's numbers, and how the Medicaid expansion works. Medicaid is a joint state-federal, government-run health care program for the very poor. (Its cousin, Medicare, is for senior citizens of any income level.) To get into Medicaid, you have to be not only poor, but also disabled, elderly, pregnant or a child. The new law changes that, opening up Medicaid to all of the poor, setting the limit at people who make less than 133 percent of the federal poverty level. Currently, that means a single person who makes $14,404 or less, and a family of four that has income of less than $29,327. Medicaid is actually a voluntary program, so states do not have to participate. But all states do, because the federal government puts up much of the money for the program. In Florida, the federal government was scheduled to pick up 55 percent of the the tab for Medicaid this year. But thanks to the stimulus, the federal government picked up even more, paying for 68 percent of the program for this year and next. But even though the federal government is paying for the majority of the program, it still represents significant spending for the state of Florida. Medicaid here serves about 2.8 million people at a cost to the state of $19 billion. That's about 28 percent of the state's entire budget going to health care for the very poor -- a group that doesn't employ lobbyists or make many campaign contributions. McCollum is correct that the new law will cost the state money, but much of that cost will be shouldered by the federal government. The federal government plans to pick up 100 percent of the tab for the expansion of Medicaid for the first few years, but after that, the percentage declines. McCollum said during his press conference announcing the lawsuit that the $1.6 billion was based on modeling developed by Florida's Agency for Health Care Administration. But the agency based that analysis on older versions of the legislation that weren't as generous to the states as the version that actually became law. The agency released a new analysis that is based on the actual bill President Barack Obama signed on Tuesday. The newer report calculated that Florida's share of increased costs would range between $149 million in 2014 and $1.1 billion in 2019, significantly less than what McCollum said. In 2019, by the way, about 1.5 million people previously uninsured would be covered, according to the report. But it's still possible that Florida's contribution will be less than that. Congress is currently working on a reconciliation bill to modify the law Obama signed on; House Democrats demanded the bill with a number of changes as a condition for passing the bill Obama signed. We can't say for sure that the reconciliation bill will become law, but if it does, it could decrease states' Medicaid contributions even more because the federal government would pick up even more of the tab for the Medicaid expansion. Here's a chart that shows the difference in those potential contributions: Federal contribution, current law Federal contribution, with reconciliation 2014 100 percent 100 percent 2015 100 percent 100 percent 2016 100 percent 100 percent 2017 92 percent 95 percent 2018 91 percent 94 percent 2019 90 percent 93 percent AHCA said that the plan's cost of $1.1 billion could potentially grow to $1.6 billion in 2019. Spokesperson Tiffany Vause said the agency was working on a new estimate that would include another $300 million to pay for a required increase in payments to primary care physicians who see Medicaid patients, and another $100 million to $200 million for unspecified administrative costs that "will incur to implement and manage all aspects of the new regulations." The attorney general's office said they agreed with AHCA's conclusion. McCollum is also a Republican candidate for governor; his campaign staff referred the request to the attorney general's office because they said it was a matter of official state business Getting back to our ruling, McCollum said that it would cost Florida $1.6 billion or more to expand Medicaid. He is correct that Florida will have to pay more money into Medicaid to insure more of the poor. But the feds pick up most of the tab for the expansion in the early years, at a much lower cost than $1.6 billion. It only hits close to that top figure in 2019, and still have questions about the unspecified implementation costs. We find his claim Half True. Update: This report has been updated to include comment from the attorney general's office received after our original publication.

pomt-10667	"As governor, Mike Huckabee supported higher income taxes, sales taxes, gas taxes, grocery taxes, tobacco taxes, beer taxes, Internet taxes, nursing home bed taxes."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2007/dec/26/club-growth/he-supported-tax-hikes-to-balance-budget/	For months, the antitax group Club for Growth has been targeting Mike Huckabee for supporting tax hikes when he was governor of Arkansas. With just a week before the January 2008 Iowa caucuses, the group has bought $175,000 in air time for an ad that tries to use Huckabee's own words against him. The ad begins with images of Democratic congressional leaders and says that "to stop massive tax hikes, conservatives have to be united. But listen to Mike Huckabee, when he was Arkansas governor ..." It cuts to Huckabee giving a speech to the Arkansas Legislature in May 2003: "There's a lot of support for a tax at the wholesale level for tobacco, and that's fine with me. I will very happily sign that. Others have suggested a surcharge on the income tax. That's acceptable; I'm fine with that," he says. "Others have suggested perhaps a sales tax. That's fine. Yet others have suggested a hybrid that would collect some monies from any one or a combination of those various ideas, and if that's the plan that the House and Senate agree upon, then you will have nothing but my profound thanks." Words on the screen say "As governor, Mike Huckabee supported higher income taxes, sales taxes, gas taxes, grocery taxes, tobacco taxes, beer taxes, Internet taxes, nursing home bed taxes." The video has been cited by many Huckabee critics and was even used last week in a parody of Huckabee's Christmas ad. (It showed Huckabee in a red sweater in front of a Christmas tree, offering to raise taxes.) We have addressed some of the Club's attacks on Huckabee with our previous article "Taking stock of 'Tax-hike Mike,' " so here we will focus on the TV ad. To understand Huckabee's comments, it's important to include the context for his speech. He delivered the remarks during a 2003 special session that was called to balance the state's budget in the face of a projected shortfall of more than $60-million. Lawmakers were divided over how to make up the shortfall; some wanted to use tobacco taxes while others preferred increases to income or sales taxes. Huckabee said in the speech that the state had already cut $380-million from the budget and that tax increases were inevitable to pay for vital state services. "We're no longer talking about merely shaving some excess. We're talking about amputating valuable and vital limbs, if we don't come up with necessary funding to meet the needs of those who depend on it," Huckabee said. In the clip, Huckabee is trying to address the lack of consensus in the Legislature by indicating his willingness to be flexible and consider different types of tax increases. But the Club for Growth ad lacks that context. It uses 40 seconds of Huckabee's speech to suggest he supports "massive tax hikes." The Huckabee campaign has said he had little choice but to support a tax increase because Arkansas state law requires a balanced budget. "Unable to resort to deficit spending – as other candidates are able to do – the Arkansas Legislature was forced to raise taxes to pay for infrastructure repair, conservation efforts, court-mandated education expenditures, and unfunded federal mandates," his campaign said Dec. 26, 2007, in a statement. As for the specific taxes cited in the ad, the Club is correct that Huckabee supported increases in income taxes, sales taxes, gas taxes, tobacco taxes, Internet taxes and nursing home bed taxes. He also opposed the repeal of grocery and beer taxes, which the the Club says indicates he supported "higher taxes." Overall, we find the Club for Growth ad to be technically correct because Huckabee did support the tax hikes cited or opposed repeals of the others. But the ad is misleading because it takes his comments out of context given the financial crisis he was dealing with in Arkansas and the mandate to balance the budget. And so we find the Club's claim to be Half True.	None	Club for Growth	None	None	None	2007-12-26T00:00:00	2007-12-26	['Mike_Huckabee']
pomt-00124	Kathy Manning gave "nearly $1 million to liberals"	mostly false	/north-carolina/statements/2018/oct/26/ted-budd/budd-relies-mannings-husband-claim-about-her-donat/	Many political candidates try to portray their opponents as more radical than they really are. Republicans portray Democrats as left-wing and Democrats portray Republicans as right-wing. In North Carolina’s 13th Congressional District, incumbent Republican Ted Budd has accused Democrat Kathy Manning of being a "left-wing political insider" who was "hand-picked" by House minority leader Nancy Pelosi. Budd, a first-term congressman from Davie County, has focused on Manning’s donations to Democrats. He has accused Manning of donating "nearly $1 million" — but his claims have varied. In an interview for a McClatchy story published earlier this month, Budd said "nearly $1 million (of Manning’s money) has been given to Nancy Pelosi, Barbara Boxer, Dianne Feinstein." In the Spectrum News debate on Oct. 23, Budd said "Over the last 10 or so years, she and her husband donated nearly $1 million to Nancy Pelosi." And on Oct. 24, Budd announced his launch of a TV ad that on the screen accuses Manning of donating "nearly $1 million to liberals." The actors say she gave "big money" to Pelosi and Clinton. So which is it? The candidates’ math Has Manning given "nearly $1 million" to Pelosi? What about Pelosi, Boxer and Feinstein? Overall, has she donated nearly $1 million to liberals? PolitiFact reached out to the Budd campaign for clarification on the claim. Budd’s claim relies on donations from Manning’s husband, Randall Kaplan, to get to what they consider to be nearly $1 million. Together, they say Manning and Kaplan have given a combined $887,053 to liberal candidates and causes. Manning has given $307,428, they say, while Kaplan has given $579,625. Meanwhile, the Manning campaign says she’s given $256,550. And Manning’s campaign opposes the notion that she and Kaplan’s respective donations should be counted together. But we’ll get back to that later. What do campaign finance records show? What records show Donations are difficult to track to the exact dollar. Donors don’t always use the exact name when they sign a check — they may sometimes use a middle initial and sometimes not — and there’s sometimes more than one donor with the same name. But a PolitiFact review of donations on the Federal Election Commission website and data provided by OpenSecrets.org, run by a nonprofit that tracks money in politics, found that each of Budd’s claims falls short. To Pelosi specifically, FEC records show Manning and her husband have given a combined $3,000. Manning has given $1,500 — $1,000 in 2004 and $500 in 2002. Kaplan gave $1,000 in 2006 and $500 in 2002. To former Sen. Boxer and Sen. Feinstein, the couple has given a combined $2,250. Obviously, the couple’s donations to that trio of Democrats comes nowhere near $1 million. So what about total donations? The Center for Responsive Politics, which runs OpenSecrets.org, found that the couple has donated a combined $545,500 to federal candidates and political action committees. Manning has donated $196,950, while Kaplan has given $348,550. For donations to state-level candidates and committees, PolitiFact consulted the N.C. Board of Elections and Ethics Enforcement website. At the state level, the couple has donated a combined $224,021. Manning has given $46,796, while Kaplan has given $177,225. Separate donations Manning’s campaign opposes the notion that she and Kaplan’s respective donations should be counted together. Manning is successful independent of her husband and their political interests don’t always align, said Hailey Barringer, spokeswoman for Manning. Manning went to Harvard, then Michigan Law School and practiced immigration law in Greensboro before starting her own firm. In some cases, they’ve shared the same political goals. Each has donated thousands to national and state party organizations. Each donated to Gov. Roy Cooper, Attorney General Josh Stein and former U.S. Sen. Kay Hagan. But Kaplan has made donations to some candidates that Manning didn’t help and vice-versa. Candidates that got money from Kaplan but not Manning include congressional candidate Ryan Watts, former NC Senate leader Marc Basnight and former Lt. Gov. Walter Dalton. Candidates that got money from Manning but not Kaplan include U.S. Rep. Alma Adams and the late Republican U.S. Rep. Howard Coble. In total, the OpenSecrets.org and NC elections board data shows the couple has given a combined $769,521 in federal and state-level donations. Manning has given $243,746 and Kaplan has given $525,775. Our ruling Budd says Manning has given "nearly $1 million to liberals." That math relies on contributions by her husband. She hasn’t given anywhere close to that, doesn’t need to rely on her husband’s money to give to candidates, and their varied donations show they can have separate political interests. We rate this claim Mostly False. This story was produced by the North Carolina Fact-Checking Project, a partnership of McClatchy Carolinas, the Duke University Reporters’ Lab and PolitiFact. The NC Local News Lab Fund and the International Center for Journalists provide support for the project, which shares fact-checks with newsrooms statewide.

pomt-13944	Says the unemployment rate for African-American youths is 59 percent.	mostly false	/virginia/statements/2016/jun/20/donald-trump/trump-misleadingly-puts-black-youth-unemployment-r/	Donald Trump recently told Richmonders that he was amending his campaign theme, "Make America Great Again," to strike an inclusive note. "I’ve added a couple of things," he said during a June 11 rally at the Richmond Coliseum. "I’m adding ‘Make America Great Again,’ and I’m adding ‘For Everyone,’ because it’s really going to be for everyone. It’s not going to be for a group of people; it’s going to be for everyone. "If you look at what’s going on in this country, African-American youth is an example: 59 percent unemployment rate; 59 percent," Trump said. "If you look at what’s going on with Latinos, Hispanics - tremendous unemployment rates. You look at what’s going on with so many groups. We’re going to make it great for everyone. We’re going to bring jobs back to our country." The 59 percent unemployment rate for black youths caught our attention. We wondered if Trump, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, is right. The latest figures from the federal Bureau of Labor Statistics pegged the unemployment rate for blacks, ages 16 to 19, at 27.1 percent in May. So where did Trump come up with the eye-popping 59 percent? We can’t say with certainty, because Trump’s campaign, as usual, didn’t respond to our question. But Tara Sinclair, an economist at George Washington University, offered a clue. Sinclair told us Trump’s percentage probably comes from a Bureau of Labor Statistics statistic called the "employment-population ratio." This is a figure that gauges employed people, age 16 and older, as a percentage of the entire population of adults. In May, the bureau said the employment-population ratio for blacks ages 16 to 24 was 41.5 percent. Flipped over, that would mean that the unemployment ratio - although such a statistic is not published by the bureau - would be 58.5 percent. That’s pretty close to the 59 percent figure Trump cited, Sinclair noted. But there are differences between the ratio and the widely used unemployment rate, which Trump used in citing the percentage. The unemployment rate reflects the number of jobless people who are actively seeking work as a percentage of the available workforce - defined as those who have jobs or trying to find one. The May unemployment rate for blacks ages 16 to 24 was 18.7 percent. The rate for whites in the same age group was 9.1 percent. The employment-population ratio is a far broader measure that counts all civilians in its equation - even those who don’t work and aren’t looking for a job. In the 16- to 24-year-old category, it includes high school and college students who are not employed or seeking jobs. As we said, 58.5 percent of blacks in this age group weren’t working in May. That compares with 48.3 percent of whites. The percentages decrease as people get older. In other words, someone is far more likely to be working at 24 than he is at 16 or 17. A historic chart of the ratio shows that the percentage of blacks ages 16 to 24 who weren’t working from 2003 to 2007 hovered at 60 percent, roughly the same as today. In between, the percentage rose to nearly 70 percent in late 2010, during the aftermath of the Great Recession, and then slowly subsided. Roughly 40 percent of whites in the age group had jobs from 2003 to 2008. That dropped to about 50 percent in 2009 and has hovered around that point since. Our ruling Trump says the unemployment rate for black youths is 59 percent. The unemployment rate is a widely used term with a specific definition: It refers to the percentage of jobless people in the workforce who are actively seeking employment. In May, the unemployment rate for blacks ages 16 to 24 was 18.7 percent, or less than one-third of Trump’s claim. Trump’s campaign didn’t respond to our question about where the candidate got his 59 percent figure. But it appears likely it comes from a computation of all 16- to 24-year-old blacks who aren’t working and may not even want a job, including high school and college students. Clearly, black youths have a harder time finding work than whites. But Trump exaggerates the issue through his misleading use of statistics. We rate his statement Mostly False.

pomt-11416	"There are no provisions in here that substantially affect or advantage the big Wall Street bankers."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2018/mar/20/heidi-heitkamp/senate-banking-bill-win-advantage-wall-street/	The Senate just passed what may become the first rewrite of the financial reform law that followed the 2008 financial crisis, and lawmakers are sending mixed messages about its contents. U.S. Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., the bill’s biggest critic, described it as a gift to big banks. "Give me a break," Warren said in a floor speech. "This bill is about goosing the bottom line and executive bonuses at the banks that make up the top one half of 1 percent of banks in this country by size. The very tippy-top." Sen. Heidi Heitkamp, D-N.D., countered in an interview, "There are no provisions in here that substantially affect or advantage the big Wall Street bankers." So who’s right? There are a few provisions that affect the big banks, but Heitkamp has a point in saying they’re not as substantial as they may seem. Warren has a point that regulations on big banks could be relaxed, but she downplays the fact that the Federal Reserve will still have substantial powers to rein them in. Wall Street The financial reform law, called Dodd-Frank after its congressional sponsors, didn’t directly define Wall Street, but it did create regulations for banks of different asset sizes. The largest banks, those deemed "systemically important," were defined as those with assets above $50 billion. Some banks made the case, though, that even though they have more than $50 billion in assets, they’re not really "big banks." In an effort to lift the regulatory burden of those credit unions and community banks, the bill raises the threshold to $250 billion in assets. Banks like Citigroup, J.P. Morgan and Wells Fargo have well above $250 billion in assets, but experts fear that the little banks exempt from tough regulations aren’t so little anymore. Former U.S. Rep. Barney Frank, D-Mass., an architect of the original law, told us that $50 billion had been too low, but $250 billion went overboard. "My personal view was that it should have been $125 (billion)," Frank said. "But the importance of this bill is that it makes no changes to the most important pieces of Dodd-Frank. As far as the larger banks are concerned, they got none of what they were looking for." Jeremy Kress, a finance professor at the Ross School of Business and a former attorney at the Federal Reserve, agreed that some of the small banks aren’t so small. "While the affected regional banks, like SunTrust and Fifth Third, may not technically be ‘Wall Street,’ history suggests that banks of this size may be systemically important and should therefore be subject to heightened regulation," Kress said. Liquid assets and custodian banks There are provisions in the bill that directly affect banks with over $250 billion in assets. Heitkamp suggests these provisions aren’t substantial. Let’s take a look. Dodd-Frank mandated that banks hold a minimum amount of ready-to-sell assets, like cash or something easily redeemed for cash, which would provide a buffer in the case of a financial meltdown. This bill allows certain municipal bonds to count toward this stockpile. Experts fear these thinly traded, not very liquid bonds will make it easier for the bigger banks to satisfy liquidity requirements while taking on greater risk. The Wall Street Journal reported that provision was championed by Citigroup and other large banks. Dodd-Frank also mandated a ratio of bank asset size to capital (assets minus liabilities), as a safeguard against a financial crisis. This rewrite allows banks that are "predominantly engaged" in safeguarding a firm or a person’s financial assets (as opposed to lending) to exclude central bank deposits and be categorized as smaller banks. The definition fits three banks particularly well: the Bank of New York Mellon, State Street and Northern Trust. While not considered Wall Street banks, Bank of New York Mellon and State Street both qualify as global systemically important banks. And interpretation of the language may allow Citigroup and J.P. Morgan, which also perform custodial activities and have combined assets worth $4.4 trillion, to qualify for this exemption. The Congressional Budget Office estimated a 50 percent chance of such an interpretation. Stress tests Stress tests measure a bank’s ability to weather a potential economic crisis. Under this bill, banks with asset sizes between $50 billion and $100 billion will be exempt from these tests, while banks between $100 billion and $250 billion will be subject to "periodic," as opposed to annual, tests. Critics argue the language will allow the frequency of tests to decrease, although Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell said it would be the Fed’s intent to have "meaningful, strong, regular, periodic stress tests" for this asset size range. The two stress tests mandated by Dodd-Frank and the Federal Reserve carried out by the Fed would remain annual for banks with asset sizes above $250 billion, although stress tests carried out by banks on themselves would change from annual to periodic. Tailoring language One of the more subtle aspects of the bill is that big banks could ask for special consideration called "tailoring." The bill language says that the Federal Reserve "shall," rather than "may," tailor its rules based on the size, complexity and "other risk-related factors" of the banks. This won’t actually change much, as the Federal Reserve already tailors regulations to different banks. But critics fear mandating tailoring opens a door for Wall Street banks to challenge regulations. "While tailoring is a laudable goal, ‘risk-related factors’ is a legal landmine," Kress said. "It's the exact statutory language that MetLife cited last year when it won a court order overturning its designation as a systemically important firm." Our ruling Heitkamp said, "There are no provisions in here that substantially affect or advantage the big Wall Street bankers." The bill raises the bar of what is considered a big bank five-fold, which effectively relaxes the standards for large regional banks. Experts warn this also could open a door for bigger Wall Street bank giveaways. The bill also has a few provisions affecting banks above $250 billion in assets. However, the effects would largely depend on the Federal Reserve’s interpretation of the law. The biggest banks might be able to get relaxed regulations, but then again, they might not. Heitkamp is partially accurate but leaves out important details. We rate this statement Half True.

pomt-13932	"Because of Obamacare, you have so many part-time jobs."	false	/arizona/statements/2016/jun/22/donald-trump/donald-trump-wrongly-claims-there-are-more-part-ti/	Criticizing the Affordable Care Act, President Barack Obama’s signature health care law, remains a top talking point for Republicans. Donald Trump railed against the law at a June 18 rally in Phoenix, saying he would "terminate" the law completely. "Because of Obamacare, you have so many part-time jobs," Trump said. "Companies are taking people that have been with them 20 years and more, 'I'm sorry, I love you, you're great, I have to make you part-time...' They want to get away from those horrendous Obamacare rules and regulations." This is far from the first time PolitiFact has heard about the Affordable Care Act creating a glut of part-time jobs: In 2013, PolitiFact rated a claim False that "as a result of Obamacare, we are becoming something of a part-time employment country." That fact-check concluded that there is anectdotal evidence that some companies are or will reduce the hours of some employees. But those individual instances fail to make a case of moving to a "part-time employment country." In January 2015, Carl's Jr. CEO Andy Puzder said the Affordable Care Act has caused millions of full-time jobs to "become part-time." Hundreds of thousands of workers may have seen their hours cut, but millions couldn’t be substantiated. We rated it Half True. And in January 2016, Texas Sen. Ted Cruz called the health care law the nation's "biggest job-killer," forcing millions into part-time work. Government data showed no evidence of that. We rated it Pants on Fire! In this case, we wondered whether Trump’s version of this claim holds any merit. What the law requires While Trump did not respond to our request for comment, claims like these are usually rooted in the Affordable Care Act’s mandate that certain employers offer their employees health care or pay a penalty. According to the law, businesses with at least 50 employees are required to offer health care insurance to people who work 30 or more hours per week. Not doing so results in a financial penalty. Critics of the law say businesses may artificially keep employees under the 30-hour threshold so they can avoid the costs associated with providing them health care. Little to no evidence Is that happening? Anecdotally, there are examples critics of the law can point to. Some universities, for instance, have capped the number of hours a student can work on a university job below the Obamacare threshold. The trouble with this evidence, however, is it's unclear how many students or employees are affected. Or in the case of students, if they ever really were considered full time. In the macro, there is little evidence of a large-scale migration to part-time work. In April 2010, the first full month under the Affordable Care Act, there were almost 9.2 million part-time workers, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. BLS defines part-time as working 34 hours or less. Through May 2016, there are actually far fewer part-time workers, not more. According to BLS, there were 6.4 million part-time workers in May -- an almost 30 percent drop compared to April 2010. There also is still a decrease in part-time workers comparing the current figure to when the employer mandates under the health care law took effect, in January 2015 and January 2016, respectively. Now BLS data isn't perfect for answering this question. The BLS threshold in hours per week for "full-time" employment is different than it is for the Affordable Care Act. In addition, BLS counts someone who works two 20-hour-a-week part time jobs as one full-time worker. Both of these factors complicate any calculations using BLS data. But the data is largely corroborated by scientific research. An August 2015 study from the right-leaning American Enterprise Institute, for instance, concluded that there is no increase in part-time work because of the law. "There is little evidence that the ACA has caused the shift across hours categories, or led to an increase in part-time employment," the study concluded. "However, the ACA could cause a shift towards part-time work in the future as the mandate takes effect. " "The truth is, it doesn’t show up in the data yet," said co-author and American Enterprise Institute resident scholar Aparna Mathur. A January 2016 study published in Health Affairs, "Little Change Seen In Part-Time Employment As A Result Of The Affordable Care Act,"reached the same basic conclusion with the exception of a possible rise for people with little education and those between 60-64 years old. And whether it will ever show up in the data is debatable, according to Bowen Garrett, an economist at the Urban Institute, a Washington D.C. economic research non-profit. He argues in a February 2016 blog post that workers could be "equally influenced" by the Great Recession. "We’ve been in a labor market recovery. We’re not becoming a nation of part-time workers," Garrett said. Vanderbilt University public policy professor Carolyn Heinrich co-authored a study published in June 2016 looking at the Affordable Care Act’s effect on part-time workers who want to work full-time in the retail and food service sectors. The study uses Hawaii as a control group, noting that the state has required employers to provide health insurance to employees who work more than 20 hours per week since 1974. Based on the findings, the study estimates a 2 to 3 percent increase in part-time work associated with the Affordable Care Act. Trump’s "suggestion that many people previously had full-time jobs and have now been pushed into part-time jobs is also greatly exaggerated," Heinrich said. "The people who are working less since Obamacare were more likely to be working hours close to the 30-hour threshold (that defines full-time work under the ACA), or less than 40 hours per week." Our ruling Trump said, "Because of Obamacare, you have so many part-time jobs." While some research suggests a small uptick in the number of part-time jobs as a result of the Affordable Care Act, Trump’s claim goes too far. Neither the data nor the experts (on the right and left) say Trump’s claim is accurate. We rate Trump’s claim False. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/26f81290-72f4-4dea-ac40-ab595a476385	None	Donald Trump	None	None	None	2016-06-22T17:00:00	2016-06-18	['None']
pomt-02986	"Local law enforcement . . . will have access to the [Obamacare] Data Hub’s treasure trove of personal info."	false	/rhode-island/statements/2013/oct/20/evan-feinberg/activist-says-local-police-will-have-access-obamac/	Part of the campaign to thwart the Affordable Care Act, more commonly known as Obamacare, has involved discouraging people from signing up for health insurance, available for small businesses and individuals through federal and state marketplaces. One group behind the push is Generation Opportunity, which created the ads showing "Creepy Uncle Sam" poised to play doctor. Its president, Evan Feinberg, warned in an Oct. 1 commentary in The Providence Journal that people who sign up will become part of the Federal Data Services Hub, "an enormous database of every participant’s private medical records, tax and financial info, legal history, and other intimate information." "Local law enforcement, insurance companies, and innumerable federal agencies and low-level bureaucrats will have access to the Data Hub’s treasure trove of personal info," he said. It's not surprising that some of these people would have access to the data. After all, low-level bureaucrats are processing the application and you are, after all, buying insurance from an insurance company. But the part about local law enforcement caught our eye. Would signing up for Obamacare really give our local police the ability to know how much money we make, the terms of our divorce and when our Viagra prescription is due for refill? PolitiFact National examined an element of the question last May when Rep. Michele Bachmann, R-Minn., received a Pants On Fire for saying the IRS is going to be "in charge" of "a huge national database" on health care that will include Americans’ "personal, intimate, most close-to-the-vest secrets." PolitiFact found that the IRS isn't in charge and it's not a health care database. The hub pulls limited data from other agencies to verify eligibility and determine how much an individual will actually pay for an insurance plan on the exchanges. For example, the Social Security Administration is asked to verify a person's Social Security number. Immigration and Customs Enforcement is asked to verify immigration status. The IRS confirms financial data to see if a person is eligible for a subsidy. It's the same system that allows Medicaid and the Children's Health Insurance Program "to query the government databases used today in the eligibility processes for many state and federal programs," said Brian Cook, a spokesman for the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services. What kind of data does it collect? Rhode Island's marketplace, HealthSource RI, sent us a copy of the application form. It asks for a lot of financial information that, one would think, the data hub should be able to simply get from the IRS, such as how much money applicants have earned from investments, a pension or Social Security, or how much they are paying in alimony or student loans. (A shorter application is available for people who are not seeking a tax break to pay for their coverage.) The system doesn't ask for -- and the database doesn't collect -- a person's medical records. The only medical information sought is whether an applicant is blind, disabled and, if pregnant, the due date. The only legal history information is a question about whether applicants are in jail and, if so, when they expect to be released. So the "treasure trove" of information isn't as rich as Feinberg asserts. (The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services even insists that it's not a database, but we'll leave that for another fact check.) But the key question is whether local law enforcement would have access to the information. When we contacted Feinberg's office to ask for the source of that claim, spokesman David Pasch sent us to a section of the Federal Register that gives the government the right to release information to "any state or local governmental agency ... that has the authority to investigate potential fraud, waste or abuse" so such cases can be prosecuted. The federal rules do not give local law enforcement unfettered access to the database. When we raised the issue with Pasch, he acknowledged that the regulations didn't say that local police would have free access to the database and argued that Feinberg "did not say all contractors could look at whatever they want, whenever they want." We disagree. Saying that law enforcement will have access to a "treasure trove" of personal information suggests that police would have broad access to that information, not just basic facts that the government would give to law enforcement to conduct a fraud investigation. Patti Unruh, a spokeswoman for the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, said, "Local law enforcement would only receive access to personally identifiable information after submitting a specific request for such information to CMS and after CMS rigorously evaluated the request for information to ensure that it is legally permissible and is reasonably necessary to investigate, prosecute or combat fraud, waste or abuse." Our ruling Evan Feinberg of Generation Opportunity said, "Local law enforcement ... will have access to the Data Hub’s treasure trove of personal info" in a database with "private medical records, tax and financial info, legal history, and other intimate information." Not only is he making a huge stretch when he says the treasure trove includes private medical records and legal history -- with financial data, not so much -- he is stretching further to suggest that local police will have anything close to routine access to the data in the Hub. Thus, the contention that signing up for Obamacare will allow a prying police chief to view your latest mammogram is False.

pomt-00051	"Mayor Andrew Gillum says he’s indefinitely suspending his campaign for governor in light of a fatal shooting in Tallahassee at a yoga studio on Friday."	false	/facebook-fact-checks/statements/2018/nov/03/blog-posting/democratic-florida-gubernatorial-candidate-andrew-/	A viral blog post claims that Andrew Gillum, the mayor of Tallahassee and Democratic nominee in the Florida governor race is "indefinitely suspending his campaign for governor in light of a fatal shooting in Tallahassee at a yoga studio on Friday." The article, posted to the site The Grio on Nov. 3, notes Gillum’s response to Friday’s shooting. "I’m deeply appreciative of law enforcement's quick response to the shooting at the yoga facility in Tallahassee today. No act of gun violence is acceptable. I'm in close communication with law enforcement officials and will be returning to Tallahassee tonight," Gillum tweeted Friday night. This story was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The blog post does little to justify its misleading headline and lead paragraph. The Grio article doesn’t cite any source for Gillum’s announcement to suspend his campaign "indefinitely," but does outline what took place during Friday’s shooting where Scott Paul Beierle killed two people and wounded five in a yoga studio in Tallahassee before killing himself, according to the Guardian. The Grio post notes that the gunman "reportedly had a history of arrests for grabbing women," and links to a USA Today article published Nov. 3 that digs into Beierle’s background. Emails sent to The Grio Saturday all bounced back. An email sent to the author of the article and messages sent to Gillum’s campaign were not immediately returned. Gillum’s tweet from Friday is quoted in the article, along with remarks the Tallahassee Democrat reported he made near where the shooting occurred. The Grio’s post is similar to the Nov. 2 New York Daily News article with the headline, "Florida gubernatorial candidate Andrew Gillum suspends campaign after 2 dead in Tallahassee shooting." The Guardian wrote in its Nov. 3 article that Gillum "tweeted that he was leaving the campaign trail to return to Tallahassee." However, there’s no evidence that Gillum is "indefinitely suspending his campaign for governor" following Friday’s shooting like The Grio’s post claims. In fact, Gillum is still campaigning. On Saturday afternoon, Palm Beach Post political reporter George Bennett tweeted photos of Gillum at a Jimmy Buffett concert being held to garner support for Gillum and Sen. Bill Nelson. The concert in West Palm Beach was being held "to rally voters before Election Day on Tuesday," according to a Nov. 1 Miami Herald article announcing the concert. Bennett tweeted pictures of Gillum with Norman Lear and Nelson, noting that both Gillum and Nelson "went with the khaki/blue shirt combo" for the rally. Gillum also retweeted Bay News 9 and News 13 Florida capitol reporter Troy Kinsey’s Nov. 3 tweet that showed Gillum onstage speaking to the crowd in West Palm Beach. Similarly, the Orlando Sentinel reported Nov. 2 that Gillum was scheduled to join other politicians and celebrities at the University of Central Florida to rally students Saturday. In campaign press releases sent Saturday, Gillum’s campaign said campaign events would be taking place throughout the day. "On Saturday, November 3, the Gillum for Governor ‘Bring It Home’ bus tour will continue with stops across South and Central Florida. Virginia Governor Ralph Northam will campaign for Mayor Gillum in Lake Worth, followed by a "Get Out the Vote" event at UCF and concluding the day at a Jimmy Buffett GOTV concert in West Palm Beach," a campaign email sent at 12:06 a.m. on Nov. 3 said. According to the email, Gillum was scheduled to speak in both Orlando and West Palm Beach Saturday. Gillum’s campaign also touted endorsements from politicians and sent out notices about more campaign events in additional emails Saturday. A Nov. 3 Spectrum News 13 story also showed what Gillum was up to Saturday, with time stamped updates. Our Ruling A post from The Grio claimed that Gillum is "indefinitely suspending his campaign for governor in light of a fatal shooting in Tallahassee at a yoga studio on Friday." While Gillum did leave the campaign trail to return to Tallahassee and met with some of the victims, he is not ending his campaign for governor because of the shooting. We rate this claim False.

pomt-05478	"In 1993 the Republicans embraced a health platform that proudly features an individual mandate as its main component."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/apr/19/facebook-posts/facebook-post-says-republicans-embraced-individual/	We recently noticed a Facebook post that took Republicans to task for flip-flopping on the individual mandate, the key issue in the Supreme Court case on President Barack Obama's health care law. "In 1993 the Republicans embraced a health platform that proudly features an individual mandate as its main component," the Facebook post says. "(Newt) Gingrich argued for individual mandate in 2008. (Mitt) Romney urged Obama to embrace individual mandate in 2009. But now that it’s a Democratic health plan the Republicans want to vilify, decry, demonized this very thing that they invented." The post, by a group called Americans Against the Tea Party, includes photographs of four Republican senators from that era, with favorable quotes about the individual mandate, the requirement that individuals and families buy health insurance. The four senators pictured are John Chafee of Rhode Island, Robert Dole of Kansas, Kit Bond of Missouri and Don Nickles of Oklahoma. The post makes a number of claims, but we decided to focus on this one: "In 1993 the Republicans embraced a health platform that proudly features an individual mandate as its main component." That would be remarkable because the Republicans have focused much of their opposition on the mandate, portraying it as a dramatic expansion of government by bureaucracy-loving Democrats. To find out if that's true, we have to go back to the early 1990s, when President Bill Clinton was trying to get Congress to pass an overhaul of the health care system. Legislative proposals As we noted in an earlier item, the Clinton plan included a different kind of health insurance mandate -- one on employers requiring they provide coverage for their workers. That approach worried some Republicans and conservative Democrats, and some of the critics instead backed alternatives to the Clinton option. In 1993, Sen. John Chafee, R-R.I., introduced the Health Equity and Access Reform Today (HEART) Act of 1993, which included a requirement that individuals purchase health insurance. That provision was to take effect on Jan. 1, 2005 -- more than a decade after the bill would have been enacted. The bill never made it even to the hearing stage. But Chafee continued to push for an alternative to the Clinton option. In mid 1994, he and a fellow member of the Senate Finance Committee -- conservative Democrat John Breaux of Louisiana -- worked on a new version that also would have required all Americans to buy insurance. According to a New York Times account, the bill would have imposed an individual mandate in 2002 only if "other methods to spread health insurance had not led to either 95 percent or 96 percent of the American people's being insured." We did not find the Chafee-Breaux bill in the THOMAS database of congressional legislation, so it apparently did not receive a formal vote. (Clinton, it should be noted, also failed to win passage of his plan.) How widespread was Republican support? So yes, there was legislation that included a mandate -- a bill by Chafee and a subsequent proposal by Chafee and Breaux. But was the support extensive enough to say, as the Facebook post does, that "the Republicans embraced a health platform" that featured the individual mandate? The HEART Act attracted 19 Republicans as sponsors or co-sponsors, including Chafee, Bond and Dole, who was then the Senate minority leader, plus a number of ranking Republicans on Senate committees -- Mark Hatfield of Oregon (appropriations), Pete Domenici of New Mexico (budget), John Danforth of Missouri (commerce), Orrin Hatch of Utah (judiciary) and Nancy Landon Kassebaum of Kansas (labor and human resources). Nineteen Republicans is not a trivial number, and the fact that many members of the Senate Republican leadership signed on is noteworthy. Still, 19 represented less than half of the GOP conference at the time, and the list of co-sponsors includes many of the party’s moderates. The idea was less popular among conservatives in the party. For instance, Nickles, one of the four pictured in the Facebook post, was not a co-sponsor. The Times, in a June 23, 1994, story on the later Chafee effort, called it the "moderates’" proposal. The newspaper reported that Sen. Phil Gramm, R-Texas, one of the GOP’s leading conservatives, said that any plan that "got his support and that of most Republicans" would not "guarantee anything." And not having a guarantee of coverage would have meant not having an individual mandate. This jibes with the recollections of Gail Wilensky, a health care economist at Project HOPE, an international health foundation. Wilensky directed Medicare and Medicaid from 1990 to 1992 and served as a senior health adviser to President George H.W. Bush. "I do not remember Republicans, especially conservative Republicans, embracing individual mandates," Wilensky said. Did the Chafee proposal "proudly" feature the individual mandate "as its main component"? This part is doubtful. As indicated, the mandate didn't start until at least eight years years after enactment -- double the four-year lag in Obama’s law. And while Obama’s mandate is envisioned as a permanent feature of the law, the Chafee/Breaux version was seen as a tool that may never need to be used at all. It would only come into effect if other mechanisms failed to insure a target percentage of the U.S. population. As the Times reported, "Breaux said he believed that the individual mandate might never come into effect, because a commission to administer the plan would make regular recommendations on how to increase the number of Americans with health insurance. As a result, he said, it would not be necessary to rely on a mandate." Role reversal Further complicating the Facebook post’s one-sided story line is that some of the individual mandate’s biggest opposition at the same time came from … Democrats. "The idea of requiring people to buy their own health insurance drew criticism from liberal Democrats," the Times wrote. "Senator Paul Wellstone of Minnesota said it did little to help people who lacked the money for insurance. In the House, Representative Vic Fazio, the Californian who heads the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, sent a memorandum to other House Democrats today criticizing what he called the Republican idea of the individual mandate. Mr. Fazio urged Democrats to work against the individual mandate and in favor of a bill requiring employers to insure their workers. He said they would be rewarded in the November elections once voters saw that Republicans were more interested in helping business and the wealthy and were ‘selling out the middle class.’" All told, there’s "lots of hypocrisy to go around in terms of consistency of positions today with those of 20 years ago," said Mark V. Pauly, a professor of health care management at the Wharton School of Business who has informally provided advice on health care policy to the administrations of both Obama and George H.W. Bush. Our ruling It would be accurate to say that a number of Republicans -- including several high-profile senators -- supported a bill or a subsequent proposal that included an individual mandate provision. But the Facebook post exaggerates when it says that "the Republicans embraced" the idea, a phrasing that suggests widespread support inside the party. Less than half the Senate Republican conference went public in support of Chafee’s bill, most of them from the party’s more moderate wing. The Facebook post also stumbles when it says the proposals in question "proudly" featured the individual mandate "as its main component." The mandate was a mechanism that would have taken effect from eight to 11 years after enactment, and only if other policies failed to expand insurance coverage enough. Breaux, the bill’s co-sponsor, suggested that it may never need to be put into effect at all. On balance, we rate the claim Half True.

pomt-11293	Says North Korea has "agreed to denuclearization."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2018/apr/22/donald-trump/trump-wrongly-says-north-korea-has-agreed-denuclea/	President Donald Trump fired off a frustrated tweet about North Korea after a Sunday political news show. "Sleepy Eyes Chuck Todd of Fake News NBC just stated that we have given up so much in our negotiations with North Korea, and they have given up nothing. Wow, we haven’t given up anything and they have agreed to denuclearization (so great for World), site closure, and no more testing! See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com NBC Meet the Press host Todd drew Trump’s ire for saying that a more positive tone for negotiations was in the air, but not more than that. "We don’t have a release of any of those Americans that they’ve held captive," Todd said April 22. "We don’t have a pledge of denuclearization as the ultimate goal." See Figure 2 on PolitiFact.com Trump’s tweet insisted that North Korea indeed had agreed to denuclearization, so we looked at the record. In terms of what North Korea itself has said, Trump has gotten ahead of events. The North’s latest statement North Korea announced April 20 that it would shut down its northern nuclear test site. A translation of a broadcast from North Korea’s state news agency said North Korean President Kim Jong Un unveiled the decision at a Workers’ Party Central Committee meeting. "The northern nuclear test ground of the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea will be dismantled to transparently guarantee the discontinuance of the nuclear test," the newscaster said. Kim also reiterated the promise to conduct no weapon or missile tests while talks were under way. He added that tests were no longer needed because the country had met its goal of developing its weapons capability. Denuclearization talk So far, North Korea has yet to officially commit to scrapping its nuclear program. It has left it to other countries to put that possibility on the table. Most recently, South Korean President Moon Jae-in told dozens of South Korean media executives April 20 that North Korea was "expressing its commitment to complete denuclearization." Moon said North Korea is not demanding the withdrawal of American troops from bases in South Korea. That would be a significant shift, but as the Korean newspaper Dong-a Ilbo reported along with Moon’s comments, "there is still a considerable gap between Washington’s demand of the North’s denuclearization in a minimum period of time and Pyongyang’s calls for progressive and synchronous measures for denuclearization." Denuclearization has been in the air since Kim made a rare trip to Beijing to meet with Chinese President Xi Jinping. The official Chinese news service Xinhua reported March 28 that Kim said, "It is our consistent stand to be committed to denuclearization on the peninsula." Trump also tweeted about his Secretary of State nominee Mike Pompeo’s meeting with Kim. "Mike Pompeo met with Kim Jong Un in North Korea last week, Trump tweeted April 18. "Meeting went very smoothly and a good relationship was formed. Details of Summit are being worked out now. Denuclearization will be a great thing for World, but also for North Korea!" So, no direct statements from North Korea on denuclearization, but the word has been in play and not refuted by North Korea. Beware of shifting headlines The White House pointed to an opinion piece in the Washington Times as support for Trump’s latest statement. The April 19 headline said, "North Korea agrees to ‘complete denuclearization,’ says South." That op-ed cited an NBC News report that had the headline, "North Korea willing to accept 'complete denuclearization' without conditions, Moon says." The NBC News post repeated a Reuters report from April 19 that said, "South Korea's Moon says North seeking 'complete denuclearization'." In the nuances of diplomacy, the transition from "seeking" to "agrees to" is a big deal. "North Korea has agreed to talk about it (denuclearization), not to do it," said Frank Jannuzi, president of the Mansfield Foundation, a group that funds work on U.S.-Asian policy. Arkansas Republican Sen. Tom Cotton sounded unimpressed with what North Korea has promised so far, even with the closure of its test site. "I think this announcement on Friday is better than continued testing, but it's not much better than that," Cotton said on CBS’s Face the Nation April 22. "It's an easily reversible decision, and they made no announcement about their medium- or short- range ballistic missiles that threaten hundreds of thousands of Americans in Korea and Japan just like it threatens our allies there." South Korean skeptics of the North’s intentions have noted that denuclearization has been central in previous high-level negotiations without producing tangible results. Jannuzi said North Korea often speaks of denuclearization as the dying wish of Kim’s grandfather, Kim Il-sung. "They always said he wanted that the peninsula be denuclearized," Jannuzi said. "All we have from the North right now is basically what’s always been there." Our ruling Trump said that North Korea had agreed to denuclearization. While North Korea has promised to halt testing and close a weapons test site, it has not officially said that it is committed to denuclearization. Other leaders have made that statement on their behalf, and even in that case, the only promise is that they are willing to talk about reaching that point. That is not the same as agreeing to do it.

pomt-10396	Obama's plan to raise the capital gains tax "hurts the middle class."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/jun/11/republican-national-committee-republican/mostly-higher-incomes-pay-capital-gains-tax-/	In a new Web ad, the Republican National Committee attacks Sen. Barack Obama for his position on capital gains taxes. Obama advocates raising the long-term capital gains tax above its current 15 percent rate, a rate that is below most current income-tax rates. "After just three years in the Senate, Barack Obama demonstrates his poor grasp of basic economic principles," a narrator says. "While families face tough times his ideas to raise taxes are out of touch. His promise to nearly double the capital gains tax hurts the middle class," it states. The ad is right that Obama wants to raise the capital gains tax. He has said he wants to raise it as part of an overall strategy of asking wealthy people to pay more taxes. Depending on the circumstances, he would raise it no higher than 28 percent, the current rate for the top income-tax bracket. But would raising the capital gains tax hurt the middle class? We conclude the answer is largely no: Only a small percentage of middle-class taxpayers pay capital gains taxes, no more than 11 percent. On the other hand, among higher-income taxpayers, about 51 percent pay the capital gains taxes. Walk with us into a thicket of data from the Internal Revenue Service (C'mon ... It'll be fun!) and we'll show you how we came to these conclusions. We looked at data from 2005, the most recent year for which the IRS has released detailed data. First, we had to decide which taxpayers are "middle class." Based on the data brackets, we counted everyone who reported income of less than $200,000, which we think is fairly generous to the RNC's point. Two categories of income are subject to capital gains taxes: taxable net gains and capital gains distributions (typically profits from mutual funds that are not part of a retirement plan). A taxpayer can report income in one or both categories, although most file in the first category. We're counting both categories as different taxpayers because we can't know how many people report income in both categories. For this reason, our numbers are going to be slight overestimates. Again, this will favor the RNC's point. Next, we added up the number of taxpayers who reported income in those two categories, so we could find out how many taxpayers were subject to capital gains taxes in 2005. Among tax filers making $200,000 or less, about 14.3-million of 130.8-million filers reported income subject to capital gains taxes. That's about 11 percent. Among tax filers making more than $200,000, about 1.8-million of 3.6-million filers reported income subject to capital gains taxes. That's about 51 percent. So only 11 percent of what we're calling middle-class people report capital gains, while 51 percent of wealthier people report it. If we removed people reporting income of less than $25,000, that percent would drop to 8.5 percent. And if we also decided we were too generous with our definition of middle class, and only counted people making under $100,000, that percentage would drop further, to 6 percent. "The capital gains tax largely affects very high-income people," said Eric Toder, a tax policy expert with the Tax Policy Center, a joint project of the Brookings Institution and the Urban Institute in Washington, D.C., which both liberal and conservative economists consider credible. The ad then says the tax will hurt 100-million Americans who own stocks, a claim we looked at previously. We found that raising capital gains taxes would not directly affect most working people saving for retirement . Tax-exempt retirement accounts like 401(k)s and individual retirement accounts (IRAs) are not subject to capital gains taxes. Most home sales are not subject to the capital gains tax either, an issue we've written about previously . The ad says that Obama's plan to raise capital gains taxes "hurts the middle class," but it's hard to see how that's true of a tax that directly affects — at most — 11 percent of a very generous definition of the middle class. Are there a few middle-class people who pay the tax? Sure. But on the whole, capital gains taxes are disproportionately paid by higher-income brackets. We find the RNC's claim to be Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.

Given that Illinois remains embroiled in an unprecedented budget impasse that has caused the unpaid bill backlog to swell to nearly $12 billion, we checked into Mendoza’s claim to verify the $11 million figure. The comptroller’s statement also comes with a not-so-subtle implication that the governor himself authorized the $11 million in vehicle purchases, which we looked into as well. Checking the comptroller’s checkbook The Chicago-Sun Times first reported Mendoza’s office purchased a used 2016 Ford Explorer with about 16,500 miles from a central Illinois dealership to replace an old vehicle that was "in need of many expensive repairs before it would be safe to drive," according to spokesman Abdon Pallasch. One of the more notable parts from the comptroller's response was the amount of money state agencies have spent on vehicles during most of the budget stalemate. Jamey Dunn, deputy director of communications for the comptroller’s office, clarified that the last two years referred to in the press release are from January 2015 — when Rauner took office — to February 2017. Mendoza’s statement also notes all state vehicles are paid for with taxpayer dollars, including those purchased by "all the state agencies controlled by the Governor," which suggests the Rauner administration is responsible for all the vehicle spending by the various departments. In response to the comptroller’s statement, Rauner’s director of communications, Brad Hahn, said comparing the comptroller’s small fleet of vehicles to other larger, state agencies is "completely different." Mendoza is the keeper of the state’s checkbook and records of expenditures are readily available on the comptroller’s website. We used the comptroller’s Ledger database to search for expenditures on the official category of "passenger automobiles" by state agency as well as by month. In fiscal year 2015, state government spent $10.23 million on vehicles, with the Illinois State Police accounting for $6.1 million, or about 60 percent of the total. During the time Rauner was in office that fiscal year — between January and June 2015 — state spending on vehicles was $7.09 million. That includes lapse period spending, which allows state agencies to use the previous year’s spending authority to pay for that year’s bills during the first two months of the current fiscal year. According to the Department of Central Management Services, ISP purchased more than 100 vehicles in FY2015 as part of critical update to its fleet. About half of the total amount spent — $3.05 million — occurred under Rauner. However, Hahn said the governor doesn’t sign off on new cars bought by ISP or other state agencies. After Rauner took office in the second half of FY 2015, CMS spent more than $2.9 million, which was used to purchase vehicles for the departments of juvenile justice, corrections, human services and the Illinois Emergency Management Agency. Expenditures decreased significantly during fiscal year 2016 to $3.19 million. Eighty-six percent of that spending came from the Illinois State Toll Highway Authority, which purchased more than $2.3 million in vehicles in February 2016, the same month state procurement records show the agency awarded a contract for 63 light-duty trucks that were to be "outfitted with a wide array of emergency lighting, radios, arrow and/or message sign boards, lift gates, and other enhancements to meet the Tollway’s requirements." Spending in the current fiscal year totaled $1.8 million as of March, with the Illinois Department of Transportation purchasing more than $874,000 in vehicles and nearly $528,000 by the Secretary of State’s office. Kelsea Gurski, bureau chief of communication services for IDOT, said the department purchased 56 light-fleet vehicles such as sedans and minivans to update its existing, "depleted" fleet, but that the purchases did not increase the size of the fleet. "These purchases were part of a much-needed update to our agency’s depleted fleet; many of our older vehicles required repairs that exceeded their value or had rust-related damage that made them unsafe to drive," Gurski said. "IDOT’s light-fleet vehicles are used for transportation for technical staff to worksites, meetings, seminars and training." Added together, the total amount state government has spent on vehicles since Rauner has been in office and at the time of the comptroller’s statement is $11.91 million. Our rating After being criticized by the Illinois GOP for purchasing a $32,000 used SUV, Comptroller Susana Mendoza issued a statement noting the various offices of state government have purchased more than $11 million in vehicles since Rauner became governor in January 2015. A search of expenditures through the comptroller’s Ledger database shows state agencies have spent more than $11 million on cars during Rauner’s time in office and throughout much of the budget impasse. But after being attacked herself by the Illinois Republican Party, Mendoza incorrectly implies that Rauner had a direct role in the more than $11 million in vehicle purchases by the state government since he took office.

pomt-14794	Says there are "ample means" to "tell when someone is a Christian in the Middle East ... by name, by where they’re born, their birth certificates."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/dec/01/jeb-bush/identifying-middle-eastern-christians-can-be-harde/	Republican presidential candidate Jeb Bush has said the United States should give preference to Christians fleeing the bloodshed in the Middle East. While many Americans and lawmakers view Muslims with suspicion, Bush argued this should not impede providing shelter to people of various Christian sects. This raises the question of how resettlement workers would be able to verify that the person who claims to be a Christian actually is one. In an interview on radio station WGIR in New Hampshire, Bush said there are many telltale signs. "You can tell when someone is a Christian in the Middle East, I can promise you that," Bush said on NH Today. "By name, by where they’re born, their birth certificates. There are ample means by which to know this." We thought we’d explore the markers of Christian identity in the Middle East. The Bush campaign did not provide more details, so we turned to specialists in Middle Eastern religion and society. Lucas Van Rompay, a professor of religious studies at Duke University, said it would not be easy to tell. "Some Christians do have specifically Christian names, but many don’t," Van Rompay said. "In addition, the Qur’an knows the biblical names of Abraham, Joseph, Jesus, Mary, etc. so these names may be found among Muslims. The place where people are born may be relevant in some cases, such as some entirely Christian villages in northern Iraq, but most Christians live in cities or areas which have a mixed population." Father Patrick Ryan, a Jesuit priest and professor of religion and society at Fordham University echoed those points, noting that many Arabs deliberately choose "ambiguous names so you won’t be able to identify them religiously." Ryan added that whether a woman is veiled is also unreliable. "Many (non-Muslim) women in the Middle East cover their heads and necks," Ryan said. On the other hand, he noted that some Coptic Christians have distinctive tatoos. Many refugees do have their birth certificates, and ones from Syria list the person’s religion. Still, Van Rompay said truly verifying that a person is what he says he is can take a long time. Middle Eastern Christians tend to be well integrated into their communities. "Even sitting down with someone and having a conversation about some of the tenets of Christianity or some basic prayers (Our Father, the Creed) would be problematic," Van Rompay said. "Middle Eastern Christians are as diverse as Western Christians are, and some will be much more knowledgeable than others, and much more able to express themselves than others." Our ruling Bush said there are ample ways to determine if a Middle Eastern refugee is a Christian and suggested that names, birthplace and birth certificate would be key. The experts we reached agreed that there are many ways to verify that a person is a Christian, but they warned that it would be far more complicated than Bush presented. For many Christians, neither their names nor where they were born confirms their religion. A birth certificate could prove helpful, but if one doubted its authenticity, a more arduous verification task lies ahead. Based on what the experts said, Bush misrepresented the power of the indicators he mentioned and the effort needed to go beyond them. We rate this statement Half True.

pomt-04920	"Foreign Chinese prostitution money is allegedly behind the groups funding Congressman Scott DesJarlais's (TN-04) Republican Majority."	pants on fire!	/tennessee/statements/2012/aug/01/democratic-congressional-campaign-committee/desjarlais-taking-money-linked-chinese-prostitutio/	Fourth District Congressman Scott DesJarlais, a Jasper Republican who is expected to face Democratic state Sen. Eric Stewart on the November ballot, is already on the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee's target list in emailed press releases – many of them similar to criticism aimed at other Republican lawmakers elsewhere in the nation. Perhaps the most striking recent example is a missive earlier this summer that seeks to link DesJarlais' campaign financing to Chinese prostitution money. Says the opening paragraph: "Foreign Chinese prostitution money is allegedly behind the groups funding Congressman Scott DesJarlais's (TN-04) Republican Majority." Almost identical news releases – except for the names – were used by the DCCC against Republican U.S. Reps. Jim Renacci in Ohio and Sean Duffy in Wisconsin. Our Politifact colleagues in Ohio and Wisconsin have sized up the DCCC claims and given them a "Pants On Fire" rating. A Tennessee echo is in order. The DCCC contention rests on billionaire casino operator Sheldon Adelson, who has given a lot of money to Republican campaign funds that are supporting DesJarlais and other GOP congressmen. Adelson, meanwhile, is facing a lawsuit from a former employee that includes allegations that Adelson approved of prostitution at a casino in Macau, a former Portuguese colony near Hong Kong that is now part of China. The DCCC release cites media reports on the lawsuit contentions and a comment by Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., that Adelson is "injecting millions of dollars in Chinese 'foreign money' " by contributing to Republican campaigns. "What will Congressman Scott DesJarlais do when his Chinese prostitution money comes from billionaire Sheldon Adelson?" said Jesse Ferguson of DCCC in the release. "House Republicans like Congressman DesJarlais are fighting tirelessly to protect billionaires like Sheldon Adelson who make fortunes overseas and Adelson is now the largest single donor to Congressman DesJarlais's Republican Majority. It's past time for Congressman DesJarlais to reject the support of these groups funded by foreign money from a Chinese prostitution strategy." Here's what Politifact Ohio reported on the matter: "The DCCC release noted that Adelson and his wife gave $5 million to the Congressional Leadership Fund Super PAC, which is backed by House Speaker John Boehner and other GOP leaders. FEC records indicate that Super PAC hasn’t spent anything so far. "Adelson and his wife, Miriam, also gave more than $60,000 to the Republican counterpart of the DCCC, the National Republican Congressional Committee, during the past election cycle. "A spokesman for the Adelson’s company, Las Vegas Sands, issued a statement that said Adelson has always ‘maintained a strong policy against prostitution on our properties and any accusation to the contrary represents a blatant and reprehensible personal attack on Mr. Adelson’s character.’" In a July 9 interview with Forbes magazine, Adelson said there’s not a "shred of evidence" to back his former employee’s charges, and "says the fact that he and his wife (a physician who specializes in treating addiction) have given millions of dollars to set up clinics around the world to treat people with drug addictions (many of them prostitutes) makes the … claims even more preposterous." Adelson also told the publication that promoting prostitution could cost him his gaming licenses in Las Vegas, Singapore and Macau. Basically, then, the charge by a disgruntled former employee is adamantly denied by Adelson. DCCC has nonetheless seized upon the questionable claim, extrapolated and exaggerated it to taint all of Adelson's political donations with prostitution earnings. If stopped there, perhaps this could arguably fall into the realm of standard political hyperbole. But to carry that on down a convoluted line to Scott DesJarlais and talk about "his Chinese prostitution money?" Yep, that sounds like Pants On Fire to us, too.

pomt-04852	Rhode Island has "the most burdensome level of health-insurance mandates in the nation."	half-true	/rhode-island/statements/2012/aug/12/mike-stenhouse/ri-center-freedom-and-prosperity-ceo-mike-stenhous/	As part of its laundry list of what's wrong with Rhode Island, the Rhode Island Center for Freedom and Prosperity, a conservative think tank that focuses on tax policy and business climate, has a report card that gives the state poor grades on a variety of measures. Chief Executive Officer Mike Stenhouse, who formerly ran the Ocean State Policy Research Institute, invoked those comparisons in a July 29, 2012, Providence Journal commentary that urged residents to take action. He cited problems such as high unemployment, bad business climate, dangerously high pension liabilities. He also talked about health care, saying, "We have the most burdensome level of health-insurance mandates in the nation, yet the Chafee administration is pushing us towards even more government control of our personal health-care decisions." In his commentary, he didn't specify how he defined burdensome. But in a subsequent e-mail, he made it clear: "Given that we see mandates as burden, and given that R.I. has the highest number of mandates, yes, I stand by my quote that R.I. has the most burdensome level of health-insurance mandates." We know of several such mandates. They cover everything from expensive infertility treatments and hearing aids to Lyme disease treatment and wigs for people undergoing chemotherapy. We’re not going to weigh in on whether such mandates are burdensome or not. That’s a matter of opinion. But we can analyze how many health-care mandates we have in Rhode Island and how that compares nationally. As we found out, it depends on who is counting and how they do it. A question of categories The source for Stenhouse's assessment was a 50-page report, "Health Insurance Mandates in the States 2010," by the Council for Affordable Health Insurance, an association of insurance carriers. The report looked at 136 mandate categories in each state, from requirements that adopted children be covered by an insurance policy (44 states) to requirements that policies cover HIV testing and/or treatment (10 states). When we contacted the council, Victoria Craig Bunce, its research and policy director, said, "we send out data to the [state] each year and they review it for accuracy." The office of Rhode Island Health Insurance Commissioner Christopher Koller confirmed that it supplied data on the mandates to the council, and that it gave a positive response to 69 out of the 136 categories. But not everyone categorizes the mandates the same way. Koller's office sent us a May 2012 report done for his office by KeriAnn Wells, of the University of California at Berkeley. Part of the report documents 24 mandates in Rhode Island law, not 69. A comparison of the two reports revealed that the council’s number is higher because it uses more categories, such as listing mammograms and pap smears separately. The mandates on its list also include whether insurance plans must cover services from practitioners such as psychologists and nurse practitioners, and whether persons such as adopted children must be covered. The Wells list doesn't tally those categories. The advantage to using the council’s data is that it uses the same method for all the states, allowing a comparison across the country. According to the council’s count, Rhode Island ranks first with 69 mandates. Maryland is second with 67, followed by Minnesota, Texas and Connecticut. But then we found another source that gave a different story. The Blue Cross Blue Shield Association has its own 2011 state-by-state count of mandates. Its list indicates that Rhode Island is 17th, with 43 such mandates. In short, the ranking depends on who has done it. Proof of burden So are all these mandates burdensome, as Stenhouse says? Stenhouse explained in an e-mail that the mandates are a problem because "mandates generally raise the cost of health insurance products, making it less affordable for those who do pay. [It's] a cost burden for employers and consumers, both." In addition to increasing costs, "mandates also mean that some people will pay for insurance protection for services they would never utilize," he said in his e-mail. "In the end, we believe it is best if the consumer, not the government, chooses what coverage any specific individual should have." Karen Pollitz, senior fellow at the Kaiser Family Foundation, acknowledged that "every time health insurance covers more, it's going to cost more." "However, it's important to pool risks so we all pay the same when we're healthy and we all have the same protection when we get sick. But insurance doesn't do that today," she said. "There's a lot of cherry-picking going on" as companies try to sign up the healthiest customers, leaving the sick to buy policies that become disproportionately expensive. Mandates bring some equity to the system, she said. One final note: After our analysis of the 2010 CAHI report, Stenhouse sent us an updated mandates list from the organization. In its 2011 survey, Rhode Island was tied in the top spot with Virginia with 70 mandates each. Our ruling Mike Stenhouse of the Rhode Island Center for Freedom and Prosperity said Rhode Island has "the most burdensome level of health-insurance mandates in the nation." We'll leave it to others to decide whether laws requiring health insurers to cover things such as mental health problems, infertility and wigs for people who have lost their hair during chemotherapy create a burden Rhode Island needs to correct. Although Stenhouse cites a national study that lists Rhode Island as being in first place in 2010 -- and tied for first in 2011 -- a Blue Cross tally shows that Rhode Island is in 17th place, not even in the top third nationally. We rate his statement as Half True. (Get updates from PolitiFact Rhode Island on Twitter: @politifactri. To comment or offer your ruling, visit us on our PolitiFact Rhode Island Facebook page.)

pomt-01382	If Florida expanded Medicaid, "some studies indicate it would create about 120,000 jobs."	half-true	/florida/statements/2014/oct/15/charlie-crist/charlie-crist-says-medicaid-expansion-could-lead-1/	Democrat Charlie Crist has criticized Republican Gov. Rick Scott for the state’s failure to expand Medicaid. During the second governor’s debate, which was held on Oct. 15, 2014, at Broward College, Crist said of Medicaid expansion, "In addition to the $51 billion it would bring to the state over the next 10 years, some studies indicate it would create about 120,000 jobs. That's the right thing to do." That’s nearly double the number of new jobs that Crist cited this summer. If Florida expands Medicaid, would that lead to 120,000 more jobs? Studies about Medicaid and jobs Medicaid is a joint state and federal program aimed at providing health insurance to the very poor. The 2010 Affordable Care Act encourages states to expand eligibility, with the federal government paying 100 percent of the expansion for the first three years, declining to 90 percent in 2020 and beyond. The expansion would have led to 800,000 to 1 million additional Floridians signing up for Medicaid. (That’s mostly due to new Floridians who would be eligible and also because some who are already eligible but haven’t signed up would enroll for the program after publicity.) Scott initially opposed Medicaid expansion but switched his position in 2013 when he came out in support of it. But Scott didn’t lobby the GOP-led Legislature, which ultimately rejected the expansion. He hasn’t talked about it much on the campaign trail. Studies predicting job growth are based on the idea that as states expand Medicaid, new patients will access medical services they haven’t used in the past. Extra revenue will allow health care facilities to hire new workers. But the number of jobs predicted in each study varies depending upon the methodology. We only found one study that went as high as the 120,000 number Crist cited in the debate. And that study was conducted by a supporter of the expansion. Crist was citing the Florida Hospital Association’s 2013 analysis that predicts about 120,000 jobs. The association commissioned the study done by University of Florida researchers. During the debate, Crist didn’t specify any time frame. Direct jobs accounted for about one-third of the jobs, while the remainder included suppliers or secondary spending, such as when a doctor buys a new house or car. Other studies cited much lower figures for job growth. For example, Moody’s, a financial analysis firm that doesn’t have a position on the health care law, last year predicted Medicaid expansion would create 10,000 to 30,000 jobs over 10 years in Florida. The White House Council of Economic Advisers projected 63,800 jobs between 2014 and 2017 in Florida. That study was part of the Obama administration’s promotion of the Affordable Care Act. The White House study relies in part on the Oregon Health Insurance Experiment, in which some residents got Medicaid through a lottery. Research showed people in Medicaid got preventative tests such as mammograms, cholesterol screening and pap smears compared to the control group. The White House predicts that Medicaid expansion would allow tens of thousands of Floridians to get those preventative tests. Experts weigh in on studies So why the massive differences on the job predictions? The numbers vary based on different economic models used and other assumptions. PolitiFact Florida interviewed several experts on the studies after the first debate, held on Telemundo, when Crist made a similar claim about new jobs from expanding Medicaid. Dan White, the senior economist who authored the Moody’s study, said that the hospital association study appears to assume that everyone who signs up under the Medicaid expansion will generate new spending. But at least some of those people who would have signed up for Medicaid were already accessing some medical services -- albeit inefficiently in emergency rooms. "They are treating all the money coming into Medicaid expansion as new medical spending in Florida, but some of those people are already spending money," White said. "The crux of our analysis is shifting who is paying for it. It might be true that those people support 120,000 jobs, but maybe 10,000 to 30,000 are new jobs." Some experts on Medicaid expansion told PolitiFact Florida that an infusion of federal dollars for Medicaid expansion would lead to some job growth, but they questioned pinpointing a specific number. "Pumping federal dollars into the state is likely to be stimulative, but an exact job calculation (given the many concurrent policy changes) is difficult," Harvard professor of health economics Katherine Baicker told PolitiFact Florida. Michael Tanner, a health care expert at the libertarian Cato Institute, said it’s impossible to make a jobs prediction. "I would guess there would be some short-term employment gains, but the long term would be more problematic as bills become due," he said. "But even in the short term, I am skeptical of both the size and precision of this estimate." Though most of the experts we interviewed agreed that there would be some job growth, University of Chicago economist Casey B. Mulligan argues that increasing Medicaid will reduce employment because people will no longer need to work full-time to get health insurance. "Medicaid makes it less painful to have a low income, so people have less incentive to take actions to prevent their incomes from getting low," he previously told PolitiFact. "Not everyone acts that way, but enough do that a Medicaid expansion would depress employment nationally." Our ruling Crist said "some studies indicate" expanding Medicaid would "create about 120,000 jobs." Crist was referring to one study done for the Florida Hospital Association, a supporter of Medicaid expansion. That study predicted about 120,000 new jobs. There have been several studies that predict job growth related to Medicaid expansion, with one study putting the figure as low as 10,000 jobs. Crist cherry-picked the study with the highest statistic and omitted that it was done for an association that supports the expansion. Most economists and Medicaid experts say that it’s likely that the infusion of federal cash would lead to some jobs, but it is difficult to pinpoint the number. We rate this claim Half True.

pomt-13418	Says Ann Kirkpatrick walked out "on constituents when questioned" on the Affordable Care Act.	half-true	/arizona/statements/2016/sep/21/john-mccain/john-mccain-claims-democratic-challenger-walked-ou/	Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., won his Aug. 30 primary and has since shifted jabs to his Democratic challenger, U.S. Rep. Ann Kirkpatrick of Flagstaff, ahead of November’s general election. A recent political advertisement attempts to portray Kirkpatrick as dishonest -- noting that she mostly votes along party lines (a pro-McCain PAC made this same claim, we rated it Mostly True) -- and turned her back on the state. "Kirkpatrick betrayed Arizona on Obamacare, walking out on constituents when questioned about it," the ad, which was published Sept. 6, says, showing Kirkpatrick walking out of an Aug. 6, 2009, meeting in Holbrook, Ariz. We wondered -- did Kirkpatrick really walk out on constituents who had questions about the Affordable Care Act? The event in question was pegged as one of several "Chats with Ann." A press release before the event notes that these chats, held at Safeway grocery stores, were meant for people who wanted to "discuss their concerns and issues." McCain campaign spokeswoman Lorna Romero pointed out that Kirkpatrick said in a subsequent interview with the White Mountain Independent that the chat was to give folks a chance to talk about "health insurance reform and getting our economy back on track." But why did Kirkpatrick walk out? Politico reported that the event was overrun by protesters, noting that conservative interest groups had organized opposition to similar events across the country. Conservatives for Patients’ Rights, an anti-health care reform group, did have the Kirkpatrick’s event listed on their website. The same White Mountain Independent article also notes people were upset because "she wasn’t addressing the crowd as a whole." "Ann was trying to answer questions, and was shouted down," Kirkpatrick spokesman D.B. Mitchell said. We were unable to find a full video from the 2009 chat, but an extended clip does appear to show several people shouting. Other members of Congress faced similar disruptions across the country in August 2009. NPR reported that some congressional town halls ended in "fistfights, arrests, and even hospitalizations." The ad fails to mention that Kirkpatrick went back to Holbrook for a town hall meeting on health care a month later. "I think a key component is competitiveness and choice, but I also think we need to take personal responsibility for our health," Kirkpatrick said during the town hall. From The Associated Press: "Kirkpatrick returned to Holbrook weeks after she walked out of a one-on-one ‘Chat with Ann’ event at a local grocery store. Protesters had urged her to make it more of a public forum and called her a ‘nitwit’ as she left." Our ruling The ad claims, "Kirkpatrick betrayed Arizona on Obamacare, walking out on constituents when questioned about it." While Kirkpatrick did walk out of the Holbrook grocery store, the ad fails to mention the protesters -- and that she returned for a health care town hall a month later. On balance, we rate the ad’s claim Half True. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/01289094-4b0e-48d1-a2a4-2c778cdee694	None	John McCain	None	None	None	2016-09-21T12:00:00	2016-09-06	['None']
pomt-02583	On sharing power with Republicans	full flop	/virginia/statements/2014/jan/29/virginia-senate-democratic-caucus/senate-democrats-u-turn-power-sharing/	Democrats’ views on power sharing in the state Senate have come a long way. Each political party controls 20 seats in the state Senate, just like they did two years ago. But the the Democrats senators’ view has hardened now that they have the tie-breaking vote. Let’s go back to November 2011 elections when Republicans gained two Senate seats, splitting the partisan count in the chamber down the middle and setting the stage for GOP Lt. Gov. Bill Bolling to cast tie-breaking votes on legislation. A few weeks later, Republicans decreed that Bolling’s tie-breaking vote also applied to Senate rules and that with his support, they would they would push through a reorganization that would give the GOP chairmanship of all committees. Democrats protested, saying Bolling’s tie-breaking powers did not give him a say in establishing the internal rules of the Senate. Sen. Donald McEachin, D-Henrico, said "Bolling is not a member of the Senate," and unsuccessfully asked a judge to stop the reorganization. McEachin, the chairman of the chamber’s Democratic caucus, denounced the GOP’s reorganization as "an arrogant power grab." Sen. Richard L. Saslaw, a Fairfax County Democrat who stood to lose his post as majority leader, agreed. "Virginians elected 20 senators of each party, and it’s only right the power in the Senate is divided equally," Saslaw told the Richmond Times-Dispatch. "The Republicans are trying to overrule the will of the people and claim a majority they did not earn." On Jan. 11, 2012, Senate Republicans, with Bolling’s support, pushed through a resolution giving their party chairmanships of all the committees and majority membership on the major panels. The measure passed on a 21-20 vote. "It’s grossly unfair to the citizens of Virginia who voted for a 20-20 Senate," said Sen. John S. Edwards, D-Roanoke, according to the Richmond Times-Dispatch. "I think the citizens of Virginia want the Senate of Virginia to engage in a power-sharing agreement." But Republicans were not sympathetic. Sen. Tommy Norment, who was poised to become the new majority leader, said the reorganization was a "rearticulation of Senate rules" that the GOP found "appropriate." Now, let’s flash forward. In November 2013, Democrat Ralph Northam was elected lieutenant governor. And this Monday, Democrat Lynwood Lewis was declared the winner of a special election to take Northam’s seat in the Senate. On Tuesday, Lewis was sworn in, giving Democrats a 21-20 edge with Northam’s tie-breaking vote. That allowed the Democrats to push through their own reorganization on a series of 21-20 votes. Democrats gave themselves the leadership of all committees -- although it should be noted they agreed to share the chairmanship of the powerful Finance Committee with Republican Walter Stosch, a bipartisan gesture the GOP was unwilling to make two years ago. Echoing Republican actions of 2012, the Democrats gave themselves majorities on all committees but two: Local Government; and Rehabilitation and Social Services. Republicans, perhaps mindful of their actions two years ago, did not call on the Democrats to share power or contest the lieutenant governor’s right to break the tie votes. But they did complain about several new precedents the Democrats set, including one that would empower the Rules Committee to kill Senate bills that are "significantly amended" by the Republican-led House of Delegates. In the past, House amendments to Senate bills were considered by the full Senate. The Democrats’ reorganization plan was authored by McEachin -- the same person who called the GOP takeover two years ago "an arrogant power grab." McEachin said his change of view this year is rooted in the GOP’s actions two years ago. During debate, he frequently repeated Norment’s 2012 line about "a rearticulation of Senate rules." Saslaw, in a written statement after the vote, said time have changed. "We now have a majority and we have a responsibility to use that majority to work on the issues voters care about," he wrote. No doubt, the Senate Democrats have U-turned on power sharing. We rate it a "Full Flop." Correction: A comment made by Sen. Richard Saslaw was incorrectly attributed to Sen. Donald McEachin in an earlier version of this story. The attribution has been corrected in this updated post.

pomt-02929	Ken Cuccinelli would "take money away from public schools to fund private schools."	mostly false	/virginia/statements/2013/nov/01/terry-mcauliffe/mcauliffe-says-cuccinelli-would-use-public-school-/	Democratic gubernatorial nominee Terry McAuliffe says Ken Cuccinelli, his Republican rival, is no friend to public education. "On education, he’d take money away from public schools to fund private schools," the McAuliffe campaign says in a TV ad that began airing Oct. 16. The claim -- according to Josh Schwerin, a McAuliffe spokesman -- centers on Cuccinelli’s plan to empower parents whose children attend what the state deems to be a failing school. Under the proposal, a majority of parents could vote to change the leadership of such a school, close it, transform it to a charter school, or put their children in their choice of public or private schools. Cuccinelli would have the state compensate parents for additional costs they incurred by changing their child’s school. He would establish a scholarship fund for children who switched public schools. And he would seek legislation allowing Virginia to provide the parents with tax credits to defray tuition at nonsectarian, private schools. Cuccinelli also wants to offer the tax credits to failing-school parents who want to send their children to religious academies. This would require voters to approve what he called a "narrowly drafted" amendment to the state constitution, which bans state aid for K-12 sectarian education. Cuccinelli has not put a pricetag on the tax break. Anna Nix, a spokeswoman for the campaign, said the total cost would vary based on how many parents opt for the tax credit choice and how much it costs to educate a child in those private venues. McAuliffe's ad says the plan would force localities to raise property taxes to compensate for lost state aid to public schools. Seeking a bottom line, we came up with our own estimate of the cost of the tax credit. Cuccinelli would define a failing school as one that was denied state accreditation because of chronically low student achievement. There are six such schools this year: three in Norfolk, two in Petersburg and one in Alexandria. According to state Department of Education figures, total enrollment at those schools was 3,335 last school year. Based on per-pupil allocations to each of the cities housing a failing school, the state spent $16.9 million educating those students. So the maximum cost of the tax credit -- assuming every student at every failing school would up being privately educated -- would be about $16.9 million this year. That’s about three-tenths of 1 percent of the nearly $5.2 billion in general funds the state will spend on public education. Nix said Cuccinelli "will not touch education" to pay for the tax credit. But Democrats have long argued that it’s impossible to cut income taxes without affecting the long-term money available to public schools. That’s because income taxes are the largest revenue source for the state’s general fund -- now at $17.4 billion -- which pays for education, health programs and public safety. About 30 percent of the general fund is traditionally allocated for public education. Our ruling McAuliffe says Cuccinelli would "take away money from public schools to pay for private schools." Cuccinelli’s K-12 plan opens that possibility by proposing tax credits for the parents of children in failing public schools to defray their cost of switching to private education. The program, if passed by the General Assembly, would have enormous symbolic meaning because it would crack Virginia’s tradition of not directly aiding private schools. McAuliffe’s statement, however, lacks perspective. It doesn’t note that Cuccinelli’s program would be very small. This year, only six of Virginia’s 1,828 public schools are failing. They are attended by 3,335 of the state’s 1.27 million students. In the unlikely scenario that every failing-school parent switched their children to private schools, Cuccinelli’s tax credit would have cost about $16.9 million this year -- one-third of 1 percent of the state’s public education budget. Cuccinelli says he would not cut the K-12 budget to pay for his plan. But in the long run under other governors, the revenues available to fund public education would be reduced -- very marginally -- to support the private school tax break. So there’s a sliver of accuracy to McAuliffe’s statement, but it creates a misleading impression of Cuccinelli’s education platform. We rate the claim Mostly False.

pomt-07731	"Most federal employees do not have collective bargaining for benefits, nor for pay."	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/mar/02/scott-walker/wisconsin-gov-scott-walker-says-most-federal-emplo/	In an interview with Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker, NBC's Meet the Press host David Gregory zeroed in on the issue at the heart of the union showdown. "What's so wrong with...collective bargaining?" Gregory asked. Walker began with a comparison to federal employees. "Well, our proposal is less restrictive than the federal government is today," Walker said. "Under Barack Obama, he presides over a federal government where most federal employees do not have collective bargaining for benefits, nor for pay. So what we're asking for is something less restrictive than what the federal government has." Whether Walker's proposal is less restrictive than what the federal government has today is a matter of opinion (and we'll explain why later), but we were curious whether Walker's was correct that most of the roughly 2.8 million federal workers do not have collective bargaining rights to negotiate pay and health or pension benefits. We turned first to the American Federation of Government Employees (AFGE) which represents 600,000 federal government workers in 65 agencies, including the Department of Defense, Veterans Affairs, Social Security, and the Environmental Protection Agency. It is the largest federal employee union. It's true, said Beth Moten, legislative and political director for AFGE, that most federal employees don't have collective bargaining rights over pay and benefits. "So what's the point?" Moten asked. "Should employees in Wisconsin be treated as badly as federal employees are?" There are some exceptions to this rule. Air traffic controllers, for example, can bargain over wages under a 1996 law that granted full bargaining rights to a number of federal workers covered under the Federal Aviation Administration, said Kate Bronfenbrenner, a labor expert at Cornell University. Some also point to the U.S. Postal Service, which has nearly 600,000 career employees, most (but not all) of whom have collective bargaining rights for pay and benefits. But theirs is a somewhat different situation. Although the U.S. Postal Service reports to Congress, it is an independent agency of the United States government. Unlike the private sector, explained U.S. Postal Service spokesman Mark Saunders, postal employees cannot strike, nor can management lock them out. Walker said "most" federal employees. And by that measure, he is correct, Bronfenbrenner said. "Unlike all the other state, county and municipal workers in the country who have collective bargaining rights, federal workers have their pay and benefits set by Congress," Brofenbrenner said. "But federal workers can bargain over terms and conditions of employment besides pay and benefits. "This has not created stable labor relations in the public sector by any means," she said. "Instead it has meant that senators and congressional representatives with large numbers of federal employees in their districts end up fighting to have money put into bills for federal workers in their districts the same as if they were lobbying to get money for a large federal contract. Thus, instead of being done in the very open transparent process of state and local public sector bargaining it is all done at a higher level, mostly behind closed doors, but the money still is getting there, just not as equitably as it would if there were collective bargaining." Moten, of the American Federation of Government Employees, also stressed that federal employees do have collective bargaining rights over working conditions. And that's an important right. It affects vacation time, work hours, safety issues -- all sorts of things important to workers. Under Gov. Walker's plan, collective bargaining for state workers would be limited to base pay rate (and raises would generally be limited by the rate of inflation). In a fact-check our colleagues at PolitiFact Wisconsin did regarding limiting labor negotiations to only wages, they quoted Candice Owley, president Wisconsin Federation of Nurses and Health Professionals, who said wages are only part of what’s important to nurses when they negotiate with hospitals. "We spend very little time these days on wages and a whole lot of time on working conditions," she said, such as seniority, schedules, the length of shifts, and what happens when a nurse is assigned to a different department. Said Owley: "We bargain every kind of working condition imaginable." Bottom line, negotiations over working conditions are important, and so Walker's larger point -- that he is asking for "something less restrictive than what the federal government has" -- is debatable. But in saying that most federal workers don't have collective bargaining rights to benefits and pay, though, Walker is accurate. Although there are some federal workers who have collective bargaining rights for benefits and pay, "most" do not. And so we rate his comment True.

pomt-12853	Says North Carolina gives taxpayer dollars to private schools, but "we really don’t know what these schools are doing or how they are performing."	half-true	/north-carolina/statements/2017/feb/02/roy-cooper/nc-gov-roy-cooper-says-private-school-vouchers-lac/	North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper says that even though the state gives millions of dollars to hundreds of private schools, it has no sense of how students at those schools are performing. And the day lawmakers returned to Raleigh to start crafting the state budget, Cooper said he would like to see funding for private school vouchers re-routed to public schools. "I am very concerned and have opposed vouchers because of the lack of accountability," Cooper said at a breakfast with education leaders Wednesday. "We really don’t know what these schools are doing or how they are performing. Instead, we need to invest in our public schools." The state began offering "Opportunity Scholarships" for families to leave public schools for private schools in 2014. In this school year North Carolina will spend $45 million on the program. Legislators plan to triple that in the next decade, to $145 million by 2027. The state’s public school budget in 2015-16, for comparison, was $8.9 billion. Cooper was critical of vouchers throughout his campaign for governor. And he was endorsed by the powerful teachers group N.C. Association of Educators, which also opposes vouchers. But vouchers are popular with supporters of the school choice movement and with Republican politicians, who have the final say in the state budget. What are vouchers? North Carolina allows qualifying parents to receive up to $4,200 annually in state funds per child for private school tuition. It’s one of 13 states (and the District of Columbia) with such a program. Qualifications include being disabled, being from a low-income family, living in a foster home or having a parent in the military. Supporters say it gives many students an option that was previously reserved for wealthier families. Critics question its accountability, or point to the many religious schools that receive taxpayer dollars (which was found constitutional by the U.S. Supreme Court in 2002). In North Carolina last year, more than 90 percent of voucher money went to Christian or Islamic schools. Regulations and accountability Darrell Allison, president of the pro-voucher Parents For Educational Freedom in North Carolina, said Cooper is wrong. "When you hear critics say ‘They don’t have accountability; they don’t have testing,’ what they're really saying is ‘They don’t have the same accountability and testing,’" Allison said. An expert in education policy agreed with him, at least in part. "There is some accountability attached to the opportunity scholarship program," said UNC-Chapel Hill professor Eric Houck. For instance, every voucher student has to take a standardized test and have the results reported to the state. But Houck said Cooper also has a good argument in his favor, in part because the overall results don’t have to be made public – and many of the traditional accountability measures on public schools don’t apply to voucher schools. "Accountability is a big word," Houck said. "If the governor is talking about accountability in the way that the General Assembly has been talking about accountability since the 1980s, he's right. But there are other ways of defining accountability." Accountability was one factor in a North Carolina Supreme Court case that challenged the constitutionality of the voucher program. The plaintiffs in the case, arguing against vouchers, made a claim similar to the one Cooper is making now. They were backed up by a group of education scholars who filed a brief saying the voucher program "has virtually no accountability system whatsoever." However, the Supreme Court was not swayed by those and other arguments and allowed vouchers to continue. So let’s look at the program as it stands now. Testing Public schools must use standardized tests to gauge if students are at grade level. Private schools only have to give standardized tests to students attending on vouchers. They also must use a nationally standardized test, not a state test. Allison said the state will use the results to measure academic gains or losses of voucher students compared to students from similar backgrounds in public schools. But Houck said due to the differences between the tests we’ll eventually know how voucher students compare to their peers in other states, but not whether they’re reading at North Carolina’s definition of grade level or know the content required of public school students. Performance data The test results must be sent to the state. A legislative committee must then use the data to make recommendations "regarding improving administration and accountability." But the results aren’t automatically made public, as public schools’ test results are. And furthermore the oversight committee isn’t expected to give the General Assembly its 2015-16 report until this fall, Allison said. By that time the legislature will already have approved the state budget for the next two years. So Cooper is correct that state leaders don’t have performance data. It’s also worth noting the data for these few hundred private schools is lagging behind the state’s thousands of public schools, which published their 2015-16 testing data in November 2016. Comparing schools While the statewide data isn’t public, some of the largest individual recipients of vouchers will have to make their performance results public. But the law applies an enrollment cutoff that meant, in 2015-16, that more than 90 percent of the schools were exempt. The opposite is true of the public school system, where almost every school makes its results public. Allison said the cutoff that keeps most individual schools’ results secret is in place to keep from releasing information that might identify individual students. However, public schools use a cutoff of 5 students, while voucher schools use a cutoff of 25. In terms of non-academic accountability, voucher schools also fall short of public schools in several ways. Only three schools that received vouchers in 2015-16 received enough to trigger a financial review. The hundreds of other, unaudited schools accounted for 95 percent of the $25 million spent that year. Public schools also have stricter measures for how much education teachers must have, and for conducting employee background checks. And that’s despite the fact that North Carolina’s public schools received an "F" in a 2016 USA Today report on teacher background checks. Our ruling Cooper said, regarding private schools receiving public funds, "we really don’t know what these schools are doing or how they are performing." While private schools do have much less oversight and accountability than public schools, it isn’t entirely lacking. Schools do have to give voucher students standardized tests and report the results to the state for oversight. But there are many areas in which voucher recipients don’t face the same oversight and public reporting requirements as public schools, or have a lesser standard. We rate this claim Half True. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/088bcd03-e7cf-4e20-9c7d-690b64ce562e	None	Roy Cooper	None	None	None	2017-02-02T15:16:29	2017-01-25	['None']
pomt-13335	Says Philando Castile "had been stopped by police 40 or 50 times before that fatal incident."	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/oct/05/tim-kaine/kaine-police-stopped-slain-minnesota-driver-over-4/	Republican Mike Pence and Democrat Tim Kaine brought the tense intersection of law enforcement and race into the center of the vice presidential debate. Kaine accused Pence of being afraid to confront the issue of bias in police, but Pence denied that he was afraid. Kaine pressed the issue with the story of Philando Castile, the Minnesota man shot to death by a police officer during a traffic stop for a broken tail light. The gruesome incident was streamed live on a Facebook video by Castile’s girlfriend. "They called him Mr. Rogers with Dreadlocks in the school that he worked," Kaine said. "The kids loved him. But he had been stopped by police 40 or 50 times before that fatal incident. And if you look at sentencing in this country, African-Americans and Latinos get sentenced for the same crimes at very different rates." We know the larger point Kaine was making and we’ve checked that before (True). But we wanted to vet his number for how many times police stopped Castille. According to the Associated Press, Kaine is correct. The AP reported on June 9, 2016, that Castile "had been pulled over at least 52 times in recent years in and around the Twin Cities and given citations for minor offenses including speeding, driving without a muffler and not wearing a seat belt." The report also found that about half of the charges against Castile had been dismissed. A similar investigation by NPR found 46 stops. And NPR noted "Of all of the stops, only six of them were things a police officer would notice from outside a car — things like speeding or having a broken muffler." Minnesota offers a rare glimpse into broader patterns of law enforcement and race. In 2001, the Legislature commissioned a study by the Institute on Race and Poverty, a center overseen by a University of Minnesota law professor. That study ultimately included 65 jurisdictions. The results published in 2003 showed several disturbing patterns. Law enforcement officers stopped black, Latino, and American Indian drivers at greater rates than whites, searched them at greater rates than whites, but the rate of actually finding illegal goods was less for minorities than for whites. In a press release, the lead study director Gavin Kearney said, "The pattern for blacks and Latinos existed in nearly every participating jurisdiction." Shortly before Castile was shot, he had told the officer that he had a permit to carry a weapon. Our ruling Kaine said Castile was stopped by police 40 or 50 times before the time when he was fatally wounded. According to multiple independent press reports, that is accurate. Police had stopped Castile at least 46 times. A study commissioned by the state legislature found that local police were more likely to stop and search minority drivers. We rate the claim True. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/fea7f5b7-a00f-4b1f-a9d7-1b27fc60eda0	None	Tim Kaine	None	None	None	2016-10-05T01:08:57	2016-10-04	['None']
pomt-07583	Says a Lubbock terror suspect’s alleged plan "to use baby dolls to conceal chemical explosives" is similar to a 1995 plot "to blow up 12 jumbo jets over the Pacific Ocean."	true	/texas/statements/2011/mar/28/michael-mccaul/us-rep-michael-mccaul-says-khalid-ali-m-aldawsari-/	Shortly after a Saudi man who attended college in Lubbock was accused of attempting "to use a weapon of mass destruction," U.S. Rep. Michael McCaul, R-Austin, issued a statement about his "likely" connection to an international terrorist network. Khalid Ali-M Aldawsari’s "intent to use baby dolls to conceal chemical explosives is a rare, little-known method used by Khalid Shaikh Mohammed and Ramzi Yousef in the 1995 Bojinka plot in which they planned to blow up 12 jumbo jets over the Pacific Ocean," McCaul, a member of the House Committee on Homeland Security, said in his Feb. 28 statement. We won’t rule on Aldawsari’s intent or his guilt — that’s for the court to decide. But we wondered about McCaul’s statement that baby dolls figured into both his case, and the 1995 plot linked to Mohammed, who has described himself as the mastermind of the 9/11 attacks, and Yousef, convicted in the 1993 World Trade Center bombing. First, some background on the Aldawsari case: Federal agents arrested the 20-year-old former Texas Tech chemical engineering student on Feb. 23 after a search of his home and computer. According to an Associated Press story, federal authorities said he had purchased explosive materials online and planned to hide them in dolls and baby carriages to blow up dams, nuclear plants and former President George W. Bush's Dallas home. Aldawsari was indicted in federal court on March 9 and if convicted, could be sentenced to life in prison and fined $250,000, according to the AP. He plans to plead not guilty, according to a Feb. 25 New York Times article quoting his lawyer, Rod Hobson. Hobson did not respond to our queries. Responding to our request for more information about the congressman’s claim, McCaul spokesman Mike Rosen sent us a Feb. 23 affidavit submitted by FBI agent Michael Orndorff to secure the arrest warrant for Aldawsari. According to the affidavit, the FBI launched its investigation after the Carolina Biological Supply in North Carolina, suspicious about an attempted purchase of chemicals by Aldawsari, reported him Feb. 1. According to the affidavit, Aldawsari had "made numerous Internet searches related to infants and babies. He viewed photos of realistic-looking newborn and infant dolls. In addition, numerous websites were viewed that are related to baby accessories, including strollers, baby clothes and diapers. Aldawsari also viewed doll photos that appeared to be altered in the neck area, with what may have been a pipe and wires visible." Based on his "training and experience," Orndorff says in the affidavit that he "believes this web activity could indicate Aldawsari’s consideration of the use of a realistic doll to conceal explosives or other weapons." Under a section titled "research of targets by Aldawsari," the affidavit says that on Feb. 6, he e-mailed himself Bush’s Dallas address with the subject line: "tyrant’s house." We contacted the Justice Department for more information about the Aldawsari case. Dean Boyd, a spokesman for the national security division, told us that the agency couldn’t talk to the media about it because the federal judge presiding over the case had issued a gag order. What about the 1995 terrorist plot that McCaul referenced? Did Mohammed and Yousef plan to use baby dolls packed with explosives to blow up planes? Rosen told us that he didn’t have documentation for that part of McCaul’s statement but that McCaul learned about the doll plan while he was serving as chief of counterterrorism in the U.S. Attorney’s office in the Western District of Texas prior to joining Congress. Separately, we found a September 1996 Los Angeles Times news article reporting that a federal jury had found Yousef and two co-defendants guilty of planning to blow up 12 U.S. jetliners over the Pacific. According to a 2006 New York Times story, Yousef worked with Mohammed, his uncle, to hatch the plot. The Times story says: "Mohammed code-named the operation Bojinka, which was widely reported to have been adopted from Serbo-Croatian, meaning big bang. But Mr. Mohammed has told his CIA interrogators interrogators that it was just a ‘nonsense word’ he adopted after hearing it when he was fighting in Afghanistan during the war against the Soviet Union, according to the 9/11 Commission Report." Next, we consulted Stratfor, an Austin-based global intelligence company. According to a September 2009 article on aviation security by Stratfor Vice President Scott Stewart, the Bojinka plot involved using baby dolls to smuggle explosives onto the planes. The article says: "The baby-doll device was successfully smuggled past security (in Manila, Philippines) in a test run in December 1993 and was detonated aboard Philippine Air Flight 434," although it failed to bring the plane down. The Bojinka plot unraveled when Yousef accidentally set his apartment on fire while making another bomb, the Stratfor article says. In a Feb. 24 report, Stratfor said accounts that Aldawsari had "images of dolls apparently manipulated into (explosive devices)" on his computer hearkens back to Yousef’s attempt to use dolls in the Bojinka plot. Fred Burton, Stratfor’s vice president for intelligence, was involved in Yousef’s 1995 arrest in Pakistan as a special agent for the U.S. State Department. In a Sept. 17 Web video posted on YouTube, Burton says: "We were able to go in and capture Ramzi Yousef at a hotel and recover a whole bunch of improvised explosive devices that had been made to look like baby doll bombs that he intended to use to blow up airplanes around the world." Yousef is serving a life sentence in maximum-security prison in Colorado, according to the Federal Bureau of Prisons. Mohammed has been held in the U.S. military prison in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, for four 1/2 years, according to a list of detainees on the New York Times. Summing up: An FBI investigation suggests that Aldawsari could have been considering using a doll to conceal explosives in attacks on U.S. targets, including Bush’s Dallas home. Other reports also indicate that Mohammed and Yousef planned to use baby dolls to conceal explosives in a 1995 plot. We rate McCaul’s statement as True.

pomt-14010	Says he never told anyone he hated the U.S. Senate.	mostly true	/florida/statements/2016/jun/03/marco-rubio/marco-rubio-didnt-say-he-hated-us-senate-was-defin/	Marco Rubio has yet to bow to pressure to reconsider his decision against seeking re-election to the U.S. Senate. But he is pushing back hard against the suggestion that he didn’t like his job in the upper house of Congress. "Flashback to another article quoting a ‘longtime friend’ saying I ‘hate’ Senate. Words I have NEVER said to anyone," Rubio tweeted on May 16, 2016. The tweet linked to a Washington Post article put online on Oct. 25, 2015, that quoted an anonymous Floridian friend of Rubio’s as saying the gridlock in the Senate had worn out the freshman senator. "He hates it," the source said. "I don’t know that ‘hate’ is the right word," Rubio told the newspaper at the time. "I’m frustrated." Rubio described in the story the plodding pace of the Senate after he was elected in 2010. He said he was forced to "slow-dance and wait" for the Senate to gain a majority in 2012 and 2014 in order to accomplish anything. He said he was then told in 2015 that, "We gotta wait to elect the president" to get any bills passed. The story said that was when Rubio essentially gave up on being a senator. But was Rubio correct in tweeting months later that he had never said he hated the Senate? Obviously we can’t check what he may have said in private conversations, so we’ll have to take him at his word there. And we don’t know the name of the source quoted by the Post, so we can’t learn more about that context. But Rubio has made comments that showed he sometimes was less than thrilled about working on Capitol Hill. What Rubio did say Rubio’s disenchantment with the Senate looks to have started early — he told a newspaper he was stymied by his first year in office. Dec. 18, 2011, South Florida Sun Sentinel: "I can't think of a single real high point. By and large, this has been a highly dysfunctional Congress, particularly in the Senate. It seems like the entire year has just been one big staged event, trying to get political advantage in the next election. You look at the major issues facing this country, and few if any of them have been confronted." But it wasn’t until he announced in April 2015 he was running for president and faced criticism for missing a third of his votes that his feelings about the Senate became a subject of discussion. Billionaire Rubio donor Norman Braman, a South Florida auto dealer, told National Review in April 2015 that Rubio was "frustrated with the fact that the Senate doesn’t do anything." And Rubio said on several occasions that he sought the White House because the Senate was ineffectual. Sept. 16, 2015, GOP presidential debate in Simi Valley, Calif.: (Donald Trump said during the debate that Rubio had the "worst voting record there is today," a statement we rated Mostly True.) "I'm proud to serve in the United States Senate. … In my years in the Senate, I've figured out very quickly that the political establishment in Washington, D.C. in both political parties is completely out of touch with the lives of our people. … That's why I'm missing votes. Because I am leaving the Senate, I'm not running for re-election, and I'm running for president because I know this: unless we have the right president, we cannot make America fulfill its potential." Sept. 17, 2015, Fox & Friends: "I’ve never missed a vote where my vote would make a difference. ... So when there’s a vote that’s meaningful and serious, we are there doing our job." Sept. 30, 2015, Hannity: "Yes, I've worked in the Senate for four years, but I'm not of the Senate. I work in the Senate, I’m proud to represent Florida in the Senate. But let’s remember why I went there to begin with. I went to the U.S. Senate because I didn’t like the direction of this country, and I didn’t think either party was doing a good job in that regard. And that’s the same reason why I’m not running for re-election, and instead I’m running for president." Oct. 6, 2015, Today: "The majority of the job of being a senator is not walking on to the Senate floor and lifting your finger on a non-controversial issue and seeing which way you’re going to vote. The majority of the work of a senator is the constituent service to committee work, that continues forward unabated." Oct. 7, 2015, New Hampshire TV interview: "These votes that are happening in the Senate, we’re not going to be able to make a difference unless we have a new president, and a better president and that’s why I’m running for president." Post-Post story The same day the Post article was put online, Rubio addressed his voting record on CNN. He said that Senate votes were effectively pointless. Oct. 25, 2015, State of the Union with Jake Tapper: "I'm not missing votes because I'm on vacation. … I'm running for president so that the votes they take in the Senate are actually meaningful again. A lot of these votes won't mean anything. They're not going to pass, and even if they did, the President would veto it. " The Post story and Rubio’s comments led to an outcry in Florida media, with several outlets criticizing Rubio for not fulfilling his legislative duties. The Sun Sentinel wrote a scathing editorial calling for Rubio to resign, leading to the subject coming up in a debate. At the Oct. 28, 2015, GOP debate in Boulder, Colo., CNBC anchor Carl Quintanilla asked Rubio about the editorial and whether he hated his job. Rubio only called the editorial "evidence of the bias that exists in the American media today." He said prior presidential candidates Barack Obama, John Kerry and Bob Graham all had missed many Senate votes while campaigning for president, a claim we rated True. The issue dogged Rubio through the rest of the campaign. At a Jan. 5, 2016, town hall in Iowa, Rubio again said senators were basically powerless. "I have missed votes this year. You know why? Because while as a senator I can help shape the agenda. Only a president can set the agenda," he said. "We’re not going to fix America with senators and congressmen." He kept up his insistence that only a good executive can help in a Jan. 26 tweet of a campaign ad that said, "Washington is broken and both parties are to blame." Rubio dropped out of the race March 15 after coming in a distant second to Trump in Florida’s GOP primary. A month later, on April 14, Rubio excoriated the Senate in a floor speech for refusing to allow a vote on an amendment he introduced that would have curbed automatic welfare benefits for Cuban refugees. "They’re saying we can't do it, and no one will tell you why we can't do it except some procedural internal Senate thing," Rubio said. "This is ridiculous. This is why people are angry." More recently, after insisting for months Trump would not be the Republican nominee for president, he has pledged support to the real estate mogul. Meanwhile, GOP leaders have started asking him to seek re-election to the Senate in an already crowded Republican field. Our ruling Rubio said he never told anyone he hated the U.S. Senate. Private conversations notwithstanding, we couldn’t find any evidence that he ever used the word "hate" (or any version of it) while discussing the Senate in a public forum. But it’s pretty clear Rubio harbored some disdain for the tedium of the political process, calling the Senate dysfunctional and votes meaningless.

pomt-13264	Says over 90 percent of Travis County’s eligible residents have registered to vote.	true	/texas/statements/2016/oct/14/bruce-elfant/bruce-elfant-says-90-plus-percent-eligible-travis-/	Nearly every voting-eligible Travis County resident ended up registering to vote in advance of the November 2016 elections, a local official declared. Bruce Elfant, the county’s tax assessor-collector and voter registrar, told reporters: "Since the 2012 election, we’ve added over 80,000 registered voters, which helps us get over our 90 percent voter registration goal," set in January 2016. As of Oct. 10, 2016, Elfant specified, his office had counted 713,871 registered voters, which he described as about 89.9 percent of the county’s citizens eligible to vote. At that time, Elfant said, another 11,000 applications had yet to be processed while more applications would come in before the voter registration deadline of Oct. 11. Elfant says he started from federal research Wondering about Elfant’s 90-percent-plus figure, we asked him to share his math. By email, Elfant replied that he started from a U.S. Census Bureau estimate indicating that in 2015, the county was home to 778,077 citizens of voting age and then adjusted that figure to get to an updated estimate. To reach the new estimate, Elfant said, he assumed the number of voting-age citizens in the county increased the same amount from 2015 to 2016 that it did, according to the bureau, from 2014 to 2015--or 18,551. But, he said, he reduced the 18,551 figure to cover just the stretch of 2016 preceding the mid-October registration deadline--getting an estimated gain of 16,232 voting-age citizens. Elfant said he then added the partial-year estimate to the bureau’s 2015 estimate of 778,077 voting-age citizens, reaching his October 2016 estimate of 794,309 voting-age citizens. Finally, Elfant said, he divided the 713,871 people registered to vote in the county as of mid-October 2016 into his estimate of voting-age citizens, getting the 90 percent result. When we heard back from Elfant a couple days later, he said the county’s tally of registered residents had reached 717,694, or 90.4 percent of voting-eligible residents by his analysis. On Oct. 14, 2016, Elfant emailed: "With at least 17,000 voter registrations still unprocessed, it is likely that 91% or even 92% are actually registered to vote but we won’t have a final tally for another week." Census Bureau surveys We sought to check the census bureau figures, hearing back from a bureau spokeswoman, Jewel Jordan, who pointed us to a bureau web page containing Elfant’s cited estimates of voting-age citizens in the county in 2014 and 2015. Jordan said by email the bureau nationally estimates voting-age citizens through its American Community Survey, which in 2015 entailed interviews of residents of more than 2 million U.S. households. Each person’s survey included a request for each resident’s birth date and: "Is the person a citizen of the U.S.?" Outside experts say estimates at play To our inquiries, experts called Elfant’s methodology sound even though he depended on estimated counts of voting-age citizens. Brian W. Smith, a St. Edward’s University political scientist, and James Henson of the University of Texas each pointed out by email that the bureau figures employed by Elfant to reflect citizens eligible to vote are estimates, not to-the-person counts. Smith said that outside of the government’s decennial census, "population surveys are always estimates which include a margin of error. It is not a precise measure because the population is always changing because of deaths, migration, undercounts etc. For example, if Travis County grew at a much faster rate than the estimates, the results could be under 90%, but we cannot be certain," Smith said. That said, Smith wrote, it’s reasonable to speculate that 90 percent of eligible residents has registered because some 86 percent appear to have done so in 2014 and that was a "low salience mid-year election." Smith reached the 86 percent figure by comparing the county’s 655,056 registered voters as of Nov. 4, 2014 to the bureau’s 2014 estimate of 759,526 county residents eligible to vote. Smith elaborated: "The county had two years to increase the voter registered rate by 3.8% and a lot of events in their favor" such as competitive March 2016 party primaries including Texas Sen. Ted Cruz as a candidate; an antic general-election campaign period; and a surge in voters registering statewide. Days after Elfant spoke, Texas Secretary of State Carlos Cascos said a record 15 million-plus Texas citizens had registered to vote--or 78 percent of the state’s estimated voting age population of 19.3 million though that count included non-citizens. Peck Young, who oversees the Austin Community College Center for Public Policy & Political Studies, said: "It is clear that this year 90+" percent "of the Citizen Voting Age Population of Travis County has been registered." Texas state official We also asked Alicia Pierce of the secretary of state’s office to assess Elfant’s claim; she emailed us a spreadsheet tallying registered Texas voters by county and showing Travis County with 720,186 registered voters. That count breaks out to 90.7 percent of the county’s citizens eligible to vote as estimated by Elfant. By phone, Pierce advised that the state sticks to calculating registration rates using only voting-age population estimates--rather than working from estimates of citizens of voting age. In part, she said, the agency relies on the less precise metric to ease historical comparisons. The voting-age population estimates, Pierce said, come from the Texas Demographic Center located at the University of Texas at San Antonio. Our ruling Elfant said that over 90 percent of Travis County’s eligible residents registered to vote in advance of the November 2016 elections. Comparing the more than 713,871 voters registered at the time Elfant spoke to the county’s estimated 794,309 voting-age citizens--a figure rooted in 2015 household surveys--gets you to 90 percent. Folding in registrations tallied after Elfant spoke drives the result to a bit more than 90 percent. We rate this claim True. TRUE – The statement is accurate and there’s nothing significant missing.

pomt-01584	Obamacare "cuts seniors’ Medicare."	mostly false	/virginia/statements/2014/sep/08/ed-gillespie/gillespie-says-obamacare-cuts-seniors-medicare/	GOP Senate candidate Ed Gillespie says Obamacare won’t help you grow old. "It’s a law that cuts seniors’ Medicare," Gillespie said in a campaign email listing reasons why he opposes the health care law. This is a well-traveled claim that PolitiFact has met frequently over the years. Paul Logan, Gillespie’s campaign spokesman, backed up the statement, in part, with blurbs from fact checks written by our colleagues in two other PolitiFact bureaus. He pointed to a 2013 PolitiFact National article examining a claim by Scott Brown -- the Republican U.S. Senate nominee in New Hampshire -- that Obamacare "raises taxes and cuts Medicare." PolitiFact rated the two-pronged statement Mostly True, saying the law "definitely raises taxes," to help pay for its costs. But our colleagues also said the claim that Obamacare cuts Medicare is a complicated issue that undercut the accuracy of Brown’s full claim. PolitiFact has looked askance at bare statements that Obamacare cuts Medicare, rating them either Half True or Mostly False depending on how they are worded. Obamacare, to help cover its costs, also imposed a series of savings. Among them are measures that will reduce the increase in Medicare by $716 billion from 2013 to 2022, according to a Congressional Budget Office estimate. It’s important to note that Medicare spending will continue to rise, but at a slower pace than they it would have without the law. And the savings are focused on lowering payments to hospitals and insurance companies -- not beneficiaries. Gillespie’s says that Obamacare cuts "seniors’ Medicare." That suggests the law isn’t just reducing Medicare spending but is actually slicing Medicare benefits. To support that line of reasoning, Logan pointed to a couple of PolitiFact articles in which experts suggested that the reduced payments the law calls for could affect patients’ access to services. PolitiFact Wisconsin noted in October 2012 concerns that slowing growth in Medicare payments might discourage some health care providers from accepting Medicare patients. One area of concern is the Medicare Advantage program, which is run by private insurers and offers greater benefits than traditional Medicare for things such as dental care, free eye glasses and gym memberships. About 30 percent of the 54 million Medicare beneficiaries in the U.S. are enrolled in those plans, according to Kaiser Family Foundation estimates. Those privately run plans cost more per beneficiary than traditional Medicare, and Obamacare seeks to even out those costs. Some health care analysts have said the law’s Medicare Advantage cost savings might lead to its enrollees’ paying higher premiums or losing some of their extra benefits On the other hand, Gillespie does not mention that the health care law actually adds some new services: It gradually closes that gap in Medicare prescription drug coverage known as the "doughnut hole," funds illness prevention benefits and expands preventative care benefits. Logan also referred us to statements issued by for former U.S. Sen. Jim Webb, D-Va. In March 2010, Webb said said Obamacare would make "dramatic cuts in Medicare" and lamented the reductions in Medicare Advantage. Here’s a quick note on the timing of Gillespie’s email. Logan told us it was originally sent in January and was resent by the campaign on Aug. 25 after the Daily Press in Newport News -- which published a weekly PolitiFact Virginia digest --signed up recently to get automated email updates from the campaign. "Unless you want to single out that particular signup, it would be more accurate to refer to it as a January email rather than an Aug. 25 email," Logan said. Because the email is part of the campaign’s ongoing communications about Obamacare -- one that the Gillespie campaign feels free to resend -- we think it’s fair to judge it as a current line of attack from Gillespie’s campaign on the law. Our ruling Gillespie says Obamacare "cuts seniors’ Medicare," a statement that implies the law is reducing benefits across the board. There’s debate among analysts over how the law’s cost savings measures will impact some beneficiaries, particularly seniors enrolled in Medicare Advantage plans run by private insurers. Some of those seniors -- who comprise about 30 percent of Medicare recipients -- may lose some of the extra benefits they had before the law or could see higher premiums. Overall, the health care law slows Medicare’s growth, but spending will still rise significantly and some new services for seniors were added. So we rate Gillespie’s statement Mostly False.

pomt-07645	"2008: Unions Spent $400 Million to Elect Obama."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/mar/15/republican-national-committee-republican/rnc-said-unions-raised-400-million-obama-2008/	An ad from the Republican National Committee says that unions that supported President Barack Obama should stop fighting a budget deal in Wisconsin. "Obama and the union bosses are standing in the way of economic reform," the ad says, adding "Stop Obama and his union bosses today." Onscreen, the ad shows the words, "2008: Unions Spent $400 Million to Elect Obama." There’s no doubt that unions strongly supported Obama over Republican John McCain in the last election. But was it to the tune of $400 million? We decided to check it out. The ad cited Politico and the Wall Street Journal as its sources, so that’s where we went first. Both reported in March 2008 that liberal groups said they hoped to raise $400 million to spend in 2008. About $300 million would come from unions, and the rest from non-union advocacy groups, including MoveOn.org, ACORN and Emily’s List. So the part attributed to unions was $300 million, not $400 million. We also noticed that both the Wall Street Journal and Politico repeated the number in other news stories without attributing the information to a specific source. So we started looking around for evidence of whether the unions had succeeded at raising the hundreds of millions they said they would in March 2008. Keep in mind, the most detailed reports mentioned the number as a goal, not an amount that had already been raised. Our attempts at independent confirmation were difficult, because unions do not have to report all of their campaign spending to the Federal Election Commission, according to independent campaign finance experts. The unions do have to report direct contributions to candidates and parties and some of their independent expenditures. But they do not have to report internal communications to membership, and they don’t have to report get-out-the-vote efforts, even if the efforts are focused on heavily Democratic areas. We contacted the staff at the Center for Responsive Politics, a nonpartisan organization that tracks campaign spending. They told us that it would be impossible to account for all union spending during the 2008 cycle; the law doesn’t require that level of disclosure. But in the data required to be reported, the center found $75 million in direct contributions from unions and union members to candidates and parties, of which over $68 million went to Democrats. It also found $86 million in outside spending by labor in the 2008 cycle, which largely benefited Democrats. It also identified an additional $52.7 million in spending from labor groups in 527 organizations, tax exempt organizations that seek to influence elections. Add it up, and you get $206.7 million. The $400 million discussed in March might have been aspirational and not actually achieved, said Eric S. Heberlig, a political scientist who studies the labor movement at the University of North Carolina Charlotte. "The pressure to empty their coffers to help Obama out was less when they saw he was easily able to raise that amount of money elsewhere," he said. Indeed, Obama raised an unprecedented amount of cash on his own. Public disclosures showed he raised $745 million, compared with John McCain’s $368 million. The RNC said the unions "spent $400 million to elect Obama." We do want to acknowledge that independent publications have reported that number to be the case. But when we looked into the sources for that number, we found that it was the unions themselves discussing what they hoped to raise in the 2008 election. Furthermore, the reports said they wanted to raise $300 million, not $400 million, and it was a goal, not something they had yet achieved. When we looked at the public disclosures after the election, we found the unions reported $206.7 million in spending for all Democrats. It's clear that the unions raised additional money for get-out-the-vote activities, but we don't know how much more -- nor does the RNC. Finally, all that money went to support Obama and other Democrats, not just Obama alone. In short, we don't see the evidence to support that unions spent $400 million to elect Obama. So we rate the statement False.	None	Republican National Committee	None	None	None	2011-03-15T11:31:02	2011-02-24	['None']
pomt-12297	"When you throw 23 million people off of health insurance -- people with cancer, people with heart disease, people with diabetes -- thousands of people will die. … This is study after study making this point."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2017/jun/27/bernie-sanders/bernie-sanders-projection-thousands-added-deaths-g/	During an interview on NBC’s Meet the Press, Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., didn’t hold back in his criticism of Republican efforts to roll back the Affordable Care Act: He said such legislative efforts will literally be deadly. "What the Republican proposal (in the House) does is throw 23 million Americans off of health insurance," Sanders told host Chuck Todd. "What a part of Harvard University -- the scientists there -- determine is when you throw 23 million people off of health insurance, people with cancer, people with heart disease, people with diabetes, thousands of people will die." Sanders continued, "I wish I didn't have to say it. This is not me. This is study after study making this point. It is common sense." Even if it seems like common sense that insurance would save lives, would it be on the scale of "thousands," as Sanders said? And would legitimate studies show that? Studying the studies When we contacted Sanders’ office, spokesman Josh Miller-Lewis cited two sources. One is the "Harvard study" Sanders mentioned -- published on June 22, 2017, by the liberal Center for American Progress. It was co-authored by a Harvard professor of social epidemiology; two medical students who graduated from Harvard’s T.H. Chan School of Public Health, and two policy specialists at the Center for American Progress. To come up with their estimates, the authors of the Harvard-Center for American Progress report adapted the results of a peer-reviewed 2014 study of the Massachusetts state health care law -- a law that was a model for the Affordable Care Act. The 2014 study was lead-authored by Harvard professor Benjamin D. Sommers. The Harvard-Center for American Progress study projected that there would be one excess death for every 830 people who lose coverage as a result of the AHCA. Using Congressional Budget Office projections of the impact of the House version of the bill, the authors estimated an additional 217,000 deaths over the next decade, or 21,700 per year. The second piece of evidence Sanders’ office cited was an op-ed by yet more health policy specialists who are affiliated with Harvard -- David Himmelstein and Steffie Woolhandler, who are professors of public health at Hunter College-City University of New York as well as lecturers at Harvard Medical School. The op-ed -- published on Jan. 23, 2017, well before either chamber’s Republican health care bill was introduced -- used as its basis a different study lead-authored by Sommers. This 2012 study tracked what happened after states expanded Medicaid. Adapting the findings of the 2012 study to a scenario in which 20 million Americans lost coverage -- which turned out to be lower than what the CBO found for the House bill -- Himmelstein and Woolhandler estimated that there would be 43,956 deaths annually due to the GOP’s health policy changes. It’s worth noting, however, that both of these projections come from the ideological left. As we noted, the Center for American Progress is a liberal think tank. And Himmelstein and Woolhandler are founders of Physicians for a National Health Program, a group that advocates for single-payer national health insurance -- a proposal that is even further to the left than the Affordable Care Act. So can Sanders’ assertion be supported by the peer-reviewed literature alone? What prior studies say In our previous fact-checking of this issue, we found at least seven academic papers that detected a link between securing health insurance and a decline in mortality. Here’s a rundown. • In 2002, a panel of more than a dozen medical specialists convened by the federally chartered Institute of Medicine estimated that 18,000 Americans had died in 2000 because they were uninsured. In January 2008, Stan Dorn, a senior research associate at the Urban Institute, published a paper that sought to update the IOM study with newer data. Replicating the study’s methodology, Dorn concluded that the figure should be increased to 22,000. • A 2009 American Journal of Public Health study concluded that a lack of health insurance "is associated with as many as 44,789 deaths in the United States, more than those caused by kidney disease." • Three studies looked at state-level expansions of Medicaid and in each case found "significant" improvements in mortality after such expansions of coverage. These include a 2012 New England Journal of Medicine study of New York, Maine, and Arizona by Harvard researchers, and a 2014 study of Massachusetts by researchers from Harvard and the Urban Institute. (These were the two articles that formed the basis of the analyses cited by Sanders’ staff.) • A 2014 study published by the blog of the health policy publication Health Affairs looked at states that, at the time, had declined to expand Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act. It estimated that the 25 states studied would have collectively avoided between 7,000 and 17,000 deaths. • A 2014 study in the Journal of Clinical Oncology found improved survival rates for young adults with cancer after securing insurance under the Affordable Care Act. • A 2017 study in the journal Medical Care looked at a provision of the Affordable Care Act that allows young adults to be covered under a parent’s policy. The study found a decline in mortality among this population from diseases amenable to preventive treatment. (Mortality from trauma, such as car accidents, saw no decrease, as would be expected.) We found two papers with results that were more equivocal. • A paper published in April 2009 in HSR: Health Services Research. In it, Richard Kronick of the Department of Family and Preventive Medicine at the University of California (San Diego) School of Medicine, raised questions about the conclusions of the seminal Institute of Medicine study from 2002. Kronick’s study adjusted the data -- as the IOM had not -- for a number of demographic and health factors, including status as a smoker and body mass index, and found that doing so removed the excess number of deaths found in the original study. • A 2013 paper in the New England Journal of Medicine co-authored by Katherine Baicker of Harvard University compared about 6,000 patients in Oregon who got coverage through a 2008 Medicaid expansion and about 6,000 who didn’t. While the study found improvements in out-of-pocket medical spending and lower rates of depression among those who got coverage, key benchmarks for physical health -- including blood pressure, cholesterol, and blood sugar -- did not improve in such patients. But even the two lead authors of the more equivocal studies have told us that the scholarly record demonstrates that having health insurance saves lives, and that not having insurance can lead to additional deaths. We asked several of the authors of these papers whether they believe Sanders’ assertion of "thousands" of deaths is generally supported by the scholarly evidence. We heard back from three of them. " ‘Thousands’ is completely fair," Dorn said. Baicker agreed. "It is of course difficult to pin down an exact number of deaths that would be caused by a specific new policy," she said. "But a number like ‘thousands’ does not seem unreasonable, based on the available evidence." And Sommers -- whose work formed the indirect basis of the studies cited by Sanders -- concurred. "I agree that it’s challenging to pin down an exact number on this," Sommers said. But overall, the academic evidence "certainly gets you into the range of thousands of deaths per year." Our ruling Sanders said, "When you throw 23 million people off of health insurance -- people with cancer, people with heart disease, people with diabetes -- thousands of people will die. … This is study after study making this point." Sanders’ statement on Meet the Press was phrased generally enough to be defensible. We found ample evidence in the academic literature to suggest that legislation on the scale of the House bill would produce "thousands’ of additional deaths. That said, we can’t say with any specificity how many deaths will occur. It’s important to note that the studies provide estimates only, and each study found a slightly different result. On balance, we rate the statement Mostly True. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com	None	Bernie Sanders	None	None	None	2017-06-27T12:17:30	2017-06-25	['None']

Ted Cruz that Trump was in favor of the United States helping Libyans oust dictator Muammar Gaddafi. "He said I was in favor in Libya," Trump said, sounding perplexed. "I never discussed that subject. I was in favor of Libya? We would be so much better off if Gaddafi would be in charge right now." Oh, Trump discussed it. And thanks to BuzzFeed, we have the video. (All the hat tips to Andrew Kaczynski.) It comes from 2011, on Trump’s video blog. "I can’t believe what our country is doing," Trump said, according to a BuzzFeed transcript. "Gaddafi in Libya is killing thousands of people, nobody knows how bad it is, and we’re sitting around we have soldiers all have the Middle East, and we’re not bringing them in to stop this horrible carnage and that’s what it is: It’s a carnage." Trump continued. "You talk about things that have happened in history; this could be one of the worst," Trump said. "Now we should go in, we should stop this guy, which would be very easy and very quick. We could do it surgically, stop him from doing it, and save these lives. This is absolutely nuts. We don’t want to get involved and you’re gonna end up with something like you’ve never seen before." And then ... "But we have go in to save these lives; these people are being slaughtered like animals," Trump said. "It’s horrible what’s going on; it has to be stopped. We should do on a humanitarian basis, immediately go into Libya, knock this guy out very quickly, very surgically, very effectively, and save the lives." The U.S. military, working with NATO, spent about $2 billion and several months backing the Libyan uprising against Gaddafi, who had held power for decades. The uprising -- part of the Arab Spring -- toppled Gaddafi in August 2011, and rebel forces killed him the following October.

pomt-04806	"Days after the (Osama bin Laden) raid, Hollywood was invited into the White House so that they could receive a briefing" that revealed intelligence sources and methods.	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/aug/20/special-operations-opsec-education-fund/group-says-obama-revealed-secret-information-holl/	A new group of former special forces soldiers and CIA officers has produced a video that accuses Barack Obama of revealing sensitive intelligence information for cheap political gain. Calling itself Special Operations OPSEC (short for Operations Security), the group’s 20-minute video spends a great deal of time on the administration’s actions after the raid that killed Osama bin Laden. The group says it favors no candidate, but the frequent images of Obama (each time they say the word 'politician') leave no doubt that he is the target. At one point, a voice says, "The politicians turned that victory into an intelligence disaster." Among other failings, the video says the release of operational details of the raid would tip off the enemy and make future missions more risky. Fred Rustman, a retired CIA officer, voices particular disdain for the access granted to filmmakers who moved quickly to turn the raid into a movie. "Days after the raid, Hollywood was invited into the White House so that they could receive a briefing on exactly how the raid took place," Rustman says. "What kind of sources we had. What kind of methods we used. All for the purpose of making a Hollywood movie." As Rustman speaks, there’s a picture of a cheerful Obama standing at the front of the White House theater entertaining a group of smiling celebrities. For this fact-check, we'll explore whether it's true that the White House invited the filmmakers to a special briefing about the raid that revealed intelligence sources and methods. The movie in question is Zero Dark Thirty, which is scheduled for release in December and is billed as "The story you think you know … this is how it happened." The Hollywood connection The filmmakers, director Kathryn Bigelow and screenwriter Mark Boal, had been working on a bin Laden film before he was killed. Obama announced the death of bin Laden on May 1, 2011. Less than three weeks later, Boal met with two people at the CIA, the chief of staff and the director of public affairs. We know this, and many other details of Boal’s dealings with Washington insiders, thanks to a Freedom of Information Act request by Judicial Watch, a conservative organization that often sues to get access to government documents. Judicial Watch unearthed a trove of emails and other documents. They don’t necessarily prove the point made by the OPSEC group, but they show how a well-connected writer with battlefield experience was able to move with great speed and get at least some cooperation from the nation’s defense and national security agencies. And they reveal the thinking of the Pentagon, the CIA and the White House, as officials decided how they would deal with filmmakers working on a story the officials wanted to see told. Many people in those agencies already knew Boal -- or at least knew of him. He and Bigelow had won an Oscar for The Hurt Locker, the story of bomb disposal experts in Iraq. It was based on Boal’s time as a reporter for Playboy when he was embedded with U.S. forces in 2004. On May 1, Boal and Bigelow had begun shooting a movie about the 2001 battle at Tora Bora and the hunt for bin Laden. They pivoted quickly to make the movie about the final raid. By June 6, Boal had spent two hours at the CIA’s Counter Terrorism Center. A CIA public affairs officer encouraged others to cooperate, saying, "As he did with The Hurt Locker, he’s very concerned about operational security and will take any of our concerns into account." So from the start, that begins to contradict the group's claim that sensitive sources and methods were revealed. On June 9, a Pentagon staffer made exactly the same point in an email to the Under Secretary of Defense for Intelligence, Michael Vickers. A few days later, Vickers sent an email to the Pentagon’s head of public affairs to make sure everyone was on the same page. He notes, "At the direction of Director (Leon) Panetta, CIA is cooperating fully (not, obviously, giving away anything they shouldn't, but answering questions, such as 'How did you feel at that point'?)" That email reveals a Pentagon very intrigued with this project. Vickers wrote that he spoke to Adm. Eric Olson, a Navy SEAL who rose to become commander of the Special Operations Command, which oversees the SEALs and other special forces. "They are thinking it over," Vickers writes. "They would like to shape the story to prevent any gross inaccuracies, but do not want to make it look like the commanders think it's okay to talk to the media. They may want to offer up an (Team) 6 SEAL, who played a key planning role and knows the operators and story well." The potential offer to speak to a Navy SEAL planner is critical. It would represent extraordinary access for the filmmakers, but that access didn’t start with the White House. It started at the top of the military, and the Navy SEALs themselves. On June 15, two emails moved through the bureaucracy. One came from a key aide to Vickers who aimed to clamp down on leaks to the press about the bin Laden operation. All contacts had to be approved. "Even the simplest of comments, taken out of context or as an accumulation of information, can be extremely damaging to OPSEC," the aide wrote. (In this reference, "OPSEC" is referring to actual operations security, not the group running the video against Obama.) That same day, Douglas Wilson, the Pentagon’s head of public affairs moved to put Boal and Bigelow in a very different category from the others seeking access. He sent an email to the one of the White House deputy national security advisers and spoke highly of the filmmakers and the trust they enjoyed around the CIA and the Pentagon. He noted that Defense Secretary Robert Gates admired their work. He asked for guidance on what to do next and suggested a phone call that included the president’s head of counterterrorism. Boal had worked his way from the CIA, to the Pentagon and now got at least some cooperation with the White House. We checked the White House visitor log and found that Boal had meetings there on June 30 and July 2, 2011. A later memo quotes Boal saying he "spoke to the WH and had a good meeting with Brennan and McDonough." This likely refers to John O. Brennan, chief counterterrorism advisor and Denis McDonough, deputy national security advisor at the White House. The emails show the filmmakers spent time in "the vault," a room in the CIA building where some of the tactical planning for the raid took place. The emails also show the Pentagon’s head of public affairs trying to arrange to have a drink with the filmmakers at Ris, an upscale restaurant in Washington adjacent to the Ritz-Carlton hotel. The emails also have references to Boal’s dinners with CIA Director Panetta. Meeting with a SEAL? A telling meeting took place between the filmmakers and Vickers. In a transcript from July 15, Vickers offered the filmmakers a chance to talk to a Navy SEAL tactician. The dialogue is intriguing: Vickers: "Well the basic idea is they'll make a guy available who was involved from the beginning as a planner; a SEAL Team 6 Operator and Commander." Boal: "Are you talking about [name redacted]?" Vickers: "A guy named [redacted]. And so he basically can give you everything you would want or would get from Adm. Olson or Adm. McRaven." Boal: "That’s dynamite." Bigelow: "That’s incredible." Tom Fitton, head of Judicial Watch, called naming a Team 6 member "an egregious breach of public trust" and "a violation of any sensible effort to protect the names of those who participated in the raid." For Fitton, this leaves "no doubt it was a PR push and that involved access to the planner." But it is interesting that Boal already knew or at least thought he knew a SEAL Team 6 member. We should also note that while Vickers made the offer, the Pentagon later withdrew it, and according to the department’s assistant press secretary Carl Woog, the interview never took place. Woog emphasized that "the department has repeatedly stated, and the secretary has testified, that no classified information was presented to the producers." The National Security Council spokesman, Tommy Vietor, told us the individual was a planner, not an actual member of SEAL Team 6. As for the filmmakers’ access to high-level officials at the White House, Vietor said the nature of the raid made that necessary. "Very few people were part of that decision-making process," Vietor said. "So we tried to make some of those individuals available to journalists, authors and filmmakers to help them understand the process and the president’s thinking." The claim and the facts The OPSEC group's video paints a picture of an administration eager to claim glory and willing to reveal sensitive operational details to Hollywood producers. The image of Obama in the White House theater suggests the president himself regaled his visitors from Hollywood with the story of the raid. But we find the video is very misleading, suggesting Obama himself took part when there is no evidence of that. The photo comes from an event a year earlier when the president had a special screening of a television mini-series celebrating the American soldiers who fought in the Pacific theater during World War II. The OPSEC group claims that sources and methods were revealed, but we see no proof of that. The internal emails at the CIA and Defense department emphasized that officials would not share anything that might jeopardize future missions. They knew Boal and Bigelow and judged that they had proven they could be trusted. One email says Boal promised to provide officials with the screenplay for their vetting. Still, approval for the filmmakers’ interviews did come from the very top. The first to engage was Panetta, then-director of the CIA. The final approval came from the national security advisers in the White House. It is worth noting that the Pentagon has decades of experience of working with filmmakers. During the Iraq War, defense officials in the George W. Bush administration played a major role in making a movie about the mission to rescue Army soldier Jessica Lynch, who was captured by an Iraqi unit. In particular, the Pentagon has been generous in sharing many details about the methods of the Navy SEALs and their counter-terrorism methods. In an effort to boost recruitment, the Navy’s Special Warfare Command commissioned the feature film Act of Valor, which used actual SEALs as actors and was based on real-life missions. Our ruling The Web video by the group Special Operations OPSEC says "Days after the (Osama bin Laden) raid, Hollywood was invited into the White House so that they could receive a briefing" that revealed intelligence sources and methods. There is an element of truth to the claim because the producers did indeed visit the White House, met with national security officials and clearly got some cooperation from top brass at the Pentagon and CIA. However, we find no evidence for the main point of the claim, that the Obama administration engineered this and revealed intelligence sources and sensitive methods. We rate the claim Mostly False.

pomt-01500	Social Security and Medicare are "a Ponzi scheme."	false	/florida/statements/2014/sep/24/carlos-curbelo/nod-rick-perry-carlos-curbelo-calls-social-securit/	Congressional candidate Carlos Curbelo sided with Texas Gov. Rick Perry’s depiction of Social Security and Medicare as a "Ponzi scheme" in a talk with college Republicans. "I speak about both of these programs as one because they both suffer from the same long-term insolvency, meaning that they won't be around for us, meaning that we're paying into a system that, you know, is a Ponzi scheme," he told college students at George Washington University in Washington on Sept. 18 . "Rick Perry said that. That's one of the few things I think Rick Perry contributed when he ran for president last time -- and I worked for him, so I can say that." The Miami Herald’s Naked Politics blog wrote about Curbelo’s comments captured by a tracker when he was in Washington fundraising. (Many of the students who heard Curbelo speak are from Florida.) Curbelo faces U.S. Rep. Joe Garcia, D-Miami, in a district that includes many seniors from Miami to Key West so his comments drew a lot of attention. PolitiFact has rated several claims about whether Social Security is a Ponzi scheme including two we rated False by Perry leading up to the 2012 presidential election. We found some similar problems with Curbelo’s claim about Medicare. Social Security differs from Ponzi schemes We asked Curbelo’s campaign spokesman for evidence showing the programs are Ponzi schemes. Wadi Gaitan emailed us a statement that Curbelo was using "a figure of speech" and wants to preserve the programs for current and future generations. He provided no evidence that the programs are Ponzi schemes. Curbelo has made some broad suggestions for reform, including indexing benefits to life expectancy, (which already happens in part in Medicare) and changing how the cost of living adjustment is calculated. But first, what is a Ponzi scheme? The term originates with Charles Ponzi, a Boston swindler who conned investors out of millions in 1920 by promising returns of up to 100 percent in 90 days on investments in foreign postal coupons. After first-round investors harvested those profits, others flocked to Ponzi, unaware his "profits" consisted of money paid in by other investors. That strategy is unsustainable. In contrast, Social Security is more like a "pay-as-you-go" system transferring payroll tax payments by workers to retirees. A 2009 Social Security Administration online post stated: "The American Social Security system has been in continuous successful operation since 1935. Charles Ponzi's scheme lasted barely 200 days." Mitchell Zuckoff, a Boston University journalism professor who has written a book on Ponzi, noted three critical dissimilarities between Social Security and a Ponzi scheme. We will summarize Zuckoff’s comments from an earlier fact-check: • "First, in the case of Social Security, no one is being misled," Zuckoff wrote in a January 2009 article in Fortune. "Social Security is exactly what it claims to be: A mandatory transfer payment system under which current workers are taxed on their incomes to pay benefits, with no promises of huge returns." • Second, he wrote, "A Ponzi scheme is unsustainable because the number of potential investors is eventually exhausted." While Social Security faces a huge burden due to retiring Baby Boomers, it can be and has been tweaked, and "the government could change benefit formulas or take other steps, like increasing taxes, to keep the system from failing." • Third, Zuckoff wrote, "Social Security is morally the polar opposite of a Ponzi scheme. ... At the height of the Great Depression, our society (see 'Social') resolved to create a safety net (see 'Security') in the form of a social insurance policy that would pay modest benefits to retirees, the disabled and the survivors of deceased workers. By design, that means a certain amount of wealth transfer, with richer workers subsidizing poorer ones. That might rankle, but it's not fraud." Michael Tanner, an expert on Social Security at the libertarian Cato Institute says that Social Security and Ponzi schemes share some characteristics -- for example, in the early stages there is a huge windfall while those later on get smaller returns. However, Ponzi didn’t have the power of the federal government. "In the end the Ponzi scheme collapses and can’t make people continue to give him money, but Social Security can always force people to pay," Tanner said. "In theory Social Security can always go out and raise taxes to keep benefits flowing." Medicare Medicare, which pays for medical care for senior citizens, as well as for younger people with certain disabilities, covers 51 million people. (You can read more detail in a fact-check of U.S. Rep. Paul Ryan’s claim that Medicare is going broke which PolitiFact Wisconsin rated Mostly False.) Medicare has two main components and they are funded differently. The primary source of financing for Part A, Hospital Insurance, is the FICA payroll withholding. In other words, it’s pay-as-you-go: the contributions of current workers (and their employers) finance the care for current beneficiaries. Most of the costs for Part B, which helps pay for doctor, outpatient and other services, are covered by the government’s general fund and, to a lesser extent, premiums paid by beneficiaries. Part B also has a trust fund, but it’s different from Part A in that whenever expenditures exceed revenue, the difference is automatically covered by transfers from the general fund. There is also a Part C -- Medicare Advantage, which is a private-insurance alternative to Part A and has no trust fund. And there is Part D, a prescription drug benefit included in Part B. Both Social Security and Medicare face a huge burden in the future and are susceptible to problematic demographic trends as the number of workers supporting every retiree has declined dramatically over decades. However, budget experts say neither are Ponzi schemes. The programs face shortfalls in part because the number of new workers paying into the system grows more slowly than seniors receiving benefits. But both programs get funds from general revenues to bridge the gap, said Edward Lorenzen, senior advisor at the nonpartisan Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget. "While a Ponzi scheme is by its nature inherently unsustainable, the Medicare and Social Security programs can be made sustainable with changes in benefits and taxes," Lorenzen said. However, "the longer we wait to make those changes, the magnitude of the changes that will need to be made will be greater." Josh Gordon, policy director at the Concord Coalition, a group that advocates for balanced budgets, said. "The only difference with Medicare is that on its face it is even less ‘like’ a Ponzi scheme because for Medicare part B and D the system is designed to have general revenues (not dedicated taxes) pay for 75 percent of costs -- just like any other government program is paid for by the general revenue pool." Our ruling Curbelo said that Social Security and Medicare are "a Ponzi scheme." A Ponzi scheme is by definition an illegal crime and an unsustainable set-up that crashes very quickly. Social Security and Medicare, which have been around for decades, are not criminal schemes. Both programs face the massive challenge of fewer workers paying for the benefits of current retirees, and budget experts say Congress could make changes to make them more sustainable in the future -- though many politicians are reluctant to gamble with the support of current senior voters. Curbelo raises a legitimate point about the need for reform, but that’s entirely different than calling these programs "Ponzi schemes." We rate this claim False. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/d7b36257-5440-4096-9e67-6efaaec92f5b	None	Carlos Curbelo	None	None	None	2014-09-24T11:47:28	2014-09-18	['None']
pomt-14755	"Three or four countries" out of roughly 60 in the anti-ISIS coalition "are providing military force."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/dec/13/marco-rubio/marco-rubio-appears-right-only-3-or-4-countries-ar/	The United States has taken a leading role in the military fight against ISIS. But how much help is the U.S. getting from its allies? According to Republican presidential candidate Marco Rubio, not enough. "Listen, I mean, there's three or four countries that are providing military force. And the rest are signed on on paper but are not contributing significantly to the cause," Rubio said in a Dec. 12 interview for NBC’s Meet the Press. "The truth is the most important countries that need to be contributing, including men on the ground to fight, Egypt, Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Jordan, other Gulf kingdoms, are not." We decided to look at whether Rubio is correct that only "three or four countries" out of more than 60 in the anti-ISIS coalition "are providing military force." We previously fact-checked a statement by Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders that focused specifically on Saudi Arabia’s efforts in the fight against ISIS. He said, "Instead of fighting ISIS, (the Saudis) have focused more on a campaign to oust Iran-backed Houthi rebels in Yemen." We rated that True, noting that since September 2014, Saudi Arabia has deployed just four F-15 fighter jets and an unspecified number of Typhoon combat jets against ISIS. (Saudi state media trumpeted the participation, releasing photos of pilots who flew in the strikes and highlighting that the son of King Salman was among them.) Rubio’s statement is more broad. To get a sense of the bigger picture, we looked at data compiled by a group called Airwars.org, which tracks the international air war against ISIS using information released by the U.S. military and other sources, including coalition nations. Clearly, the United States has been doing the vast majority of operations against ISIS in Syria and the lion’s share in Iraq. In the most recent month, other allies have accounted for just 6 percent of the airstrikes in Syria and 30 percent in Iraq. Such data is consistent with Rubio’s statement, though determining the exact number of U.S. allies taking a significant role in "providing military force" is tricky due to a lack of transparency among some of the countries that belong to the coalition. The Pentagon only publicly breaks down the data into U.S. and non-U.S. strikes in Syria and Iraq — not further by individual nation. In Syria, the list of U.S. partners has included Australia, Bahrain, Canada, France, Jordan, Saudi Arabia, Turkey, the United Arab Emirates and the United Kingdom, while in Iraq the list has included Australia, Belgium, Canada, Denmark, France, Jordan, the Netherlands and the United Kingdom, said David Weinberg a senior fellow at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies. "However, some of those are only symbolic or largely out of date," Weinberg said. Weinberg pointed out a recent CNN report that quoted a U.S. military official as saying the Saudis and Emiratis are only launching about a strike a month, Bahrain hasn't dropped an airstrike since sometime in the autumn, and Jordan hasn't done so since August. Weinberg added that Canada "has been in the process of pulling out, Belgium suspended its strikes in July for some time, and Denmark suspended its involvement from September 2015 until sometime mid-next year." The non-U.S. countries with the best case for having taken a "serious" role in the air war, he said, include France, the United Kingdom, the Netherlands and Australia. Based on media reports and other evidence he’s pieced together, each has conducted more than 1,000 sorties against ISIS, or several hundred air strikes. Most of these have been in Iraq rather than Syria, he said. The only additional countries that might qualify for this most-active category are Canada and Turkey, but both of these countries come with asterisks. In Canada, the newly elected government of Prime Minister Justin Trudeau pledged during the campaign to terminate its involvement in anti-ISIS airstrikes, though it’s unclear whether that phase-down has been fully carried out. As for Turkey, it has been launching a large number of airstrikes in Syria since the summer, but many of those were against Kurdish rebels and not against the Islamic State, Weinberg said. Chris Woods, the director of Airwars.org, cautioned that some other members of the broader coalition, including some with only modest militaries, have been providing auxiliary assistance that may technically fall beyond Rubio’s definition but are nonetheless valuable to U.S. interests. "Italy provides vital in-air refueling for strike aircraft, for example, while Germany has just committed six Tornados for valuable aerial reconnaissance," Woods said. "At sea, the Belgians are helping protect the French carrier Charles de Gaulle. And on the ground, a significant number of nations, such as New Zealand and Portugal, are helping train Iraqi forces." To read more, see this summary from the Pentagon. Woods added that allied strikes have risen over time. Woods said there were more non-U.S. strikes in Syria between Nov. ,30 and Dec. 6 — 19 strikes — than in any week in the preceding year. By comparison, he said, there were 50 U.S.-only strikes in Syria that week. It’s also worth noting that Russia has been increasingly active in the air war, though it isn’t a member of the U.S.-led coalition. In addition, the extent to which it’s targeting ISIS rather than opponents of Syrian president Bashar al-Assad is unclear. Putting it all together, Weinberg said, "it's true that a only a handful of countries other than the United States are launching airstrikes in Syria and Iraq on any sort of significant scale, but it's extremely hard to confirm for certain whether it's precisely only three or four at the current moment." Bruce Riedel, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution and head of its Intelligence Project, agreed. Rubio’s statement, he said, "is correct if the question is who is putting boots on the ground or air power in Iraq and Syria against ISIS." Our ruling Rubio said that only "three or four countries" out of roughly 60 in the anti-ISIS coalition "are providing military force." The available government data and media reports suggest that Rubio is close to accurate. However, a lack of transparency in the operational data leaves a measure of doubt, and stating it the way he did glosses over the contributions from other nations that are taking important support roles even if they aren’t contributing much in the way of airstrikes. We rate his claim Mostly True.	None	Marco Rubio	None	None	None	2015-12-13T09:42:30	2015-12-13	['None']
pomt-09039	John McCain "began his career in Washington as a lobbyist when he was appointed in 1976 as the Navy's liaison to the United States Senate."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/jul/05/jd-hayworth/hayworth-claims-mccain-was-lobbyist-too-us-navy/	The primary isn't until Aug. 24, 2010, but the two Republicans facing off in this fall's U.S. Senate race -- John McCain, the incumbent, and J.D. Hayworth, the former House member who's challenging him -- are already engaged in bare-knuckled combat in their campaign ads. It all began in June, when McCain produced an ad that hits Hayworth for serving as a lobbyist. "J.D. Hayworth says he's an outsider, but after he was voted out of Congress he became a registered lobbyist," the narrator intones in the McCain ad. "Hayworth was paid thousands by a Florida corporation to lobby the very committee he used to serve on." When we analyzed the ad, we found disclosure forms filed with Congress that confirmed that Hayworth served as a lobbyist, so we ruled the statement True. In response, the Hayworth camp tried to label McCain as a onetime lobbyist, too -- a charge that McCain proceeded to attack in a second ad. In this item, we'll check the charge made by the Hayworth camp that was cited in McCain's second ad. McCain's second ad revolves around footage showing an unnamed Hayworth spokesman saying, "Sen. McCain started out as a lobbyist in Washington when in 1976 he was the liaison for the Navy to the United States Senate." We tracked down a similar quote from Hayworth spokesman Mark Sanders in a June 8, 2010, Associated Press report. Sanders told the AP that McCain "began his career in Washington as a lobbyist when he was appointed in 1976 as the Navy's liaison to the United States Senate. Talk about the pot calling the kettle black." So the question before us is whether someone holding the position of Navy liaison -- as McCain did for several years in the 1970s -- should be considered a lobbyist. There's evidence to back up both sides. In Hayworth's favor, Washington insiders do informally call the position a lobbyist for the Navy. The first mission listed on the home page of the Navy's Office of Legislative Affairs -- the office that includes the position McCain once held -- is to "plan, develop, and coordinate relationships between representatives of the (Department of the Navy) and Members of the United States Congress and their committee staffs, which are necessary in the transaction of official government business, except appropriations matters, affecting (the Department of the Navy)." That does sound a lot like the job description of a lobbyist employed by a private-sector company. A 2008 New York Times account of McCain's tenure in that position solidifies the notion that McCain did many of the same things that private-sector lobbyists do. "One of several military liaisons assigned to the Senate as advocates for their services and escorts for official travel, McCain quickly emerged as the senators' favorite," the Times' account said. "He had a thick head of hair as white as his dress uniform and he showed a natural politician's gift for winning over an audience. He excelled at leavening official business with a spirit of fun -- telling deadpan stories about his years 'in the cooler' (as a prisoner of war), playing marathon poker games on flights overseas or surprising senators at a refueling stop in Ireland with a side trip to Durty Nelly's, a 17th-century pub. He was the epitome of cool, one senator's son recalled, with a pack of Marlboros in one hand and Theodore White's memoir 'In Search of History' in the other. He relished the push-and-pull of legislative battles, eventually even plunging into defense budget fights with a personal agenda that was sometimes at odds with the Carter administration's Secretary of the Navy. He built personal friendships and professional collaborations across ideological divides, a hallmark of his later Senate career. And he applauded the Senate's leading hawks as they waged what they considered an epic struggle with the Carter administration over America's place in the post-Vietnam world." But McCain also has a point when he draws a distinction between what he did and what private-sector lobbyists do. For starters, there's a very specific legal definition of a lobbyist that is narrower than the more informal one sometimes applied to the Navy liaison. According to the most recent version of the Lobbying Disclosure Act, a lobbyist is "any individual (1) who is either employed or retained by a client for financial or other compensation (2) whose services include more than one lobbying contact; and (3) whose lobbying activities constitute 20 percent or more of his or her services’ time on behalf of that client during any three-month period." Typically, lobbyists fall into one of two categories. One is a free agent who represents one or more clients before the government, usually from a position within a law firm or a specialized lobbying firm. Usually these types of lobbyists are paid a monthly or yearly retainer, though sometimes they may represent a client on a volunteer basis. The other is an in-house employee at a corporation, labor union, trade association, university, membership group (like the AARP or the National Rifle Association) or other interest group. These lobbyists are typically full-time, salaried employees who lobby only for their employer. Neither describes the position McCain held. McCain was a federal employee, representing the Navy, and he was paid a federal-scale salary. The Lobbying Disclosure Act didn't exist in the 1970s, but the people occupying McCain's old job today are not required to register as lobbyists. We should also note that lobbying is not the only aspect of the liaison job. The home page of the Navy's Office of Legislative Affairs also lists non-lobbying responsibilities, including replying to requests for information by lawmakers and "supporting and hosting congressional visits and travel." Finally, we think it's reasonable to look at the implication of Hayworth's charge that McCain was a lobbyist. Even if McCain was in some informal sense a "lobbyist" for the Navy, the position he held diverges in significant ways from the popular perception of lobbyists. Unlike an experienced lobbyist in the private sector, McCain would not have been highly paid or had a substantial expense account. If anything, as a federal employees, particularly career military officials, operate under stricter restrictions on partisan activities than a typical private-sector lobbyist would. All told, the Hayworth camp isn't entirely wrong to describe John McCain in his old position as a lobbyist. In many ways, the advocacy duties he carried out in that position are quite similar to what private-sector lobbyists do. On the other hand, the impression created by labeling his old position as a lobbying job is misleading, since in-house federal lobbyists are neither lobbyists by official definition nor are they able to rely on the same tools as private-sector lobbyists can, especially deep pockets. So we rule the Hayworth camp's claim to be Half True.	None	J.D. Hayworth	None	None	None	2010-07-05T09:00:00	2010-06-14	['Washington,_D.C.', 'United_States_Senate', 'John_McCain']
pomt-06450	Slot machines in Miami-Dade and Broward counties have generated 20 percent of the promised $500 million per year for schools.	mostly true	/florida/statements/2011/oct/20/no-casinos/no-casinos-group-claims-slots-tax-revenues-are-pal/	Floridians have been duped by sky-high promises from the gambling industry in the past, says No Casinos. And that's why residents should be wary of any promises related to a new proposal for a massive casino in downtown Miami, suggests the group. Resort operator Genting has proposed a $3 billion project on the current site of the Miami Herald that would include an 800,000-square-foot casino in addition to more than 50 restaurants and bars, hotel rooms, shops and other features. An Oct. 11, 2011, press release from No Casinos picks apart a bill in the works by two South Florida legislators -- Sen. Ellyn Bogdanoff, R-Fort Lauderdale, and Rep. Erik Fresen, R-Miami. The press release states that it's a myth that "legalizing casino gambling will generate new tax revenue to meet important state needs…" "In fact, the last time voters trusted gambling interests, they were promised $500 million per year for schools from taxes on slot machines in Miami-Dade and Broward Counties. Promoters even signed a contract, saying that if the Legislature did not tax slot machines, they would cut a check directly to the school boards. So far, they have generated a paltry 20 percent of this figure – and recently they successfully lobbied the Legislature for a 30 percent reduction in their tax rate. Like the lottery, another promise broken." In this fact-check, we're not going to wade into whether casino gambling generates enough new tax revenue to meet the state's needs. Instead, we'll check what No Casinos calls a fact: that machine proponents promised "$500 million per year" for schools and only delivered about 20 percent of that. The root of the $500 million figure In November 2004, voters statewide voted to allow Miami-Dade and Broward counties to put questions on the ballot about adding slot machines at facilities. The tax revenue from the machines would then go to schools statewide. On March 8, 2005, Broward voters approved the measure. Miami-Dade voters rejected slot machines in 2005 but approved them in 2008. Then the Legislature, under the anti-gambling Gov. Jeb Bush, had to set the rules. The Legislature couldn't reach an agreement in the regular session and some GOP leaders, including Bush, talked about asking voters to repeal the amendment allowing slot machines. But in a special session in December 2005, the Legislature voted in favor of a bill that established the rules for slot machines. The source of the $500 million figure comes from 2004, when the state was moving toward putting the question on the ballot. The state's Office of Economic and Demographic Research prepared an analysis of the revenue that would be generated from slot machines. State officials gathered information about slot machines in other states in addition to information from proponents. EDR wrote in a financial impact statement in 2004 that: "If the Legislature also chooses to tax slot machine revenues, state tax revenues from Miami-Dade and Broward counties combined would range from $200 million to $500 million annually." A more detailed financial information statement from EDR stated that, "It is estimated that by the third year of activity, the range of tax revenues raised would be from $250 million to $600 million, assuming that both counties pass the referenda, and that the Legislature taxes the activity at a typical tax rate between 30 percent and 50 percent...Should only Miami-Dade County pass the referendum, the estimated increase would be between $70 million and $200 million. If only Broward County passes the referendum, the estimated increase would be between $100 million and $300 million." That paragraph alone provides several warning signs: For starters, it explains that the tax revenues would hit the range of $250 million to $600 million by the third year. It also notes that revenues will be on the lower end if it only passed in one county. But gambling proponents often just used the higher figures in describing the financial benefit. Jim Horne, a former state education commissioner who became a consultant for a pro- slot-machine group, stated that the revenues would be "roughly $500 million a year" in a September 2005 Florida Times-Union article or in the Sun-Sentinel in 2004 "$438 million after the first year alone." A series of ads by pro-slots group Floridians for a Level Playing Field urging voters to support Amendment 4 also used the $500 million figure: * This ad portrayed a woman as a school teacher saying "Florida schools could get an extra $500 million a year." * This ad stated that the amendment "could generate $500 million a year for all Florida schools" from seven facilities. * This ad stated that it was a fact that seven facilities "could provide $500 million a year to supplement not replace school funding statewide." Some articles raised skepticism about the $500 million a year claim. The Orlando Sentinel editorial board wrote Feb. 17, 2005 that although gambling interests said schools could reap up to $500 million, "until the Legislature acts, those claims are pure fabrications." A St. Petersburg Times editorial on Feb. 22, 2005, stated that slots supporters were "wildly" promising up to $500 million for education "In fact, nothing has been decided. If South Florida voters approve the referendum, the Legislature will determine how many slot machines are allowed, hours of operation, how much the gambling is taxed and how the revenue is distributed." The revenues that were actually generated The state's Department of Business and Professional Regulation tracks parimutuel revenues. The slot machine revenue is combined with net proceeds of the Florida Lottery and the Legislature annually appropriates the funds to education programs in school districts, state colleges and universities. Here is how much in net slot revenue (rounded) was actually transferred to the state Department of Education: 2006-07: $49.6 million (This wasn't a full year -- facilities opened part way through the year.) 2007-08: $120.6 million 2008-09: $103.8 million 2009-10: $138.1 million 2010-11: $125.1 million 2011-12 (July - Oct. 2): $31.5 million The tax rate started at 50 percent but the Legislature approved dropping the rate to 35 percent starting July 1, 2010. Looking at the first five years, the revenues add up to about $536.7 million -- or an average of $107.34 million per year. That's close to 20 percent of $500 million a year. If we discount that first year since the facilities were only operational part of the year and look at the next four years starting with 2007-08, it works out to about $122 million a year -- or about 24 percent of $500 million. So what happened? Dan Adkins, chairman of the Amendment 4 campaign Floridians for a Level Playing Field, and vice president of the parent company that owns Mardi Gras casino, told PolitiFact that the revenues were not as high as anticipated due to the tax rates, fees and restrictions set by the Legislature. "Gov. Bush looked me in the eye and said 'you may have won a campaign. I'm going to make sure you fail,'" Adkins said. "The Legislature and the governor wanted us to fail and they were almost successful. ... We were smacked with every possible restriction you can have." Revenues also were lower because only five facilities opened, not the seven that were planned. Adkins says slots proponents made a promise on a percentage -- that the parimutuels would provide 30 percent of their gross revenues to local schools -- but not on actual dollars. "How could you make a promise not knowing what the Legislature would do?" Adkins said. "That's why we entered an agreement based on the percentage." But what about the repeated claims that the machines could generate $500 million? "We said under a 30 percent tax plan this is what we could generate based on two counties passing referendums and seven facilities under operation." Our ruling No Casinos claimed that slot proponents promised the voters $500 million per year for schools and have generated a "paltry 20 percent of that figure." The ads that we saw stated that slot machines "could" generate $500 million a year. But at times Jim Horne, a key slots proponent, said it more strongly: "we're talking roughly $500 million a year for our schools" and "Amendment 4 will inject public education with $438 million after the first year alone. This funding will increase to $2.3 billion over the next five years." In reality, the amount of projected revenue at the time was more complicated and depended upon how many facilities added slots and whether it was in one or two counties and the rules set by the Legislature -- and proponents certainly didn't make those caveats clear in the ads we viewed although they did couch it with "could." The amount of revenue generated is about 20 percent a year of the $500 million. We rate this claim Mostly True.

pomt-06859	Says more than eight countries lead the United States in the percentage of college graduates.	mostly true	/new-jersey/statements/2011/aug/03/cory-booker/newark-mayor-cory-booker-claims-united-states-trai/	Newark Mayor Cory Booker said he was disgusted and angry. With federal officials mired in debate over raising the nation’s debt ceiling, Booker appeared on NBC’s Meet the Press on July 24 to discuss political gridlock in the nation’s capital. The generation of the Great Depression built the Hoover Dam and the Empire State Building at that time of crisis, but now "Rome, our capital, is fiddling with itself while the nation is burning," Booker said. Booker then pointed out how the United States has fallen behind other countries in the percentage of college graduates it produces. "We are a nation that, in that generation said, you know, ‘We're going to go to the moon. And we're going to do math and science and make sure that our kids are prepared to go there.’ But right now what's happening?’" Booker said. "Nations are passing us in droves. Over eight different countries now have a higher proportion of people graduating from college than we do." PolitiFact New Jersey discovered that Booker’s claim about the country’s college graduation rate was mostly right. In terms of young adults with the equivalent of an associate’s degree or higher, the United States is tied for ninth among the 36 countries analyzed by the Paris, France-based Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. First, let’s talk about how Booker received his numbers. The mayor’s spokeswoman referred us to an Oct. 19, 2010 speech by U.S. Secretary of Education Arne Duncan, in which he said: "Today, in eight other nations, including South Korea, young adults are more likely to have college degrees than in the U.S." U.S. Department of Education spokeswoman Jane Glickman provided statistics from "Education at a Glance 2010: OECD Indicators," which compares countries based on 2008 data. The OECD includes 34 member countries and works with other partner countries. According to that 2010 report, the United States ranked ninth in the percentage of people between ages 25 and 34 to achieve an associate’s degree or higher. At 42 percent, the United States was tied with Israel, Belgium and Australia, according to the report. The eight countries leading the United States in that age group were South Korea at 58 percent, followed by Canada, Russian Federation, Japan, New Zealand, Norway, Ireland and Denmark, according to the report. Older generations in the United States have fared better than in its OECD counterparts. The United States ranked higher in the percentage of adults between ages 35 and 64 who have college degrees, according to the report. "Not too long ago we ranked at or near the top in the world, and while our rate has grown very slowly, other countries have experienced rapid increases and overtaken us," Glickman wrote in an email, adding "we must sit up and take notice, especially since a degree is increasingly important for job opportunities in a changing economy." So Booker was right about young adults being more likely to have college degrees in eight other countries. But Andreas Schleicher, head of the OECD's Indicators and Analysis Division in the Directorate for Education, said in an email that one should not put too much emphasis on small differences between countries, because of the varied educational systems. Large proportions of young people in Germany and Austria enter apprenticeship arrangements, instead of higher education, Schleicher said. Russian Federation’s high graduation rate is related to short-term engineering studies that may not exist in other countries or only at the upper secondary level, which is comparable to high school in the United States, he said. "A range of factors may affect the figures including the organization of the education and training system and government policies regarding education," Schleicher said in the email. Alan Ruby, a senior fellow in the Graduate School of Education at the University of Pennsylvania, said four of those eight countries leading the United States don’t make for good comparisons because of their smaller sizes. But why does the United States rank below some of the other countries? Schleicher suggested the tuition fees in the United States -- the highest in the OECD -- affect participation rates. Ruby said some young people falsely believe there aren’t benefits to attending college. Let’s review: Booker said the United States trails "over eight different countries" in college graduates. The mayor shouldn’t have included the word "over" in his statement, but he’s on target when it comes to the younger generation of college graduates. But since each country may have different educational policies affecting the overall rankings, we rate the statement Mostly True. To comment on this ruling, go to NJ.com.

pomt-06276	Says "we’re losing one voter every 13 minutes."	mostly true	/oregon/statements/2011/nov/23/our-oregon/could-we-really-be-losing-one-voter-every-13-minut/	The next general election for president is almost a year away. But given that the Republican presidential hopefuls are already meeting for weekly debates, we probably shouldn’t be surprised that Our Oregon, a progressive political organization, is already laying the way for its get-out-the-vote effort. Our Oregon’s website makes a call to arms: "The need for voter registration is constant, especially in Oregon. With our vote-by-mail system, the people least likely to be registered to vote (young people, low-income people) are the ones most likely to get knocked off the rolls each year." Then they put that need in perspective. According to Our Oregon, overall voter registration is down by more than 119,000 voters from the peak in November 2008. "That’s like losing a voter every 13 minutes," the site concludes. That statistic caught our eye. Could Oregon, which traditionally has high voter participation, really be hemorrhaging one voter every 13 minutes? We gave Our Oregon a call and they told us they’d simply compared the number of voters registered in November 2008 to the most recent registration figures. These can all be found on the Oregon Secretary of State’s website. We followed suit. According to monthly statistics, there were 2,154,288 voters on our rolls back in November 2008. (It’s important to note here that this number represents active voters. If a ballot gets kicked back to the county with an incorrect address, the voter is deemed inactive. That doesn’t mean those voters aren’t registered, just that they need to update their info with the state before their next vote.) Anyhow, back to our analysis: The most recent voter statistics come from September, showing 2,034,589 registered voters. (Again, of the active variety.) Take the latter from the former, and about 119,000 voters have slipped off the registers. There were about 1,060 days separating Election Day 2008 and the end of September 2011. If you put that into the number of missing voters, you get about 113 fewer registered voters each day. Take the number of minutes in a day -- 1440 -- and divide it by 113 and you do, in fact, get 13 minutes. Now, the figures seem to hold up. But one of the things we love to do with PolitiFact is offer up some context. When we thought about the dip in the number of registered voters, it occurred to us that registration a year before a presidential election is probably always a little anemic. (Observant, right?) So we pulled the figures and compared November 2007 to November 2008. We found that registers grew by more than 210,000 over that year. Same for November 2003 and 2004. During that period, registration actually grew by more than 260,000. Just to make sure we got the whole picture, we also checked the percent of eligible voters who were actually registered. During the 2010 election, an estimated 72 percent of eligible voters were registered, according to our secretary of state. That was down 5 percent from the 2008 presidential election. But even that dip seems fairly standard. In November 2006, the registration was down to 73 percent. But in November 2004 it had been 82 percent. This is all to say that during presidential election years, registration surges. We’re not saying Our Oregon got its math wrong. We are saying that the current drop isn’t anything special. For the last word on all of this we talked to Barry Pack, Oregon’s deputy secretary of state. He said that the figures Our Oregon cited were all accurate, but that it’s important to remember that there are many reasons why the number of registered voters might decline. According to a state analysis comparing registration in November 2008 and 2010, about 70 percent of the 250,000-voter decline is attributable to voter inactivity for two federal elections. The other loss came from voter death, ineligibility, moving and other reasons. Many of the folks in that 30 percent, Pack said, "are not an indication of lack of civic engagement." We circled back with Our Oregon and talked with spokesman Scott Moore, who said he didn’t think our research negated the point that the organization was trying to make, which is that registration needs to get ramped up -- as always. That brings us to our ruling. Our Oregon said we’ve lost about 119,000 since November 2008 -- one every 13 minutes -- and official figures back them up. The thing is, without the context that this is a pretty cyclical happening, that statistic sounds pretty dire. We think it needs context, so under PolitiFact rules, we’ll give it a Mostly True.

pomt-05200	Virginia "is home to more veterans per capita than any state in America."	false	/virginia/statements/2012/jun/11/bob-mcdonnell/bob-mcdonnell-no-1-state-veterans-capita/	Gov. Bob McDonnell -- who spent 21 years in the U.S. Army and Reserves and is the son of career Army officer -- is proud to talk about the large military bases in Virginia and the current and past service of many who live here. On Memorial Day, he addressed 2,000 at the Virginia War Memorial in Richmond. His speech, on the cost of freedom, included the claim that Virginia "is home to more veterans per capita than any state in America." The governor has made that statement several times and we wondered if he were correct. So we checked the state veteran counts listed on website of the Department of Veterans Affairs, which are from 2010, and compared them to state population tallies in the 2010 Census. The VA calculated there were 22.7 million veterans in the U.S. They made up 7.3 percent of the nation’s 308.7 million people. Virginia had about 822,300 veterans in 2010 and a census of 8,001,024 people. Veterans made up 10.28 percent of Old Dominion’s population. But three states topped Virginia’s veteran population per capita: *Alaska had a 10.84 percent veteran population. It had an estimated 77,000 veterans and a population of 721,523. *Maine had a 10.43 percent veteran population. It had an estimated 138,600 veterans and a population of 1,333,074. *Montana had a 10.31 percent veteran population. It had an estimated 102,000 veterans and a population of 989,415. We asked McDonnell’s office for the governor’s numbers and got a tally that was similar to ours. It was based on a 2011 VA estimate of veterans and the Census’ 2011 population estimate. Under that data, Virginia ranked third, with 10.17 percent of the population formerly in military uniform. The leader was once again Alaska, with a 10.7 percent population of veterans, followed by Maine, at 10.27 percent. Montana slipped to No. 4, at 10.11 percent. Gubernatorial spokesman Jeff Caldwell said McDonnell meant to say Virginia is "one of" the states with the highest per capita veteran populations and made a mistake while speaking extemporaneously. The governor made the same mistake on May 29, the day after Memorial Day, during his monthly broadcast on WTOP radio in Washington. With little effort, we found two other occasions where he made the erroneous claim. In case you’re wondering, Virginia has the seventh largest veteran population in the nation, according to the VA. Here’s a list of the top seven and their estimated 2011 veteran populations: California, 1,918,073; Texas, 1,683,237; Florida, 1,617,248; Pennsylvania, 933,404; New York, 913,489; Ohio, 867,240; Virginia, 823,348. Our ruling McDonnell’s office acknowledges the governor erred on Memorial Day when he said Virginia has the most veterans per capita of any state. Virginia was No. 4 in 2010 and moved up to No. 3 in 2011. We rate the governor’s claim False.	None	Bob McDonnell	None	None	None	2012-06-11T13:35:46	2012-05-28	['United_States', 'Virginia']
pomt-08540	Jobs incentive program "created over 1,200 high-wage jobs since 2009."	false	/florida/statements/2010/oct/03/tammy-hall/lee-commissioner-tammy-hall-says-jobs-program-brou/	A campaign advertisement mailed in late September for Lee County Commission District 4 incumbent Tammy Hall touts efforts to "RECOVER JOBS," citing "FIRST INITIATIVE — Economic incentive program created over 1,200 high wage jobs since 2009." Hall, a Republican, is seeking re-election in the Nov. 2, 2010, general election and is challenged by Debbie Jackow, who is running with no party affiliation. Hall says she is pleased with local government efforts to boost Lee’s economy in southwest Florida, and her campaign piece spotlights that effort along with other claims. So what about job creation efforts? In September 2008, Lee commissioners -- including Hall -- approved a plan to set aside $25 million from county reserve funds for economic development efforts. That fund came to be known as the Financial Incentives for Recruiting Strategic Targets -- or FIRST -- Initiative by the county’s Economic Development Office. But, has that effort really created 1,200 high wage jobs in about two years as Hall’s campaign message, sent the week of Sept. 27, claims? Commissioners have voted to award money from the fund to four companies to expand operations here: • April 2009: Gartner Inc. -- a technology research and advisory company -- received $350,000 from FIRST fund and $1.5 million from other state and local incentive programs. Gartner plans to hire 200 people, starting in 2011 and continuing through 2015. The jobs are expected to have an average annual wage of $60,000. • June 2009: Paramount Transportation Logistics Services Inc. was given $300,000 from the FIRST fund and $300,000 from other local and state programs to create 100 jobs with an average wage of $48,500 by 2012. About 36 people had been hired by the end of June, the most recent data available. • July 2009: Source Interlink Cos. -- a magazine publisher and distributor -- receives $1 million from the FIRST fund as part of plan to add 350 jobs by 2011, but the hiring schedule has been revised. The company now expects to begin hiring this year, adding about 50 jobs. The added jobs will have an average annual wage of $65,000. • February 2010: Algenol Inc. was awarded $10 million in FIRST funds to build a biofuel research facility off Alico Road in south Lee County. Unlike the other incentive agreements, the deal with Algenol is not tied directly to job targets, but the company now employs 67 people. About 30 of those employees have transferred from Baltimore. The center expects to eventually employ more than 100, with an average annual wage of $85,000. Those numbers add up to about 750 jobs to be created through 2015, but just more than 100 people have been hired so far, according to the latest information from Lee’s Economic Development Office. So where did Hall get the 1,200 number? "If you look at the county’s information, those are the jobs being created," Hall said. But not just by the FIRST funds. Hall said she asked the Economic Development Office for information on the projects funded through FIRST. She said the numbers she got back apparently reflect all job incentive programs. "I guess they put everything together," Hall said. "It’s misspoken to say it is all from FIRST, but the numbers are correct." Lee County constructs incentive agreements using a variety of programs, including the Lee County Job Opportunity Program, which can pay up to $6,000 per full-time job and a similar Florida program, the Qualified Targeted Industry Refund Program, which pays tax refunds of up to $3,000 for each full-time job. If you include incentive agreements using those programs, the county has announced agreements that total 1,048 jobs through 2015. About 189 people have been hired so far. Is a job pledged the same as a job created? "We are creating those jobs under contract," Hall said. "We are very proud of the progress we have started to achieve. "I think the message is that we are out there, doing our part as government to allow those jobs to accumulate," she said. Does "FIRST INITIATIVE -- Economic incentive program created over 1,200 high wage jobs since 2009" accurately convey that message and the facts? The number of jobs created is overstated by about 38 percent and most remain unfilled now. Also, the FIRST INITIATIVE program isn’t the only source of incentive money being used. So we rate this claim False.	None	Tammy Hall	None	None	None	2010-10-03T05:57:54	2010-09-27	['None']
pomt-07131	"This is the slowest job recovery since Hoover."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/jun/16/mitt-romney/mitt-romney-says-were-slowest-job-recovery-hoover/	During a visit to the Buddy Brew Coffee shop in Tampa on June 16, 2011, presidential candidate Mitt Romney became the latest Republican to invoke the Great Depression while discussing today’s economy. Taking a shot at the economic record of President Barack Obama, Romney said, "It's been a failure in the last several years to get America back on track again. It's taken longer to get Americans back to work than it took during the Great Depression. This is the slowest job recovery since Hoover. It breaks my heart. I want to get us back to work." (By Hoover, Romney meant President Herbert Hoover, who held office from 1929 to early 1933 and presided over the early years of the Great Depression.) We thought we’d check Romney’s history. We turned to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the federal government’s official source for employment figures. We believe there are two ways to analyze his claim, either by judging the number of jobs created or by tracking how much the unemployment rate decreased. The former is a pretty straightforward number, while the latter is shaped in part by how many people are looking for a job rather than dropping out of the labor market. But while the two statistics aren’t exactly parallel, either one can serve as a reasonable measure of a job recovery. We also decided to compare recessions by looking at the first 23 months after a given recession officially ended (which is when the recovery officially begins). We chose that period because the last recession ended 23 months ago. Doing it this way provides an equal baseline for comparing all recessions. The question of when to start counting jobs in a recovery is a point of some debate among economists. The issue came up in an earlier PolitiFact item. However, we’re taking Romney at his literal word, and he said "the slowest job recovery," which is the period after the recession has ended and the recovery has begun. We used the quasi-official arbiter of recessions -- the National Bureau of Economic Research -- to determine the start and end dates for recessions. We weren’t able to go further back than World War II, since that’s how far back monthly BLS data goes. Viewers can see how our numbers stacked up for each recovery here. But here’s the gist: Job creation. We compared the number of employed Americans at the start of the recovery to the number employed at the end of the 23-month period. Then we calculated the percentage increase (or decrease) in employment over that time period. By this measure, there were two recoveries weaker than the one we’re currently experiencing -- the one from November 2001 to October 2003, under President George W. Bush, and the one from July 1980 to June 1982, under presidents Jimmy Carter and Ronald Reagan. The George W. Bush recovery is especially striking, since the economy actually lost more than 700,000 jobs during the first 23 months after the recession ended. So by this measure, Romney’s claim that "this is the slowest job recovery since Hoover" is incorrect. It’s the third slowest. Unemployment rate. We compared the unemployment rate at the end of the 23-month period to what it was at the beginning of the period. By this measure, too, the current recovery is not the weakest. Three recoveries actually saw an increase in the unemployment rate after 23 months (ones under George W. Bush, George H.W. Bush and Carter/Reagan), while another (under President Richard Nixon) produced a smaller decline in the unemployment rate than the current recovery has. (Because a budding recovery can entice discouraged workers back into the labor force, it’s not unusual for the unemployment rate to rise in a recovery.) So, depending on the measure you use, there are either two or four recoveries since Hoover that were weaker than the current one. None of this is to suggest that the current recovery is robust. It isn’t. Measured by jobs created, it has been exceeded on a percentage basis by 10 out of the 12 recessions we looked at. Part of this likely stems from the severity of the recession (which most experts agree is the worst since the Great Depression) and part stems from a long-term trend toward relatively jobless recoveries. The first seven recoveries on our list averaged a jobs bounceback of more than 8 percent; the final five averaged 2 percent. And the latter figure would have been even lower -- half a percent -- had it not been for the unusually strong recovery that started under Reagan in November 1982. We asked the Romney campaign for a comment, but they did not immediately respond. Where does this leave us? Romney has a point that the current recovery is relatively weak by historical standards. But it’s inaccurate to say that "it’s the slowest job recovery since Hoover." Depending on what yardstick you use, it’s either the third worst or the fifth worst recovery since World War II. That’s not a great accomplishment for the Obama Administration, but we’re checking Romney here, and he chose to make his point in a way that isn’t accurate. So we rate the claim False.

pomt-00122	On spending growth under Gov. Andrew Cuomo: "Despite the fact that you continue to suggest that you’ve been able to hold the two percent, you haven’t."	true	/new-york/statements/2018/oct/26/marcus-molinaro/molinaro-says-cuomos-spending-not-good-he-claims/	Gov. Andrew Cuomo and his Republican rival, Marc Molinaro, argued about the condition of New York state’s finances during their only one-on-one debate of the campaign. Molinaro pushed back against Cuomo’s claim that he has increased spending by only 2 percent per year, lower than it has been in modern political history. "Your budgets have increased spending at about an annual rate of 4 percent each year," Molinaro said. "So, despite the fact that you continue to suggest that you’ve been able to hold the two percent, you haven’t." Since taxes and spending are a hot topic for New Yorkers, we decided to check Molinaro’s claim. Cuomo has said that he would keep spending increases to 2 percent every year. This is a voluntary cap, and is not part of state law. In 2016, PolitiFact New York checked Cuomo’s claim that he had kept spending increases to 2 percent, and found his claim to be True. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com But in the last two years, the rate of state spending has changed, according to experts. The state Division of Budget and independent budget analysts have agreed that when evaluating Cuomo’s pledge to keep state spending growth at 2 percent, expenditures in the State Operating Funds should be considered. Those funds are for state operations, funded by state resources. They exclude federal funds, which the state does not control, and capital spending. Spending included in State Operating Funds go beyond the state’s General Fund, however, and also includes things such as state-funded special revenue funds and some debt service. The independent Citizens Budget Commission, a nonpartisan, nonprofit research organization, analyzes state budgets and found that the 2018-19 budget, which began April 1, calls for increased spending of 4.5 percent. The commission found that, despite state leaders’ proclamations that spending growth had stayed at 2 percent, "after adjusting for shifts of certain types of spending out of state operating funds or across fiscal years, the budget actually increases 4.5 percent from fiscal year 2018." A commission analysis of the 2017-18 budget found that spending would rise by 3.7 percent, despite the administration’s claim that it would rise by only 2 percent. The administration moved spending around to other funds or other years in order to maintain 2 percent growth, according to the commission. The author of both of those reports, David Friedfel, spoke about the governor’s record on spending increases during a post-debate podcast from the commission and Gotham Gazette. For the first six years of his administration, Cuomo is right to say that he kept spending growth at 2 percent, said Friedfel, director of state studies at the commission. But in the last year and in the current year, that’s not the case, he said. "The 2 percent certainly isn’t accurate, and to continue to push that is problematic, just from a transparency perspective," he said. State Comptroller Thomas DiNapoli had similar findings. DiNapoli, who is independently elected and whose staff analyzes every budget, reports that increases in spending in the 2018-19 budget is more than double Cuomo’s state spending cap. DiNapoli’s budget analysis, released in July, stated that though the Cuomo administration had claimed that it stuck to a spending increase of 2 percent, when budget management actions are accounted for, such as taking $1.4 billion in spending for the Metropolitan Transportation Authority off-budget, "the Office of the State Comptroller estimates State Operating Funds spending growth at more than 5 percent." For the 2017-18 budget, DiNapoli found that after adjusting for budget actions that allowed the administration to claim only a 2 percent increase, that spending was actually set to increase by "approximately 4 percent." Our ruling Molinaro said that state spending under Cuomo has increased beyond the 2 percent cap, despite Cuomo’s claims. Cuomo has been in office since 2011. In the first six years, as PolitiFact New York and others have pointed out, Cuomo kept the growth in state spending to 2 percent. But in the last two years, state spending has increased beyond 2 percent, though the Cuomo administration has shifted spending in the budget to make it appear as if the 2 percent cap has been honored, according to experts. We rate Molinaro’s claim True.	None	Marc Molinaro	None	None	None	2018-10-26T18:06:12	2018-10-23	['None']

This story was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The story, in circulation since 2015, said Jacksonville residents Tito and Amanda Watts were selling wooden slabs spray-painted with gold paint on the street for $99.99. "I don’t care what the police say," the story quoted Tito Watts as saying. "The tickets are solid gold… it ain’t cut up two by fours I spray painted gold." The story even quoted an unnamed Jacksonville Police Department spokesman. It said the police confiscated over $10,000 in cash, five crack pipes and a baby alligator. Just like tickets that reserve a spot in heaven, the story is a fabrication. The Jacksonville Sheriff’s office found no records of such a case. The story would have likely made headlines; but we found no coverage by local newspapers of the event, either.

pomt-04252	"Every American now is $51,000 in debt. That’s money I owe, that’s money my children owe before they even go to kindergarten, that’s their check to the federal government right now."	mostly true	/new-jersey/statements/2012/nov/15/caroline-casagrande/caroline-casagrande-says-every-american-owes-feder/	Pity the poor children of the United States – they, along with their parents, are already in hock to the federal government for thousands of dollars. Assemblywoman Caroline Casagrande (R-Monmouth) made that claim Oct. 26 during an interview with Michael Aron on NJTV’s "On The Record." "Every American now is $51,000 in debt," Casagrande told Aron. "That’s money I owe, that’s money my children owe before they even go to kindergarten, that’s their check to the federal government right now." Casagrande’s number is solid, but she doesn’t have to worry about whipping out her checkbook or debit card any time soon, some federal budget experts say. Let’s start by reviewing the two commonly cited forms of national debt -- debt held by the public and total debt. Debt held by the public is money borrowed from investors outside of the federal government. The total debt represents debt held by the public as well as money the federal government owes itself, including for programs such as Social Security and Medicare. Now let’s look at the numbers in Casagrande’s claim. The U.S. Government Debt website on Nov. 6 – the date we started looking into Casagrande’s clam -- listed the national debt at $16,295,297,196,000. If that’s divided by 314,719,484 -- the total U.S. population, according to the Census Bureau, each American owes the federal government $51,777.21. So, Casagrande’s number is accurate. But should Americans actually expect to pay that bill? Not necessarily. Gary Burtless, a senior fellow of economic studies at the Brookings Institution who has worked as a government economist and served on federal advisory panels under presidents of both parties, explained that what the nation owes each year on the national debt is annual interest and principal payments. "Do grandma and the grandkids have to pay off the national debt, as Assemblywoman Caroline Casagrande seems to suggest? No, they do not," Burtless wrote. "Our grandkids’ great grandparents did not pay off the federal debt; neither did their parents or grandparents. There is no rule that the national debt has to be paid off in one generation, three generations, or even ten generations. Taxpayers do not face the possibility that they will receive a $51,000 bill in the mail anytime soon." An invoice might not be in the mail but Casagrande’s statement is fair, according to spokespeople for the conservative Heritage Foundation and American Enterprise Institute. "We’re not even going to pay off the debt, we’re going to pay down the interest," said Matt Jensen, a research associate in Economic Policy Studies at the AEI. " Under no proposal that I’ve seen is someone paying down the debt in real dollars. What we’re really talking about is paying the interest on the debt, forever. You’ll pay the interest, your children will pay the interest." Our PolitiFact colleagues in Virginia and New Hampshire also looked into similar claims in their states and found that the amount of debt cited by their lawmakers was largely accurate. Virginia Rep. Randy Forbes in January said the national debt amounted to $48,700 for every American or $128,300 for every U.S. Household. Our colleagues rated the claim True. In August, PolitiFact New Hampshire rated Mostly True a claim by Rep. Frank Guinta that every child in the United States has a $50,000 share in the national debt. Guinta received a Mostly True because that would mean each of the nation’s nearly 74 million children would owe $216,102. Guinta’s figure was accurate, however, when the debt was spread across the entire population. Our ruling Casagrande said in a television interview, "Every American now is $51,000 in debt. That’s money I owe, that’s money my children owe before they even go to kindergarten, that’s their check to the federal government right now." A simple mathematical calculation confirms that every American technically owes the government $51,777.21 toward the national debt. But will youngsters have to suddenly start handing over their allowances to pay down the federal deficit? Not likely. We rate the statement Mostly True. To comment on this story, go to NJ.com.

pomt-08960	Maurice Ferre says Kendrick Meek "has voted 98.6 percent of the time with the Democrat party."	true	/florida/statements/2010/jul/21/maurice-ferre/ferre-meek-hews-democrat-votes/	In a meeting with the South Florida Sun Sentinel editorial board on July 1, 2010, U.S. Senate candidate Maurice Ferre blasted Democratic rival Kendrick Meek for, basically, having a consistent voting record. In the words of Ferre, a former Miami mayor, Meek has voted 98.6 percent of the time with his political party. Ferre's point is to distinguish himself from his Democratic rival, whom he accuses of leaning too far from the political center. "I think the Democrat party needs to be a centrist party," Ferre tells an off-camera audience from a wooden table. The interview was recorded and posted on YouTube in a 7:12-minute clip. "In the case of Kendrick Meek, Kendrick Meek, in the Washington Post's view of each of these candidates, has voted 98.6 percent of the times with the Democrat party," Ferre said. Seconds later, Ferre compares Meek's voting record to that of other Florida Democrats -- namely, Sens. Bill Nelson, Bob Graham and the late Lawton Chiles. "None of them has voted 98.6 percent of the time with the Democrat party," Ferre said. The percentage is so high and so specific, to the tenth of a decimal point, we decided to look into it. Ferre refers to a Washington Post online database that shows how members of the U.S. Congress have voted since 1991. It indeed reveals that in the current session of Congress, Meek has voted with a majority of his Democratic colleagues slightly below 98.6 percent of the time -- 98.4 percent, to be exact. That's based on 1,355 votes and does not include votes in which Meek did not vote. For comparison, 79 other House members, all Democrats, voted with their party at the same percentage or an even higher level in the current session. All Democrats combined voted with their party 92.3 percent of the time, and all Republicans voted with their party 88.4 percent of the time. As expected, a high level of party allegiance is common for most members. We next looked at OpenCongress.org, run by the Participatory Politics Foundation and the Sunlight Foundation, which also tracks votes by party. That site too put Meek at 98 percent for the current session. Meek's current figure largely mirrors his record in earlier sessions, according to the Washington Post database. In the 108th Congress (2003-2004), Meek voted 94.2 percent of the time with the Democratic party. In the 109th Congress (2005-2006) and 110th (2007-2008), he voted with a majority of his Democratic colleagues 98.4 percent of the time. But what about the other three Democrats Ferre mentions? Did they vote fewer times with their party? Nelson voted with a majority of his Democratic colleagues 92.7 percent of the time during the current Congress, according to the Washington Post database. Nelson was at 85.5 percent and 91.8 percent in two previous sessions. Similarly, Graham's percentages between 1991 and 2002 ranged from 81.8 percent to 92.9 percent. The Washington Post database keeps records back until 1991. Chiles left the U.S. Senate in 1989. The only issue with Ferre's claim is the minor difference between 98.6 and 98.4 percent. And so we rate his statement True.	None	Maurice Ferre	None	None	None	2010-07-21T11:56:27	2010-07-01	['Democratic_Party_(United_States)', 'Maurice_Ferré']
pomt-13834	African-Americans don't use drugs at a higher level than whites but "wind up going to prison six times more."	mostly true	/punditfact/statements/2016/jul/13/van-jones/van-jones-claim-drug-use-imprisonment-rates-blacks/	After two black men died at the hands of police, CNN commentator Van Jones tried to make a case for institutional racism in law enforcement with panelist Harry Houck, a former New York Police Department detective, during the July 7 edition of Erin Burnett Outfront. "The statistics don't lie about the excessive numbers of stops," said Jones, who is black. "Let's not talk about traffic stops. Let's take something tough like drugs. African-Americans don't use drugs (at a) higher level than whites. (It's) about the same percentage; about 12 percent. But we wind up getting arrested, not 50 percent more. We wind up going to prison six times more because there seems to be some institutional bias. Doesn't that bother you?" Houck's response: "That doesn't show any institutional bias." We were interested in Jones' statement that blacks don't use drugs at a higher level than whites, yet they the wind up going to prison six times more often. We fact-checked a similar statement in February 2016, when presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton declared that "African-Americans are more likely to be arrested by police and sentenced to longer prison terms for doing the same thing that whites do." We rated that statement True. But Jones' comment was less generic, dealing specifically with drugs. When we contacted him, he said he was going away for a while and couldn't remember the source off the top of his head. So we went looking for information. Jones may have been referring to data contained in the 2014 National Research Council report on "Growth of Incarceration in the United States: Exploring Causes and Consequences." Pages 60 and 61 focus on drug crimes. We'll talk about drug use first. The report says, "The prevalence of drug use is only slightly higher among blacks than whites for some illicit drugs and slightly lower for others; the difference is not substantial. There is also little evidence, when all drug types are considered, that blacks sell drugs more often than whites." We checked the overall data from the 2013 National Survey on Drug Use and Health. Here's the breakdown for all illicit drugs. There are racial differences in the types of drugs being abused, according to surveys by the federal Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration. Blacks, for example, are far less likely to have used marijuana, cocaine and hallucinogens in their lifetime than whites, but — at least in the case of marijuana — whites are more likely to give it up over time. With that backdrop, the National Research Council report says, "In recent years, drug-related arrest rates for blacks have been three to four times higher than those for whites. In the late 1980s, the rates were six times higher for blacks than for whites." Here's the drug arrest rate trend: But Jones was talking about the rates of imprisonment for drug crimes, not arrest rates. Those numbers turned out to be harder to find. We turned to Nazgol Ghandnoosh, a research analyst for The Sentencing Project, an advocacy group in Washington. She pointed us to data from the Bureau of Justice Statistics reporting on the number of people going to state prison for drug offenses and numbers from the United States Sentencing Commission on the racial makeup of drug offenders going to federal prison. Those numbers aren't perfect for our comparison. For example, the state prison data only lists inmates based on their most serious offense, so someone convicted of a drug crime may not be listed in that category if that person was given a longer sentence for assault. Adjusting for the number of blacks and whites (another approximation because many Americans are of mixed race), the black imprisonment rate for drug offenses is about 5.8 times higher than it is for whites. That's very close to what Jones said. It should be noted that these numbers vary from source to source. The NAACP's Criminal Justice Fact Sheet asserts that "five times as many whites are using drugs as African Americans, yet African Americans are sent to prison for drug offenses at 10 times the rate of whites." It doesn't list a source. Spokeswoman Raquel Coombs said the ratios may be out of date. We noted in the BJS data that the racial disparity has decreased significantly since 1991. That NAACP 10 percent imprisonment statistic appears to be based on 2003 data analyzed in 2009 by Human Rights Watch. (We also note that the drug-use statistic is easy to misread. Whites aren't five times more likely to use drugs. Five times more whites are using drugs because there are about 5.5 times more whites in the U.S. population than blacks.) We wondered why so many more blacks are going to prison for drug offenses. They're more likely to get caught selling drugs, as Michael Tonry, professor of law at the University of Minnesota, told us back in February. "Whites are more likely to sell to people they know, and they much more often sell behind closed doors. Blacks sell to people they don't know and in public, which makes them vastly easier to arrest." Blacks arrested for drugs are more likely to be sent to jail because they're more likely to have had a previous run-in with the law. Police tend to patrol high-crime areas more aggressively, which tend to be the poor areas, which have a higher proportion of minorities. Thus, they're more likely to be stopped for something and have a rap sheet once a drug charge comes along. As we found in our previous fact-check, their sentences also tend to be longer. Our ruling Jones said that African-Americans don't use drugs at a higher level than whites but wind up going to prison six times more. African-Americans use drugs at roughly the same levels as white Americans, although overall illicit drug use among blacks has been marginally higher than for whites, with some differences in the types of drugs used, according to a national surveys. Jones' bigger point was about the disparity in sentencing, and the rate of African-Americans' incarceration for drug offenses is very close to what Jones said. We rate his claim Mostly True.

pomt-13387	"The only years that anybody's ever seen" of Donald Trump’s tax returns "showed he didn't pay any federal income tax."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/sep/27/hillary-clinton/debate-hillary-clinton-tax-claim-ignores-years-whe/	Hillary Clinton is continuing to make an issue of the fact that Donald Trump has refused to release his tax returns, and at the first presidential debate, she suggested that one reason for his reluctance may be that Trump doesn't pay federal taxes. "Maybe he doesn't want the American people, all of you watching tonight, to know that he's paid nothing in federal taxes, because the only years that anybody's ever seen were a couple of years when he had to turn them over to state authorities when he was trying to get a casino license, and they showed he didn't pay any federal income tax," she said. Trump retorted that not paying taxes "makes me smart." In reality, neither Clinton nor Trump have their talking points correct. We looked at a nearly identical claim by Clinton previously and found it to be Mostly False. The truth is none of the tax returns she is talking about have ever been released, and she's ignoring other returns examined by New Jersey gambling regulators showing that Trump did pay taxes. The evidence is in a 1981 report that analyzed Trump's finances as part of his efforts to get a casino license for a proposed casino-hotel complex. The report, on Page 33, details Trump's income and federal tax payments for 1975 through 1979. The report states that Trump paid federal taxes for three of those five years to the tune of $71,932 on reported income of $219,334. (In current dollars, that would be a $296,121 paid in taxes on $910,319 in reported income.) In the final two years he did not pay federal income taxes because, according to tax rules, he lost money each year — more than $3.8 million then, or about $12.8 million today. New Jersey's Division of Gaming Enforcement verified his income, losses and deductions. The division said Trump's losses came from the operation of his various properties. But the report offers no specifics. We asked both the Clinton and Trump campaigns if they had any additional information since our original check. We didn't hear back. Our ruling Clinton said, "The only years that anybody's ever seen" of Trump’s tax returns "showed he didn't pay any federal income tax." Those records, covering five years of returns, report that in three of the five years Trump did pay federal income taxes. In two years he did not. The tax returns themselves remain secret. Clinton’s statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression. We rate it Mostly False. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/6adfa4d3-c309-41e1-940d-dd06448c5548	None	Hillary Clinton	None	None	None	2016-09-27T01:29:38	2016-09-26	['None']
pomt-04329	Says "Tammy Baldwin had the opportunity to vote to honor the victims of 9/11 and she voted against it."	mostly false	/wisconsin/statements/2012/oct/26/tommy-thompson/thompson-says-baldwin-voted-against-resolution-hon/	Republican U.S. Senate candidate Tommy Thompson uses military veterans, images of the fallen twin towers and pictures of 9/11 victims to criticize Democratic rival Tammy Baldwin in a new television ad. The ad opens with a female Air Force veteran stating: "Tammy Baldwin had the opportunity to vote to honor the victims of 9/11 and she voted against it." Images of the battered towers and victims memorial pass by. Two other veterans chime in with statements including: "It’s a slap in the face to every one of their families and anyone who has ever served in the United States military. Tammy Baldwin’s extreme far left approach leaves this country in jeopardy." And this: "It’s a very dangerous path Tammy’s leading us on." The ad concludes with a veteran stating: "What would you do if these were your children? How would you feel?" Let’s look at the core claim in this ad: That Baldwin, a U.S. House member from Madison, voted against a tribute to Sept. 11 victims. The claim stems from a Sept. 14, 2006, vote on a resolution commemorating the fifth anniversary of the Sept. 11 attacks. Baldwin was one of 22 House members -- 21 Democrats and one Republican -- to vote against the resolution. Thompson campaign spokeswoman Lisa Boothe said the matter was pretty cut and dried. "It is simple, she was one of 22 members that voted against it, an incredibly small margin. This was a near unanimous vote." So there is some truth in Thompson claim. But that’s far from the entire story. At the time, Baldwin delivered a speech on the House floor denouncing Republicans for adding language to the routine commemoration that she did not agree with. According to the Congressional Record, here’s what she said Sept. 13, 2006: "Mr. Speaker, on the fifth anniversary of the worst attack on American soil, my Republican colleagues have disgracefully politicized what should have been a solemn and sincere resolution. "This week we are mourning the tragic losses of innocent lives as well as commemorating the unsurpassed heroism that was on display that day. "We are expressing our gratitude to our nation’s law enforcement officers for their tireless dedication to make our country safer; and we are reaffirming our nation’s resolve to combat terrorism and secure our homeland. But rather than offering a bipartisan resolution that unites us on this solemn occasion, the Republican leadership converted the bill into an endorsement of the Patriot Act, punitive immigration bills, and other highly controversial measures, which many of my constituents oppose. "This bill was cynically transformed from a memorial resolution to an endorsement of President Bush’s failed policies. The Republicans show enormous disrespect to the 9/11 victims and families by playing election year politics with something as solemn as the fifth anniversary of 9/11; I will vote against the bill." The publication CQ Weekly, which covers Congress, described the resolution this way in a Sept. 18, 2006 piece: "But this year’s version was different. Taken up 54 days before one of the most pivotal elections in a decade, the measure afforded Republicans and Democrats a platform from which to argue about which party is more determined to prevail in the war on terror." The story added: "Republicans stuffed the bill with references to GOP-crafted measures that they say improve national security. Democrats, who voted for some of the bills listed in the resolution, wanted no references to new laws, and complained that framing the resolution that way made it too much of a political document." Thompson’s ad shows a portion of a Sept. 14, 2006, headline from Baldwin’s hometown Capital Times -- "Baldwin rejects 9-11 tribute" -- but not the entire headline, which read: "Baldwin rejects 9/11 tribute, saying it insults victims, families." The Baldwin campaign notes that she has voted in favor of a similar resolution honoring 9/11 victims nine times -- in 2001, ‘02, ‘04, ‘05, ‘07, ‘08, ‘09 ‘10 and ‘11. The campaign also points out that one day before the 2006 vote, Baldwin voted in favor of a resolution calling for "establishing a national memorial at the World Trade Center site to commemorate and mourn the events of February 26, 1993, and September 11, 2001." Our rating Thompson said his Democratic challenger voted against a resolution honoring 9/11 victims. Technically he’s correct. Baldwin voted against the measure in 2006 -- and criticized Republicans for adding in references to the Patriot Act, immigration bills, and other controversial matters. But Baldwin has voted nine times in favor of similar resolutions and the day before the vote in question supported creation of a memorial at the World Trade Center site. Thompson’s statement contains an element of truth, but leaves out critical information that would give a different impression. That’s our definition of Mostly False. (Editor's note: On Oct. 31, 2012, Milwaukee Journal Sentinel columnist Daniel Bice reported Baldwin had actually missed one of the nine votes her campaign cited -- a fact the campaign acknowledged, saying she was sick that day. )	None	Tommy Thompson	None	None	None	2012-10-26T08:50:00	2012-10-23	['Tammy_Baldwin']
pomt-11908	Says "80 percent of the tax breaks in" President Donald Trump’s tax-cut "proposal go to the top 1 percent, that is, people making more than $730,000 a year."	half-true	/texas/statements/2017/oct/20/lloyd-doggett/lloyd-doggett-says-80-percent-republican-sought-ta/	A Texas Democrat told congressional colleagues that President Donald Trump’s outlined plan to cut taxes would hugely--and mostly--benefit America’s wealthiest. U.S. Rep. Lloyd Doggett of Austin, whose district runs south into San Antonio, said in his Sept. 30, 2017, House floor remarks: "Eighty percent of the tax breaks in this proposal go to the top 1 percent--that is, people making more than $730,000 a year." Doggett made his claim three days after Republicans issued a framework outlining a proposed tax system with just three tax brackets, at tax rates of 12 percent, 25 percent and 35 percent, down from the current seven tax brackets. For personal income-tax filers, the framework calls for doubling the standard income-tax deduction while repealing most itemized deductions, including personal exemptions for dependents. The framework further says that the House Ways and Means Committee and Senate Finance Committee "will work on additional measures to meaningfully reduce the tax burden on the middle-class." Put another way, the legislation itself had yet to debut. The framework also lists big intended changes in business taxation including a reduction in the corporate tax rate to 20 percent. Doggett points to news story Doggett, asked the basis of his claim, pointed to an Associated Press news story citing a preliminary review of the framework that was issued Sept. 29, 2017, by the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center, a joint venture of the Urban Institute and the Brookings Institution. According to the AP report, the center found "that about 80 percent of the tax benefit would go to the top 1 percent — with income above $730,000 annually — by 2027." We confirmed that’s what the center’s analysis, "A Preliminary Analysis of the Unified Framework," concluded for the year 2027. However, the center pegs the top-1-percent income figure for 2027 at $912,100 in 2017 dollars; it separately lists $730,000 as what the top 1 percent would earn in 2018 when about half the benefits would flow to the top 1 percent, the analysis says. Generally, experts told us that no other reports on the plan’s effects on taxpayers came public before Doggett spoke. A few days later, though, the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy -- a research group that partners with Citizens for Tax Justice, which advocates for the tax interests of middle- and lower-class families -- predicted that in all but a few states, at least half the framework’s tax cuts would flow to the wealthiest 1 percent of residents. The nonpartisan Tax Foundation plans to issue a detailed impact analysis once the tax legislation firms up, an official there told us by phone. "As an organization, we decided that the unified framework was not yet detailed enough," Scott Greenberg said. He noted that among unsettled variables were the size of a revised standard deduction and an increased child tax credit. Center’s preliminary analysis Let’s get to details in the center’s analysis. For starters, the center’s estimates presume that the plan takes effect in 2018 and would decrease federal revenue by $2.4 trillion over 10 years. "In 2018," the analysis says, "all income groups would see their average taxes fall, but some taxpayers in each group would face increases. Those with the very highest incomes would receive the biggest tax cuts." According to the center’s estimates, the top 1 percent of Americans would get 53 percent of the plan’s benefits at the start--though reap 79.7 percent of the benefits in its 10th year, 2027. That is, in 2018, 53 cents of every dollar in tax savings would go to the nation’s wealthiest 1 percent of residents and in 2027, nearly 80 cents of every dollar in savings would accrue to the top 1 percent, the center estimates. A pause: Chris Edwards, a tax expert for the libertarian Cato Institute, cautions against solely considering the share of tax reductions potentially enjoyed by the super-wealthy. His nudge: Folks should be aware that the same Americans consistently account for a great deal of tax revenue. In 2014, according to IRS data posted by the Tax Foundation, the top 1 percent paid a greater share of individual income taxes, 39.5 percent, than the bottom 90 percent combined, 29.1 percent. The same year, per the government, the share of personal income earned by the top 1 percent of taxpayers rose to 20.6 percent. The center’s analysis of the Republican framework says: "Between 2018 and 2027, the average tax cut as a share of after-tax income would fall for all income groups other than the top 1 percent." In 2027, it says, the overall average tax cut would be smaller than in 2018, increasing after-tax incomes 1.7 percent. That year, the center says, about "80 percent of the total benefit would accrue to taxpayers in the top 1 percent, whose after-tax income would increase 8.7 percent," the analysis says. Under the plan, the center says, the number of taxpayers paying more in taxes would generally rise over time. "This is because the plan would replace personal exemptions, which are indexed for inflation, with additional credits for children and non-child dependents that are not indexed for inflation," its analysis says. "In addition, indexing tax brackets and other parameters to the slower-growing chained Consumer Price Index means that over time more income is subject to tax at higher rates," it says. A center researcher, Joe Rosenberg, advised by phone that the conclusion that the wealthiest Americans would reap more of the tax benefits in the tenth year traces to other Americans bearing more tax losses as a result of losing itemized deductions, especially deductions for paying state and local income taxes. Rosenberg also singled out the proposal to end the personal exemption, indexed for inflation, with a child tax credit not indexed for inflation. Rosenberg said the center did not analyze the "distributional" effects of the outlined plan for other years, meaning there are no projections of the degree of benefits absorbed by any subset of earners for years other than 2018 and 2027. After the center posted its analysis, a White House adviser, Kevin Hassett, chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers, questioned the validity of the projections given multiple assumptions made by the center. Rosenberg, asked about that critique, pointed out that the center’s analysis says up front that many aspects of the framework "were unspecified or left to be determined by the tax-writing committees in Congress." Doggett stands by statement We informed Doggett that he didn’t say in his claim that he was speaking solely about 2027 and he also gave the wrong figure for what the top 1 percent are projected to earn that year. Doggett replied by email: "In my remarks, I specifically noted that the tax breaks would go to those making ‘more than’ $730,000 a year. You correctly note that the number increases (more than), not decreases (less than) in future years, which further bolsters my point that the benefits go to the very wealthy few. Since if anything, I understated how inequitable this proposal is, I am pleased you are focusing on the inequity." Doggett also said that last he checked, the AP news story he shared with us (posted online by the Austin American-Statesman) hadn’t been updated to the 2027 dollar amount. Our ruling Doggett said "80 percent of the tax breaks in" President Trump’s frameworked tax-cut "proposal go to the top 1 percent, that is, people making more than $730,000 a year." The analysis Doggett referenced indeed indicates benefits will accrue to the very wealthy over time. Yet in the first year of changes, the top 1 percent are projected to draw a little over half the tax savings. The threshold of 80 percent going to the top 1 percent is projected for the tenth year. Also, Doggett’s stated figure for incomes is too low; it ties to the first year of implementation. We rate Doggett’s floor statement Half True.

pomt-08001	Says 15,000 IRS employees "have to be added to administer ‘ObamaCare’ and look at the tax implications."	mostly false	/wisconsin/statements/2011/jan/14/jeff-fitzgerald/wisconsin-assembly-speaker-jeff-fitzgerald-says-ir/	Days before becoming speaker of the Wisconsin Assembly, Jeff Fitzgerald was given a national platform to lay into the federal health care reform law that he and other critics call "ObamaCare." On the Dec. 27, 2010, edition of PBS Newshour, the Horicon Republican claimed that "from the IRS standpoint, 15,000 new employees have to be added just to, you know, administer ObamaCare and look at the tax implications." That’s a big, round number, so let’s check Fitzgerald’s math. Since President Barack Obama signed the reforms into law in March 2010, attacks by opponents have increased. In January 2011, Wisconsin moved to join 20 other states in a federal court lawsuit in Florida that seeks to overturn the law. To assess Fitzgerald’s claim, we asked his spokesman, former Milwaukee radio personality John Jagler, for the source of the 15,000 jobs figure. Jagler said it came from the Thomas More Law Center in Michigan. The public-interest law firm, which says it represents Christians and their religious beliefs, filed a suit in federal court in Michigan that is similar to the Florida case that Wisconsin wants to join. After a Michigan judge upheld the health care reforms law -- in a ruling the law center is appealing -- law center president Richard Thompson issued a statement. It said the health reforms will "add an estimated 16,000 to 20,000 additional IRS agents to monitor tax returns and records to determine compliance with the new regulations." So, Fitzgerald was slightly more conservative with his 15,000 claim. We checked with the IRS, which said it has not settled on a number or even done its own jobs estimate. So any number out there presented as fact is problematic. Back to the Thomas More Law Center number. Thompson arrived at his 16,000 to 20,000 estimate after reviewing articles by conservative think tanks and news outlets, according to law center spokeswoman Kate Lynch. Those articles cited a March 2010 Republican report from the House Ways and Means Committee, she said. That report didn’t use numbers as high as Thompson’s. It said the IRS "may need to hire as many as 16,500 additional auditors, agents and other employees to investigate and collect billions in new taxes from Americans" in connection with the health care reform law. The Republican report’s estimate was based in part on a November 2009 financial impact estimate by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office. The budget office projected that administering the law will cost the IRS between $5 billion and $10 billion over 10 years. The nine-page Republican report cited the 16,500 jobs figure five times. However, as our colleagues at PolitiFact National pointed out, the report also hedged its estimate, saying in a footnote that the number of additional IRS jobs likely will be between 11,800 and 16,500. Let’s circle back. Fitzgerald claimed that 15,000 IRS employees "have to be added" to manage the health care reform law, as if it’s a settled point. There’s little question more IRS workers will have to be added, but the agency has not set a number. And there is no evidence that 15,000 will be the final number, though it is within the range of one government estimate, albeit one done for House Republicans. We rate Fitzgerald’s statement Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.

pomt-12039	The mobilization of the military in response to the storms in Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands "is the largest ever mobilization of our military in a naval and marine operation" and an Air Force carrier there "was the first-ever as well."	mostly false	/florida/statements/2017/sep/14/tom-bossert/has-military-taken-unprecedented-action-response-h/	President Donald Trump’s homeland security adviser Tom Bossert said that the military has taken unprecedented steps in response to Hurricane Irma. By the time of this briefing Sept. 11, Hurricane Irma had weakened to a tropical storm as it made its way up the Florida peninsula. "The mobilization of our military in response to the storms in Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands is the largest ever mobilization of our military in a naval and marine operation, and we now have an Air Force carrier deployed in this effort; this was the first-ever as well," Bossert said. Was the military’s response to Irma the largest naval operation ever and the first time an aircraft carrier has been deployed after a natural disaster? For one, the Navy actually operates aircraft carriers, not the Air Force. More to the point, it is too soon to say that the U.S. response to Irma was the largest response to a hurricane, and it definitely was not the first time an aircraft carrier was deployed for that reason. Military response to Hurricane Irma is significant, but it’s too soon to say it’s the largest ever Hurricane Irma struck the U.S. Virgin Islands as a Category 5 storm and skirted along Puerto Rico’s coast with 185 mph winds. The storm continued on a track towards Florida, where it hit the Keys as a Category 4 hurricane in the Florida Keys and then again on Marco Island as a Category 3. The storm caused major, widespread damage from Miami to Naples to Tampa and Jacksonville. In response to Irma, the Defense Department said on Tuesday that it had dispatched 10,000 service members to the U.S. Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico, and 20,700 in the eastern United States. The National Guard reported Sept. 12 that it had deployed more than 15,500 guardsmen in response to Irma. In addition to service members, the Pentagon has deployed nine ships and the USS Abraham Lincoln, a nuclear-powered aircraft carrier controlled by the Navy. These numbers could change as the department assesses what is needed. Still, by numbers alone, the response to Irma at the time of this claim doesn’t quite stack up against the Pentagon’s response to Hurricane Katrina. By Sept. 7, 2005, nine days after Katrina made landfall, operations included 17,417 active-duty troops, 42,990 National Guardsmen, 20 U.S. ships, 360 helicopters and 93 military planes, according to a Congressional Research Service report. "Whether the Irma efforts become the largest deployment of U.S. military forces after a natural disaster remains to be seen, but it’s worth noting that more than 12,000 Department of Defense personnel assisted with Unified Assistance, and thousands were deployed after Hurricane Katrina," said Lance Janda, a military historian at Cameron University. More broadly, if you consider all naval and Marine operations (not just hurricane relief), then Bossert’s claim is even more inaccurate. "Clearly this was nowhere near the biggest naval/Marine operation ever—it was dwarfed by big wartime operations from World War II and the Korean war and even Operation Desert Storm," said Michael O’Hanlon, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution. Is this the first time the United States has deployed an aircraft carrier? The Navy Office of Information confirmed that this was not the first time an aircraft carrier has been deployed to help hurricane recovery efforts. After Hurricane Katrina, the USS Harry S. Truman deployed for rescue and recovery operations. In addition, the USS Saipan was deployed after Hurricane Hazel in 1954. And it’s not only hurricanes. In 1959, the USS Kearsarge deployed to Japan to help with relief efforts related to Typhoon Vera. The USS Abraham Lincoln was also sent to Sumatra to provide support for Indonesia after the 2004 tsunami. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com Our ruling Bossert said the Defense Department had put together "the largest-ever mobilization of our military in a naval and Marine operation." He also added that for the first time ever an "Air Force carrier" had been deployed in the effort. Bossert misspoke when he said "Air Force" carrier, but it’s still not the first time an aircraft carrier has been used after a natural disaster. Most importantly, it is too soon to say that the military response to Hurricane Irma was the largest ever. At this point, the response to Irma doesn’t quite stack up against the Pentagon’s response to Hurricane Katrina. We rate this claim Mostly False.

pomt-03744	"The vast majority of our public school students are receiving less state support than their private voucher peers."	half-true	/wisconsin/statements/2013/apr/10/sondy-pope/rep-sondy-pope-says-most-public-school-students-ge/	Even before Gov. Scott Walker unveiled his plan to expand school choice, a leading Democratic voice on education warned against spending more on "unproven and unaccountable" voucher schools. On a per-pupil basis, state backing for choice programs in Milwaukee and Racine already exceeds state funding for the average public school pupil, said state Rep. Sondy Pope (D-Cross Plains). "Last session Republicans chose to protect and expand private school vouchers and that came at the expense of public education," Pope said in a Jan. 30, 2013 news release noting the GOP-approved cuts to state school aid for public districts. Now, Pope said, "the vast majority of our public school students are receiving less state support than their private voucher peers." She offered statistical proof: "The average public student receives roughly $4,900 of state general aid while choice students are guaranteed $6,442 in state aid. Over 80% of school districts now receive less than the voucher guaranteed amount." Legislators are reviewing Walker’s 2013-’15 budget plan to increase funding to choice schools while capping overall public school revenue. As debate heated up on his plan, Walker contended that even after that increase, choice schools would be getting about half the funding per pupil that public schools get. We rated that Half True, noting problems with his math and methodology. Now let’s examine Pope’s claim that the vast majority of public school students are receiving "less state support than their private voucher peers." Pope's equation In evaluating Pope’s claim, one key phrase is "state support." Pope excludes non-state funding such as local property tax support and federal funding, which typically make up about half of public school district revenue. And she specifically defines "state support" as general aid distributed under the state’s equalization formula. We found numbers from credible sources that back up her specific claim, but also some problems inherent in the comparison. Based on figures reported by the nonpartisan Legislative Fiscal Bureau and the state Department of Public Instruction, just over 81 percent of Wisconsin’s public school districts received less in general state aid per-pupil than the $6,442 amount guaranteed to choice schools if they spend that much. The figures are for 2012-’13. Those districts encompass more than 75% of all public school students. Pope’s decision to zero in on state general aid fits with her talking points about restoring state general aid cut in the last budget session. And talking about general aid allows for a direct comparison with state aid to choice schools because in both cases the aid is unrestricted -- it can be spent on anything in the educational program. General aid is by far the largest source of state aid to schools. But her claim gave us a vague feeling of deja vu. Let’s go back to that Walker claim, that choice schools would get about half the funding that public schools get -- even after the increases in his budget in per-pupil aid to choice. Walker picked the largest possible revenue figure for public schools, one including federal funds, all state aid and local property taxes. Pope, by contrast, uses a much narrower -- if commonly used -- revenue figure for public schools. This explains why their conclusions are so starkly different. But some of the same cautions apply to both claims. Apples and oranges Researchers told us clean comparisons were difficult between the two types of schools. But they thought a better way was to compare public school revenue from state general aid and property taxes vs. the choice school guarantee of $6,442. The results of a comparison using that method would be dramatically different than Pope’s way. Statewide, public districts get an average of $9,884 from property taxes and general state aid. In fact, in the Walker item, we found that choice school revenue is about 25% lower than the public-school funding amount on average. (Important disclaimer: a complete comparison is currently impossible.) It’s important to note that Pope made clear she was concentrating on the state general aid payments that lawmakers cut, and was not discussing how schools compare when all funding sources are considered. However, there are more cautions and caveats even with that approach. On top of general aid, public schools also receive state funds for specific programs such as special education and class-size reduction. It’s known as "categorical aid." If you included that categorical funding, fewer public districts would fall below the $6,442 level. About 67 percent of public districts -- not the claimed more than 80 percent -- are below the choice aid level even with categorical aid included, based on calculations by the Wisconsin Taxpayers Alliance. The Milwaukee comparison Milwaukee Public Schools, we should note, is not one of the "vast majority" of districts where public students get less under Pope’s comparison -- or the broader view of including categorical aid. Students in Milwaukee Public School in 2011-’12 got $6,442 in general state aid -- the exact same amount of state-guaranteed aid paid out to voucher students there. Milwaukee is home to most of the nearly 25,000 voucher students in the state. Finally, there’s a nuance that affects the comparison Pope uses. Pope sets up a comparison of "state support" to choice and to public schools. But the choice funding of $6,442 per pupil really is a hybrid of state aid and local property taxes. It gets paid out 100 percent in state funds, and the state by law is on the hook for that amount (if schools spend to the maximum), so the $6,442 figure is often cited as "state support." But in reality, property taxes levied by Milwaukee Public Schools are estimated to support 34.7 percent of the $154.6 million Milwaukee choice program in 2012-’13. Racine property taxpayers also contribute a big chunk to that city’s choice program. Here’s how it works: The state offsets a big part of its costs by reducing general aid to Milwaukee and Racine, and in turns allows them to make up the difference by raising local property taxes. MPS officials say, given the size of the reduction, they are compelled to raise the tax to protect education. This property tax component is fiercely debated, because Milwaukee Public Schools levies for those funds but by law is not allowed to count those students for purposes of the state’s aid formula. The effect is a shift onto Milwaukee property taxpayers due to the lost state aid. The bottom line -- when you take the property taxes into account -- is the state’s estimated share of choice costs for 2012-’13 is $4,207 -- not the full $6,442, the Legislative Fiscal Bureau said in a March 6, 2013 letter to state Sen. Paul Farrow. If you use $4,207 as a comparison point, Pope’s result flips -- only 33 percent of public districts get less general aid than that. Our rating Pope said the "vast majority of our public school students are receiving less state support than their private voucher peers." As was the case in Walker’s diametrically opposed claim, Pope accurately cites funding figures to make a point. But the narrow way she sets up the comparison is both a virtue and a vice, creating a technically accurate statement that leaves too little room for important details necessary to explain such a complex comparison. We rate her claim Half True.	None	Sondy Pope	None	None	None	2013-04-10T09:00:00	2013-03-30	['None']
pomt-08614	"Under Tom Barrett’s leadership, violent crime in Milwaukee has decreased by over 20% -- to its lowest levels in more than 20 years."	pants on fire!	/wisconsin/statements/2010/sep/22/tom-barrett/tom-barrett-says-milwaukee-violent-crime-lowest-po/	Long before he entered the race for governor, Milwaukee Mayor Tom Barrett trumpeted the work of Police Chief Edward Flynn, who rode into town in January 2008 with the mayor’s strong backing. Indeed, every quarter seems to bring an announcement that the city’s violent crime rate -- a precise measure of certain crimes set by the FBI -- has fallen again. Barrett, a Democrat running against Republican Scott Walker, on his campaign website highlights those crime trends as good news of historic proportions. "Under Tom Barrett’s leadership, violent crime in Milwaukee has decreased by over 20% -- to its lowest levels in more than 20 years," the website reads. "He has worked with law enforcement, community groups and residents to develop proactive strategies, and empowered the city's police department with strong leadership and the tools it needs to get the job done." The claim of a big drop and a 20-year-low caught our attention, so we put it to the test. And it failed. When we asked the Barrett campaign to back up the claim, campaign spokesman Phil Walzak cited a Journal Sentinel story from Jan. 21, 2010, "Crime in Milwaukee continues to decline." The article compared 2009 figures to those from 2007. Of course, Barrett was elected mayor and took office in April 2004, so the clock on his leadership started ticking three years earlier. So, why start with 2007? In an e-mail, Walzak said the campaign started there "because those are the figures that most closely measure the work of Chief Flynn, whose appointment as MPD Chief Tom supported and who Tom has worked closely with to implement new crime-fighting tactics." The campaign goes even further back -- all the way to the tenure of Police Chief Robert Ziarnik -- for its claim that violent crime hasn’t been lower in more than 20 years. For its index of violent crime, the FBI looks at four specific types of crimes: Homicide, rape, robbery and aggravated assault. It is part of the Uniform Crime Reporting program, which includes a separate measure of nonviolent crimes. These are the statistics Flynn and Barrett cite each quarter when they tout the improvement in the city’s violent crime numbers. Walzak, though, says for the 20-year measure they are looking strictly at homicides. So, we’re already off on a bad track -- the campaign cherry-picked two years of data, not all the years of Barrett’s tenure. And it used homicides as a stand-in for all violent crime. To be sure, homicides attract the most attention. But Flynn and Barrett have regularly cited the broader number, with experts saying the murder rate alone can distort the picture. (Of the 6,446 violent crimes reported in 2009, 72 were homicides) Here’s what we found when we crunched the numbers: When you compare 2004, the year Barrett took office, with last year, reported violent crime incidents were 36 percent higher in 2009 than 2004. (Even if you make Barrett’s first full year in office, 2005, the baseline year, violent crime was still 5 percent higher last year.) If you look strictly at homicides, there was an 18 percent drop from 2004 to 2009. But the Barrett campaign talks about all violent crimes -- then it morphs the homicide number into the crime rate number and carries the comparison back decades. Homicides are at their lowest point in at least two decades. But the high-water mark in terms of all violent crime since 1990 actually came during Barrett’s tenure, in 2006. What’s going on here? When Barrett came into office on April 20, 2004, violent crime was at its lowest point during the past 20 years, thanks to a seven-year period when the numbers plummeted (see chart with this item). Barrett’s second full year, 2006, was marked by a surge to the highest point since 1990. Indeed, the city was among the national leaders in a spike in violent crimes. Since then, violent crime has fallen considerably, but reported incidents were still well above the 2004 level. National trends factor in. Crime experts have said the decline in violent crime that began in the 1990s was part of a long-term pattern. They cited falling crack cocaine use, a strong economy and other societal factors, with some citing tougher police strategies. Likewise, the subsequent jump was attributed to many factors. In 2007, Barrett himself cited a decline in federal funds for the community-oriented policing service program and the need for responsible gun legislation. Whatever the reasons behind the trends, the Barrett campaign is playing loose with its words and the numbers. The campaign defines its bragging about what has happened "under Tom Barrett’s leadership." But it cherry-picks the best two years to highlight, ignoring the full picture for his time in office. Then the campaign goes beyond Barrett’s time in office to say violent crime is at a 20-year low. This time it picks the pit out of the cherry, using the homicide rate as a stand-in for all violent crimes. In truth, the 20-year high point for violent crime was in 2006, two years into Barrett’s term. All that cherry-picking leaves voters with a false impression -- and leaves us with a sour taste. We rate the statement Pants on Fire. Note (Sept. 23, 2010): In response to this item, the Barrett campaign changed the statement in question to make it accurate.

pomt-13030	"Black Lives Matter, who are attacking law enforcement officers" -- Barack Obama "had them to the White House."	mostly false	/wisconsin/statements/2016/dec/02/sean-duffy/donald-trump-backer-sean-duffy-links-attacks-polic/	Nine days after the presidential election, a discussion about protests against Donald Trump led a Wisconsin congressman to lash out at Black Lives Matter and President Barack Obama. The attack was made on the Nov. 17, 2016 edition of "The O’Reilly Factor" talk show by Republican Sean Duffy, a Trump transition team member who has been mentioned as a potential challenger to Democratic U.S. Sen. Tammy Baldwin in 2018. Fox News Channel’s Eric Bolling, who was filling in for host Bill O’Reilly, asked whether Obama should take "a more forceful stand" on demonstrations over Trump’s victory that, in some cities, such as Portland, Ore., turned violent. Duffy responded by saying that Obama "might not be instigating these rallies, but he’s not shutting them down." Then he shifted to Black Lives Matter, which formed after a Florida jury in 2013 found George Zimmerman not guilty of murder in the shooting death of Trayvon Martin, an unarmed African-American teen. "And frankly, Eric, you know, Black Lives Matter, who are attacking law enforcement officers, he (Obama) had them to the White House. You have to recognize what President Obama is doing by not shutting down the violence that’s coming from the left-wing extremists in his party." So, Duffy is saying that Obama, in "not shutting down violence," invited members of Black Lives Matter to the White House even though members of the group "are attacking law enforcement officers." Attacking officers Duffy’s congressional office referred us to news reports on two incidents. August 2015: More than a year before Duffy made his statement, protesters in a Black Lives Matter march in Minnesota were captured on video yelling "pigs in a blanket, fry 'em like bacon." September 2016: A Dallas police officer filed a lawsuit against Black Lives Matter, Obama and others, alleging they "incite people to violence and cause violence" against law enforcement officers, including including five Dallas officers killed in an ambush two months earlier. Duffy spokesman Mark Bednar told us: "To incite violence, especially against a specific group of people -- in this case, law enforcement officials -- is a form of attack." There have been isolated incidents of physical attacks against officers at Black Lives Matter events. Here are three examples from July 2016: Chicago: A well-known activist was charged with striking a police commander and trying to disarm another during a Black Lives Matter protest of fatal shootings by police in Louisiana and Minnesota. St. Paul, Minn.: 21 officers were injured after protesters blocked I-94. A Black Lives Matter St. Paul leader said the protesters throwing things at police were not from his community. But Black Lives Matter Minneapolis posted on Facebook: "We shut down 94 for Philando," a reference to Philando Castile, who was shot dead days earlier by a suburban Minneapolis officer. Baton Rouge, La.: A police officer said he sustained injuries during a protest and in turn he filed a lawsuit against a prominent Black Lives Matter activist. He accused the activist of having "incited the violence," but did not allege that the activist was the one who attacked him. So, there have been isolated incidents of attacks on officers during Black Lives Matter events, but it’s not always clear who is responsible. Visit to the White House The second part of Duffy’s claim refers to a forum Obama held at the White House in July 2016 involving three dozen people. News reports said Obama met for more than four hours with the group, which included two Black Lives Matter leaders, other activists, Louisiana Gov. John Bel Edwards and other elected officials, law enforcement officials and community leaders. So, this wasn’t a personal audience with the president for leaders of Black Lives Matter -- it was a large gathering of people representing diverse interests. Moreover, Obama, while defending the Black Lives Matter movement, has condemned those who advocate violence. For example, while in Madrid in July 2016, he said: "Whenever those of us who are concerned about fairness in the criminal justice system attack police officers, you are doing a disservice to the cause." Our rating In saying Obama is "not shutting down violence," Duffy claimed: "Black Lives Matter, who are attacking law enforcement officers" -- Obama "had them to the White House." There have been isolated incidents of law enforcement officers being attacked during Black Lives Matter demonstrations, although it’s not always clear whether members of the movement are responsible. Two leaders of the movement were at a White House event with Obama, but so were some three dozen other people representing a wide variety of organizations. And Obama, while defending Black Lives Matter, has condemned attacks on police officers. For a statement that has an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression, our rating is Mostly False.

"USA: Mysterious Nazi submarine from WWII discovered in Great Lakes," said a May 22 headline on Cvikas. A similar story has appeared on various websites since 2016. Facebook flagged this story as part of its efforts to combat false news and misinformation on Facebook's News Feed. You can read more about our partnership with Facebook here. The story said that amateur scuba divers first spotted the boat in January and contacted authorities. Then, the story went, archaeologists associated with Niagara University and master divers from the U.S Coast Guard determined that they were dealing with a German submarine that sank during World War II and recovered it. But we found no legitimate news articles stating that such a sunken ship was recently discovered. The story included a photo of a rusted submarine. Snopes found in 2016 that the photo was an unrelated image of a rusting, decommissioned Russian submarine from the Cold War era. The story quoted Mark Carpenter, a supposed professor at the Niagara University. Thomas Burns, a spokesman for the university, said they do not have a professor by that name. The Coast Guard told PolitiFact that the story about a recent discovery of a Nazi submarine in the Great Lakes is false. However, something similar has happened in the past. "Years ago the Navy brought a WWII submarine onto the Great Lakes and at some point sank the submarine. So there is a WWII submarine sunken in the Great Lakes, but the Coast Guard didn’t work with Niagara University to recover a sunken WWII German submarine," the Coast Guard said in a statement. ABC 7 Eyewitness News in Chicago reported in 2013 about the history of a sunken German submarine in Lake Michigan. The German mine-laying sub U-C 97 was brought to the midwest on tour in the summer of 1919. "The U-Boat was on tour. It was kind of a post-war, 'we won' tour, and so people got to go on to it and see it, and then as a condition of the armistice, it had to be sunk," Pritzker Military Library CEO Ken Clarke told ABC news. In June of 1921, the sub was sunk by the military. But in this case, the story declaring that a mysterious Nazi submarine from WWII was discovered in Great Lakes is made up.

pomt-08968	Transporting drugs "is the price of admission" for people crossing the border illegally.	pants on fire!	/rhode-island/statements/2010/jul/20/john-loughlin/loughlin-says-carrying-drugs-price-people-have-pay/	John Loughlin, a Republican running for Congress in the 1st District, echoed a controversial claim about illegal immigration when he appeared July 9 on WHJJ's Helen Glover Show. Loughlin, fresh from a trip to Arizona, said that it's common for people crossing the border illegally to be carrying drugs for drug traffickers. "That's the price of admission," Loughlin said. "So if you want your family to go -- you, your wife, your kids, you know -- 'Here's a backpack full of drugs.' That's how you're going to get across the border." At another point in the conversation, he said, "And these are folks that come across the border and in many cases they're human traffickers. And in order to get passage across the border you gotta carry a knapsack full of 80 pounds of drugs. And if you get tired in the middle of the desert, they take the drugs off your back and leave you for dead. They found many of them just left for dead in the middle of the desert." Arizona Gov. Jan Brewer made a similar claim June 25, when she asserted that "The majority of people that are coming to Arizona and trespassing are now becoming drug mules." PolitiFact National examined Brewer's claim and, on June 30, judged it as False. PolitiFact concluded that while most experts agree that there is growing overlap between drug smuggling and human smuggling, the evidence shows that only a small percentage of those crossing the border illegally are carrying drugs. Even Brewer backed off her initial statement, issuing two clarifications. The second one said, in part: "The simple truth is that the majority of human smuggling in our state is under the direction of the drug cartels, which are by definition smuggling drugs." So, by her logic, if you're being helped by a drug smuggler, you're a drug smuggler, even if you're not carrying drugs. We alerted Loughlin's campaign to the previous PolitiFact story and asked for the source of the candidate's statements on the Glover show. Loughlin's campaign manager, Cara Cromwell, responded by noting that Loughlin never specifically said the majority of illegal immigrants were transporting drugs. But his words and the context of his comments clearly gave the impression that carrying drugs is now the price of admission for getting into the United States illegally. Cromwell also released a statement from the candidate saying that he got his information from law enforcement officials in Arizona, and she gave us a phone number for the Pinal County sheriff's office. "While the information is anecdotal, it is nevertheless a sad but true fact," Loughlin said in the statement. So we called, and then emailed, the Pinal County sheriff's office and asked how many people they had arrested for crossing the border since Jan. 1, and how many of those had been charged with drug offenses. Spokesman Tim Gaffney said that from Jan. 1 to May 18, their office turned over 100 people to the U.S. Border Patrol for being in the country illegally, of which 41 were charged with marijuana smuggling. So far so good. But it turns out that Pinal County is about 70 miles from the border, and those 100 people, said Gaffney, were picked up for a variety of reasons, not as they were crossing the border. "None of them are from that. They're all just from officer contacts, from citizens calling in the individuals," Gaffney said. "Almost all of them are traffic stops or citizens calling in regarding fights in progress or suspicious behavior where we get called to it." He referred us to the U.S. Border Patrol for broader numbers. We then called Steven Cribby, spokesman for U.S. Customs and Border Protection, who pulled statistics for the Tucson sector, which covers 262 miles of Arizona border, from the New Mexico state line to Yuma, Arizona. It's also the biggest and busiest sector. The 100 people (about 22 per month) picked up in Pinal County turns out to be a drop in the bucket. From Oct. 1, 2008 through Sept. 30, 2009, the border patrol apprehended 241,673 people (20,000 per month), Cribby said. How many of the 241,673 cases involved drugs? Cribby said the Border Patrol logged 1,602 apprehensions in "drug-related events" for that period. We did the math. That's less than 1 percent (0.66 percent) of all the apprehensions from that Border Patrol sector. But Cribby stressed that not everyone who is apprehended in a drug-related event is actually involved with drugs. "It just means they were apprehended in the same event," he said. So the actual percentage could be even lower. "For the most part, the people who are bringing drugs across, they're getting very heavily coached that as soon as you sense that the Border Patrol is coming to run away as quickly as possible" back to Mexico, said Tucson sector agent Colleen Agle. "And a lot of them try to come north with the intention of just hiding the load so that somebody who is already in the United States can come and pick that up. So they're trying to hide it and run back." So they're not even interested in staying in the United States. This seems to confirm what PolitiFact found in June when it received data from the Department of Homeland Security showing that, in March 2010, drug and drug-trafficking charges accounted for just over 5 percent of immigrations and customs prosecutions while simple immigration violations accounted for almost 89 percent. By saying that carrying drugs has become the price of admission for getting across the Arizona border illegally, Loughlin falsely created the impression that most immigrants sneaking across the border are being forced to pay this price.

pomt-13067	Financial conflict-of-interest "laws don't apply to the president, right? So, the president doesn't have to have a blind trust."	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/nov/16/rudy-giuliani/giuliani-president-trump-will-be-exempt-conflict-i/	How President-elect Donald Trump will handle his extensive businesses and financial holdings — and the potential conflict of interest that comes with them — when he gets into the Oval Office remains an open question. Trump has said his children will manage his business dealings. Many presidents in the past have put their assets in a blind trust, which is when an independent trustee manages another person’s assets without the person’s input. But Trump doesn’t actually have to do any of this because the financial conflict-of-interest laws don’t apply to him as president, said former New York City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, who is reportedly on the short list for a seat on Trump’s cabinet. "Well, first of all, you realize that those laws don't apply to the president, right?" Giuliani told CNN’s Jake Tapper Nov. 13. "So, the president doesn't have to have a blind trust. For some reason, when the law was written, the president was exempt." Giuliani has the law pretty much right. Trump, as president, has no legal obligation to detach himself from his businesses and financial interests. The law at issue is Title 18 Section 208 of the U.S. code. It says federal executive branch employees can’t participate in government matters in which they or their immediate family has a financial interest. Because of this law, some federal employees put their investments in a blind trust. This allows them to sidestep the regulation and participate in a matter that might otherwise pose a conflict of interest. But the president and the vice president, despite being executive branch employees, are exempt. According to the law’s definitions, Title 18 Section 208 does not apply to them, nor does it apply to members of Congress or federal judges. "It appears that presidents have mostly escaped the normal web of ethics and conflict-of-interest laws," said Scott Amey, general counsel at the Project on Government Oversight, a nonpartisan government accountability watchdog. Amey added that presidents are allowed to accept gifts in many cases, too. It’s been this way since at least 1974, when the Justice Department issued a letter saying Title 18 Section 208 did not apply to the president. Congress expressly codified the exemptions in 1989. In the 1974 letter, the Justice Department said the legislative history of this conflict-of-interest provision indicated that it was never intended to apply to the president. Additionally, the Justice Department said placing conflict-of-interest laws on the president could constrain him in a potentially unconstitutional manner, though it did not give specific examples. "As the head of the executive branch, the president may not be able to — and arguably under the Constitution it might not be possible to require the president to — recuse from government decisions," said Richard Briffault, a professor of legislation at Columbia Law School. While Title 18 Section 208 is the primary conflict-of-interest provision, there are other relevant rules, including a couple that don’t exempt the president. Trump and Vice President Mike Pence will have to disclose their finances, which is required of all high-level federal employees, Briffault said. But the disclosures are not as detailed as federal tax returns, which Trump has not released. Then there’s the Constitution’s Emoluments Clause, which bans U.S. government employees from accepting presents or compensation from foreign governments, noted Kathleen Clark, an expert on legal ethics and a law professor at Washington University in St. Louis. The Trump Organization has numerous foreign ties, including several overseas real estate deals with possible foreign government connections. In 2012, for example, Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan attended a ribbon cutting ceremony for Trump Towers Mall in Istanbul. "If any of Trump’s business arrangements involve the receipt of payments from foreign governments, I believe that he, or his entities from which he receives money, would have to forgo those payments, or he would have to detach from those entities," Clark said. But it's not fully clear that presidents are bound by the Emoluments Clause, and no court has weighed into answer this question. The way the clause is constructred — that it doesn't specify the president, unlike other provisions in the Constitution, for example — and the fact that President George Washington himself took gifts from the French government without asking Congress for permission, together make a good case that it doesn't apply to presidents, said Seth Barrett Tillman, a professor at Maynooth University in Ireland who has studied the clause. Our ruling Giuliani said financial conflict-of-interest "laws don't apply to the president, right? So, the president doesn't have to have a blind trust." The president is, in fact, exempt from the primary conflict-of-interest provision in the U.S. code. So presidents do not have any legal obligation to put their financial holdings in a blind trust or to detach themselves from their financial interests in any way. As president, Trump will have to comply with financial disclosure requirements, however, and it's possible he is constrained by a clause in the Constitution regarding income from foreign governments. We rate Giuliani’s claim True. Update Jan. 12, 2017: We have updated this story to add more information about the Emoluments Clause. Our rating remains unchanged.

pomt-06955	Says Planned Parenthood provides about 140 visits for prenatal care in each state.	false	/new-jersey/statements/2011/jul/18/michael-doherty/sen-michael-doherty-claims-planned-parenthood-only/	When Democrats and Republicans met on the floor of the New Jersey Senate on July 11 to discuss overriding vetoes handed down by Gov. Chris Christie, the debate ultimately turned to whether $7.5 million for family planning services should be reinstated -- some of which would go to Planned Parenthood centers. Democrats touted the importance of that funding for New Jersey families. Sen. Loretta Weinberg (D-Bergen) said of the clients served: "They are women who come for prenatal and postnatal health services so that they do have healthy families." But Republican Sen. Michael Doherty argued that the organization doesn’t provide much prenatal care. "There's a lot of talk about prenatal care and the fact is that Planned Parenthood just does not provide many prenatal visits. It's about 140 visits for each state in the entire country," said Doherty, who represents Warren County and parts of Hunterdon County. "So we’re talking (about) an organization we’re supposed to be sending people we care about to get top-notch care for prenatal visits and it turns out that they don’t really see a lot of patients." A resolution to override that veto failed in a 25-14 vote. PolitiFact New Jersey found that Doherty, a conservative, was right about prenatal care representing a small part of the services offered by Planned Parenthood, but he is wrong about there being about 140 visits in each state. Using the senator’s own reasoning, the number would actually be around 800 visits per state. First, let’s explain where Doherty received his information. Doherty referred us to a fact sheet prepared by the Planned Parenthood Federation of America, Inc., showing that 7,021 prenatal clients were served nationwide in 2009. Based on that figure, Doherty determined there were, on average, about 140 prenatal patients per state. Here’s the problem: the fact sheet said "clients," but Doherty referred to "visits" on the Senate floor. Clients refers to people. Visits refers to the numbers of times a client goes to Planned Parenthood. When we checked with Michele Jaker, executive director of Planned Parenthood Affiliates of New Jersey, she said Planned Parenthood centers provided a total of 40,489 prenatal visits across the country in 2009, which is the latest data available. Using the same formula that Doherty did, that number equates to about 809 visits per state. Jaker could not provide the number of visits in New Jersey, but said 581 prenatal clients were served in the Garden State in 2009. "His number right off the bat is wrong," said Jaker, referring to Doherty. Jaker added in an email that Doherty’s approach -- dividing the number of prenatal patients by 50 states -- was not an accurate assessment, because several states "only have one health center and don't have the facilities to provide prenatal care." Told about our findings, Doherty said: "I think you’re splitting hairs." But for his overall argument that Planned Parenthood sees few prenatal patients, Doherty is right. According to the same fact sheet, "other women’s health services," which includes prenatal care, only accounted for 10 percent of all services provided by Planned Parenthood nationwide in 2009. According to figures provided by Jaker, prenatal clients represented about 0.6 percent of the 91,617 patients served by New Jersey centers in 2009. Jaker said the number of prenatal clients served by Planned Parenthood is due to limited funding and the needs of the community. If a center cannot provide prenatal care to a woman, it will refer her to another resource in the community, she said. "If there are enough providers who do prenatal care for low income women, it may not be a service we need to provide," Jaker wrote in an email. "We could cover the needs of our patients through referrals." Pointing out how many pregnancies may go unnoticed, Dr. Donald Chervenak, president-elect of the New Jersey Obstetrical and Gynecological Society, noted how Planned Parenthood is helpful in providing pregnancy testing. Through earlier prenatal treatment, other medical problems can be addressed sooner, Chervenak said. Back to Doherty’s statement: The senator said Planned Parenthood doesn’t provide many prenatal visits, saying the figure was "about 140 visits for each state in the entire country." That figure is way off, because Doherty was using the number of clients. The actual number would be more like 800 visits per state. Figures provided by Planned Parenthood confirm that prenatal care represents a small part of the services offered, but since the senator’s figures were inaccurate to such a large degree, we rate the statement False.

pomt-00461	"Texas is one of the most gerrymandered states in the union."	mostly true	/texas/statements/2018/aug/16/beto-orourke/texas-one-nations-most-gerrymandered-states/	During a visit to HBO’s "Real Time with Bill Maher," Texas Democrat Beto O’Rourke brought up the issue of gerrymandering -- the drawing of district lines to benefit a particular party or group. "Texas is one of the most gerrymandered states in the union," O’Rourke said during the episode. (It’s at about 2:58 in this video.) Is that correct? We found that this is more of a fuzzy issue than a precise one, but the evidence suggests that it was not unreasonable for O’Rourke to make this declaration. "By most objective statistical or mathematical measures, Texas is one of the most gerrymandered states in the U.S.," said Daniel McGlone, a senior analyst with Azavea, a Philadelphia-based firm that has studied congressional district line-drawing. Michael Li, senior counsel with the Democracy Program at New York University Law School’s Brennan Center for Justice, agreed. "At the congressional level, it’s fair to say Texas is one of the most skewed" based on partisan bias, Li said. The hardest part of analyzing O’Rourke’s statement is sorting through countless measurements that can be used, experts said. "Does he mean gerrymandered by party? By race? Does he mean that the districts don't conform to traditional geographic criteria? You have to define what is meant by ‘gerrymandered’ before you can rank every state on a single scale," said Eric McGhee, a research fellow at the Public Policy Institute of California. (O’Rourke’s staff did not respond to an inquiry for this article.) Into the void have rushed "legal experts, mathematicians, data scientists and other experts suggesting various metrics or combinations of metrics to score and judge whether a district or plan is gerrymandered," McGlone said. A 2017 analysis by Azavea used a method called the "efficiency gap," a statistic developed by McGhee and Nicholas Stephanopoulos of the University of Chicago Law School in 2014. It measures how many votes a party "wastes" in a small number of districts. If the district lines had been drawn more efficiently -- essentially, more equitably -- these "wasted" votes could have been used to make other districts more competitive. Using this method, Azavea ranked Texas as the fifth-most gerrymandered state, behind North Carolina, Pennsylvania, Michigan, and New York. Another 2017 analysis, by the liberal Brennan Center, found that the three states with the strongest partisan bias in their district lines were Michigan, North Carolina, and Pennsylvania, followed by a second tier that included Florida, Ohio, Virginia -- and Texas, placing O’Rourke’s state in the top seven in this analysis. A third analysis, from December 2015, was undertaken by Christopher Ingraham, a data specialist previously with the Brookings Institution and the Pew Research Center and now with the Washington Post’s Wonkblog section. Ingraham’s calculation placed Texas seventh, behind California, Pennsylvania, Ohio, New York, North Carolina and Virginia. (All three of these studies looked at Pennsylvania's district lines before they were overturned and redrawn in 2018) Ranking Azavea Brennan Center Ingraham 1. North Carolina Michigan California 2. Pennsylvania North Carolina Pennsylvania 3. Michigan Pennsylvania Ohio 4. New York Florida * New York 5. Texas Ohio * North Carolina 6. 21-state tie Texas * Virginia 7. -- Virginia * Texas 8. -- Not specified Michigan 9. -- -- Florida 10. -- -- Indiana * Study did not distinguish ranking spots among these states So in these studies, Texas consistently places somewhere between the fifth and seventh most gerrymandered states. Each of these three analyses were derived from both geographical and political factors, taking into account both linear geometry and voting patterns. That makes these studies the most useful ones for analyzing O’Rourke’s comment, since he used the term "gerrymandering," placing the remark in a political context. A few other studies have taken a more limited look, focusing only on how complicated the district lines are, typically using the yardstick of "compactness." A perfect square or circle is compact; an octopus-shaped district is the opposite. A more complicated district border may be a sign that the line-drawers in the state legislature drew the map with partisan factors in mind. In compactness-only analysis, the congressional lines in Texas also rank as pretty non-compact, but not as high on the list of states as in the studies that take into account partisan voting history as well. One Azavea study used four different mathematical methods to calculate a district’s compactness. Texas ranked between 11th and 15th least compact in these four measurements. And Brian Kurilla, a North Carolina-based cognitive psychologist who writes the Geek Psychologist blog, found that Texas ranked 12th lowest in compactness. These studies are less helpful in analyzing O’Rourke’s remark, since there may -- or may not -- be a connection between byzantine district borders and partisan biases. "There are many reasons why a district might be non-compact, only one of which is partisan intent," said William T. Adler, a computational research specialist at the Princeton Gerrymandering Project. Others could be patterns of population settlement or natural geographical features, for instance. A third way to look at the question involves racial disparities enforced through congressional line-drawing. This is a harder-to-quantify factor, but Texas has been enmeshed in race-based redistricting lawsuits for years, suggesting that it would rank high if this metric were used instead. "Texas is a persistent offender" on race-based redistricting, said Sam Wang, a neuroscience professor who heads the Princeton Gerrymandering Project. "Texas' redistricting shenanigans are never-ending." Our ruling O’Rourke said, "Texas is one of the most gerrymandered states in the union." There are many ways to analyze this question, and depending on the method, the rankings vary a bit. But studies that look at the intersection of geographical compactness and partisan voting history consistently place Texas between fifth and seventh on the list of most gerrymandered states in the nation. Since O’Rourke called Texas "one of the most" gerrymandered states, such studies support his point. We rate his statement Mostly True.

pomt-12415	"You can see visits to Moscow made during the campaign by (Paul) Manafort and others."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2017/may/19/maxine-waters/rep-waters-exaggerates-trump-associate-moscow-trip/	The Justice Department’s appointment of a special counsel to probe Russia’s meddling in the 2016 election and any possible Russia-Trump campaign connection reaffirmed the belief of Rep. Maxine Waters, D-Calif., that impeachment is in the offing. Waters is confident that the special counsel and the congressional investigations will uncover proof of collusion. "I really do believe that much of what you saw coming out of Trump's mouth was a play from Putin's playbook," Waters said on MSNBC’s Morning Joe May 18. "I think you can see visits, you know, to Moscow made during the campaign by (Paul) Manafort and others." Waters went as far as to say that the "lock her up" chant aimed at Hillary Clinton was "developed strategically with people from the Kremlin, with Putin." While we have reported on the ties of Manafort -- Trump’s former campaign chairman -- to Russian interests, we wondered about Waters’ claim that he and others visited Moscow during the campaign. We found one clear example. There is no public record that Manafort went at all. Trump foreign policy adviser Carter Page did go to Moscow in July 2016. Former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn also went to Moscow, but at a time when he wasn't part of Trump's team. The Center for American Progress, a Democratic policy group, has a webpage it calls the Moscow Project where it compiles information on ties between the Trump campaign and Russia. The Democratic group lists no travel to Moscow by Manafort. Trump named Manafort to manage the Republican National Convention and by May 2016 elevated him to campaign chairman. Manafort stepped down in mid August. Manafort had dealings with Konstantin Kilimnik, a Ukrainian operative with reported ties to Russian intelligence. Kilimnik came to the United States twice during the campaign, but so far as we could tell, Manafort didn’t reciprocate with a trip of his own. The travels of Page provide the clearest support for Waters’ statement. Page founded an investment company with business in Russia. In March 2016, Trump mentioned Page as one of a group of advisers on foreign policy. In July, Page went to Moscow and spoke at a university graduation. After the election, he went to Moscow again. Page called the suggestion that he was a back channel between the campaign and the Russians a "witch hunt." The only other publicly known trip to Russia’s capital by a Trump insider was Flynn’s visit in December 2015 to celebrate the 10th anniversary of RT (Russia Today), a government media operation. Flynn reportedly was paid for giving a speech at the event. According to one account, Flynn went to Trump Tower at some point in the fall of 2015 to advise Trump on the Islamic State and Iran. In February 2016, he was reported to be someone Trump turned to on foreign policy. Flynn said he was advising multiple candidates at the time. It took until June before Flynn was openly praising Trump over Clinton. We reached out to Waters’office and did not hear back. Our ruling Waters said that Manafort and others with ties to the Trump campaign went to Moscow during the 2016 presidential campaign. From what’s on the public record, Manafort didn’t go at all, and Page went once. Flynn went after Trump announced, but before there is any report of a strong and exclusive tie to the candidate. The various investigations underway might resolve whether there was collusion, but the travel itineraries of Trump’s associates don’t appear to be fertile ground at this point. Waters made it sound like this was a regular occurrence. We rate this claim Mostly False. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com	None	Maxine Waters	None	None	None	2017-05-19T12:58:03	2017-05-18	['None']
pomt-05159	"In 2011, NJ economy ranked 47th--at the bottom with Alabama, Mississippi & Wyoming. Under Christie, NJ is falling behind."	mostly true	/new-jersey/statements/2012/jun/19/lou-greenwald/chris-christie-targeted-democrats-over-new-jersey-/	Gov. Chris Christie has been touting New Jersey’s economic success in appearances across the country, but back at home, Democrats recently jumped on a statistic to prove the Republican governor wrong. Between tweets, news releases and a YouTube video, Democrats have countered Christie’s "Jersey Comeback" theme with the claim that, under his watch, the Garden State ranked 47th in the nation for economic performance in 2011. "In 2011, NJ economy ranked 47th--at the bottom with Alabama, Mississippi & Wyoming. Under Christie, NJ is falling behind," Assembly Majority Leader Lou Greenwald (D-Camden) wrote June 6 in one of a few related tweets. On June 11, the New Jersey Democratic State Committee released a YouTube video that includes that statistic as a way of showing similarities between Christie and Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney. For this fact-check, PolitiFact New Jersey is examining two issues -- whether that 47th ranking is correct and how much Christie can be held responsible for it. Here’s what we found: the statistic is on target, but blaming Christie ignores other factors behind the lackluster economic activity. Tom Hester Jr., a spokesman for the Assembly Democrats, argued that the "burden of proof here is on Governor Christie" for touting and taking credit for the "Jersey Comeback." "The governor is laying claim to economic growth that doesn't exist," Hester said in an e-mail. "When legitimate figures show New Jersey ranking 47th in real GDP growth, then the governor needs to be held accountable for his own claims." First, let’s discuss that 47th place finish. On June 5, the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis released data on real gross domestic product in 2011 and preceding years for each state and Washington, D.C. Real GDP is an inflation-adjusted measure of a state’s economy. Between 2010 and 2011, real GDP in New Jersey declined by 0.5 percent, leaving that change in 47th place among the 50 states, according to the bureau. Only six other states saw a drop in real GDP, including Alabama, Mississippi and Wyoming, the bureau said. Still, it’s worth noting that, according to the bureau, real GDP in New Jersey increased by 1.5 percent between 2009 and 2010. That means during 2010 and 2011 -- the first two years of Christie’s tenure -- there was a net increase of 1 percent. Now, we’ll address whether it’s fair to blame Christie for the state’s economic performance in 2011. After reaching out to a few experts, it appears that the Democrats’ criticism is overblown. A governor can impact economic growth in a state, but there are several other factors at play, some experts said. James Alm, chair of the Department of Economics at Tulane University in New Orleans, La., told us "states (and state governors), while not powerless by any means to affect state growth, are also largely at the mercy of broader national trends, and even state trends that are outside their own control/influence." Phillip Swagel, professor in International Economic Policy at the University of Maryland, School of Public Policy, noted how New Jersey is considerably affected by the economic fortunes of Philadelphia and New York City. "Governor Christie likely has limited control over this, let alone over national economic trends," Swagel said in an e-mail. "This is not to say that the Governor’s policies would have no impact on the state economic situation, but just that there are many factors." Bruce Yandle, an adjunct economics professor at the Mercatus Center at George Mason University in Virginia, added in an e-mail: "It takes a miracle worker as governor to enter office and somehow magically cause the workforce and employment to expand immediately, and cause productivity to rise." Our ruling In a series of tweets, Greenwald blamed Christie for New Jersey ranking 47th in the nation for economic performance in 2011. With a 0.5 percent decline in real GDP in New Jersey, that ranking is accurate. As for Christie’s role, experts told us a governor can impact a state’s economic growth, but there are various other factors, including national and regional conditions.

pomt-02625	"And we’ve constantly been the lowest unemployed county in the state."	false	/oregon/statements/2014/jan/21/bob-terry/does-washington-county-constantly-have-oregons-low/	Former Oregon Congresswoman Elizabeth Furse filed two weeks ago for the District 4 seat on the Washington County Board of Commissioners. In doing so, she became the first to take on first-term incumbent Commissioner Bob Terry. Oregon Public Broadcasting contacted Terry to get his reaction to Furse’s announcement. In a brief interview, the Fisher Farms nursery owner said the county already is heading in the right direction, noting that the reserve fund is healthy and that the county carries little to no debt. He added this: "And we’ve constantly been the lowest unemployed county in the state." That’s impressive, if true. PolitiFact Oregon decided to check. We called Nick Beleiciks, a state employment economist, who walked us through a website containing the annual average unemployment rates by county. The data go back to 1990. Before that, only statewide figures were tracked, Beleiciks said. "Washington County had the lowest (or tied for the lowest) annual average unemployment rate in 1990, 2000, and 2006," he wrote in a follow-up email. "Washington County generally has the third or fourth lowest unemployment rate among Oregon’s counties. The county’s worst rank for unemployment rate was 9th lowest in 2009." So the county registered the lowest average annual unemployment rate in Oregon only three times in the past 23 years. The most recent figures, from November 2013, show Benton County’s 5.7 percent rate as lowest in the state. Hood River is second at 5.7 percent, with Washington County third at 6 percent. We called Terry to get his response. "There are two ways of interpreting that," he said. "When I was asked that question, I was thinking of the four-county region (Washington, Multnomah, Clackamas and Clark counties). Among those, it has consistently been the lowest. If you look at the entire state, which is what I actually did say, the proper word would be one of the lower. I’ll be more careful about how I state that in the future." He added, "You need to look at the population bases of the counties we’re talking about. None of them is anywhere near as big as we are. We are a leading contributor to the coffers of the state of Oregon." Washington County has long touted its economic vitality, with good reason. It’s home to some of the state’s biggest and most successful businesses, such as Nike, Intel, Tektronix and Columbia Sportswear. "Washington County does, in fact, have a very important place in Oregon’s economy," said Tim Duy, senior director of the Oregon Economic Forum at the University of Oregon. "Clearly, it has a large employment base with relatively high salaries." Mark McMullen, Oregon state economist, told us that the county’s computer and electronic producers alone account for more than 20 percent of overall Gross State Product, and the majority of GSP growth in recent years. Sliced another way, the county over the past four years has been responsible for one-third of all statewide wage and job gains, McMullen said. Terry is correct in talking about Washington County’s large jobs base. Its 260,900 jobs as of November 2013 dwarf, say, Hood River County’s 11,030 jobs. But those figures, while impressive, don’t support Terry’s statement about Washington County "constantly" leading the state in low unemployment rates. Statewide, Washington County has ranked third behind Benton and Hood River counties since November 2012, according to state data. Even looking just at the four-county metro area, to which Terry said he should have limited his comments, Clackamas County has had a lower annual unemployment average than Washington County five times since 1990. Twice, in 1999 and 2002, the counties tied. Terry noted, in follow-up comments, that Washington County has had and continues to have a significant role in powering the state’s economy. Two state economists and a wealth of data support that idea. But his claim to OPB was that the county has "constantly been the lowest unemployed county in the state." The county has led or tied for the lead in that category only three times in the past 23 years, though it has often had the third- or fourth-lowest rate. By saying "constantly," "lowest" and "in the state," Terry left himself no wiggle room. The numbers don’t bear out his initial claim. We rate it False.

pomt-03278	The federal deficit is "growing."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2013/aug/05/eric-cantor/eric-cantor-says-federal-deficit-growing/	During an interview on Fox News Sunday, House Majority Leader Eric Cantor, R-Va., took aim at red ink in the federal government. Cantor said, "What we are trying to do is fund the government and make sure also that we take away the kinds of things that are standing in the way of a growing economy (and) a better health care, and all the while keeping our eye focused on trying to deal with the ultimate problem, which is this growing deficit." There’s one problem: The federal deficit isn’t "growing." At least not now. First, a refresher on what a deficit is. If revenues are bigger than spending, you have a surplus. If spending is bigger than revenues, you have a deficit. According to the Congressional Budget Office, the federal deficit -- the amount by which the government has been spending more than it has been taking in -- has been declining since peaking in 2009: Fiscal year Deficit Deficit as percentage of GDP 2008 $459 billion 3.2 percent 2009 $1.413 trillion 10.1 percent 2010 $1.294 trillion 9.0 percent 2011 $1.296 trillion 8.7 percent 2012 $1.089 trillion 7.0 percent 2013 (projected) $ 642 billion 4.0 percent So, the deficit trendline has been generally downward, both in raw dollars and as a percentage of gross domestic product. And the CBO projects that the deficit will continue to go down for two more years: Fiscal year Deficit Deficit as percentage of GDP 2014 (projected) $560 billion 3.4 percent 2015 (projected) $378 billion 2.1 percent If CBO is on target, then by 2015, the deficit will be roughly a quarter of what it was in 2009. In other words, Cantor is wrong about what has been happening to the deficit, and what is projected to happen in the near future. After 2015, however, Cantor has a point -- the deficit begins growing again, according to CBO projections: Fiscal year Deficit Deficit as percentage of GDP 2016 $432 billion 2.3 percent 2017 $482 billion 2.4 percent 2018 $542 billion 2.6 percent 2019 $648 billion 3.0 percent 2020 $733 billion 3.2 percent 2021 $782 billion 3.3 percent 2022 $889 billion 3.6 percent 2023 $895 billion 3.5 percent "The current baseline has deficits growing again in 2016, and even with his proposed tax increases, deficits are set to begin growing again in the out-years under President Obama’s own budget proposals," said Rory Cooper, Cantor’s spokesman. Cantor, he said, "is equally concerned with this long-term deficit trend" as he is with the shrinkage of the deficit in recent years. We should also note that, despite the recent progress in shrinking the deficit, the federal debt continues to grow -- just more slowly than before. The debt refers to the accumulation of all prior yearly deficits, offset by any yearly surpluses. So until there’s a surplus -- and there hasn’t been one since fiscal 2001 -- the debt keeps growing. The public debt is projected to grow from $11.3 trillion in fiscal 2012 to higher than $19 trillion in 2023. As a percentage of GDP, the rise is more modest, from 72.6 percent of GDP in 2012 to 72.9 percent in 2023, according to CBO. Our ruling Cantor said that the federal deficit is "growing." Annual federal deficits are not growing right now, and they are not projected to grow through 2015, a point at which the deficit will have shrunk by three-quarters since 2009. By this standard, Cantor is wrong. However, unless policies are changed, deficits are projected to grow again in 2016 and beyond, according to the CBO. On balance, we rate his claim Half True.

pomt-14046	It "is Hillary Clinton's agenda" to "release the violent criminals from jail. She wants them all released."	pants on fire!	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/may/26/donald-trump/donald-trump-wrong-hillary-clinton-wants-release-a/	Donald Trump didn’t mince words about Hillary Clinton’s criminal justice agenda when he addressed the National Rifle Association’s national convention on May 20, 2016. "President Obama pushed for changes to sentencing laws that released thousands of dangerous drug trafficking felons and gang members who prey on civilians," Trump said. He continued, "This is Hillary Clinton's agenda, too, to release the violent criminals from jail. She wants them all released." We think most observers would agree that releasing every violent criminal in American prisons would amount to political suicide, not to mention bad policy. But we thought it was worth checking Clinton's actual policy prescriptions. What Trump said is far off-base. (The Trump campaign did not respond to an inquiry.) Existing criminal-justice reform efforts Trump said Clinton wants to continue Obama’s release of "thousands of dangerous drug trafficking felons and gang members." But Trump overreaches both on the substance of the policy and on Obama’s personal role in enacting it. In recent years, liberals and conservatives have increasingly found common ground over criminal justice reform. Many on the left, center and right -- including the libertarian Koch brothers and the generally more liberal American Civil Liberties Union -- have come to agree that many tough-on-crime policies instituted between the 1970s and the 1990s were misguided. They argue that policies such as mandatory minimum sentences and tough prosecution of low-level drug offenders have led to overcrowded prisons and exacerbated racial injustices. Obama has taken some steps to unwind these policies. Using his pardon powers, Obama has commuted the sentences of more than 200 inmates who had been convicted of drug crimes, though it’s important to note -- as Trump does not -- that all of them have been considered nonviolent under Justice Department guidelines. In addition, during Obama’s tenure, the Justice Department has approved the release of 6,000 federal inmates, about two-thirds of them to halfway houses or home confinement and about one-third who are expected to be deported. Unlike the commutations, these releases were prompted not by Obama but by the U.S. Sentencing Commission, an independent body. In unanimously approving the changes, the panel estimated that the reduced sentencing guidelines could eventually qualify 46,000 of roughly 100,000 drug offenders in federal prisons for early release, according to the Washington Post. (It does not affect the larger pool of offenders in state prisons.) And federal judges must approve all early releases. Though applicants for early release typically have a connection to drug trafficking, the releases are not intended to free drug-traffickers and gang members who have a record of violence, as Trump contends. Obama’s then-Attorney General Eric Holder actually proposed excluding convicts who had used weapons or had significant criminal histories, but the commission put its trust in judges to weigh those factors on a case-by-case basis, the Post reported. The commission submitted the proposal to Congress in April 2014, and Congress did nothing to stop the proposal from taking effect six months later. What Clinton supports Clinton does support criminal justice reform, but we found no evidence that her plan includes the release of "violent criminals," much less "all" of them. For starters, we should note that the Sentencing Commission’s action is now a done deal. Short of calling on the commission to reverse itself -- which the panel, being independent, could simply ignore -- or passing a law through Congress, there isn’t really anything Clinton (or Trump) could easily do to stop the forthcoming early releases. And of course, federal judges, not the president, are the ones who must sign off on applications for early release. More broadly, we looked at Clinton’s stated proposals for criminal justice policy and found that she focused her initiatives only on "nonviolent" offenders. The Clinton campaign said Trump’s comment is a misrepresentation of her views. On the criminal justice reform page of her website, Clinton summarizes her key proposals as follows: • "End the era of mass incarceration, reform mandatory minimum sentences, and end private prisons." • "Encourage the use of smart strategies — like police body cameras — and end racial profiling to rebuild trust between law enforcement and communities." • "Help formerly incarcerated individuals successfully re-enter society." It’s worth noting that Clinton focuses more on what happens before prison (such as sentencing of people not currently incarcerated) and after prison (especially reintegrating ex-convicts into society after they are released) than actually releasing current inmates. "Clinton has not focused on early release," said John H. Laub, a professor in criminology and criminal justice at the University of Maryland. For a politician, this is a canny omission, because it sidesteps difficult questions about who should be released early. "There is little consensus about releasing violent criminals from prison before their terms end," said Richard Rosenfeld, a professor of criminology and criminal justice at the University of Missouri-St. Louis. "Then there is the question of who is ‘violent.’ Someone who has a prior record for a violent crime but whose current charge is for a nonviolent crime. or only those with a current charge for violence?" But even if Clinton is sidestepping a thorny issue by remaining largely silent on which, if any, inmates deserve early release, that position does throw a wrench into Trump’s accusation that it’s her stated "agenda" to "release" violent criminals. If anything, Clinton’s policy page bends over backward to focus her attention on "nonviolent," rather than violent, offenders. Proposals specify "nonviolent" offenders no fewer than seven times. This consistent focus on nonviolent offenders undermines the notion that Clinton wants to release violent offenders at all, much less to do so willy-nilly. Our ruling Trump said it "is Hillary Clinton's agenda" to "release the violent criminals from jail. She wants them all released." It would be preposterous for any politician who wants to win an election to propose freeing every violent criminal from jail. Like many political figures today on the right, center and left, Clinton supports something much more modest — easing how the criminal justice system treats nonviolent offenders. That’s a far cry from saying Clinton is poised to set free everyone from Charles Manson to Unabomber Ted Kaczynski.

pomt-06592	"The water quality in the ocean is perfect. It’s been tested up and down every ocean shore in New Jersey."	mostly true	/new-jersey/statements/2011/sep/25/chris-christie/gov-chris-christie-says-jersey-shore-water-quality/	There’s a strip of coastline in the United States where the quality of the water is better than good, according to the governor. "The water quality in the ocean is perfect," Gov. Chris Christie said during a Sept. 2 press conference at Point Pleasant Beach, days after Hurricane Irene blasted through. "It’s been tested up and down every ocean shore in New Jersey." PolitiFact New Jersey found that while test results show the water is the best it’s been in years, some environmental experts disagree with Christie’s assessment. First, let’s look at how New Jersey reviews water quality. The state Department of Environmental Protection, in collaboration with local health departments, tests the water from Sandy Hook to Cape May each week from mid-May to mid-September, according to department spokesman Larry Ragonese. Water samples from swimming areas are tested for fecal coliform and other types of bacteria connected with sewage, stormwater runoff, and other pollutants, he said. The results, Ragonese said, have come back clean consistently since at least 2006, ranking Jersey shore waters above the 99th percentile of cleanliness on a scale of 100 percent. "There’s really been a concerted effort to really, really stress the importance of clean beaches," Ragonese said. In fact, New Jersey ranked second in the nation, behind New Hampshire, for ocean water quality in 2010, according to a June report by the National Resources Defense Council. The weekly tests check the levels of enterococcus, a bacteria normally found in the feces of people and many animals. Any level above 104 enterococci per 100 milliliters of sample is considered too high, according to state standards. PolitiFact New Jersey reviewed test results for beaches in Atlantic, Cape May, Monmouth and Ocean counties dating to 2005. We found that in most cases, water quality results have been their best since 2008, with the level of enterococci well below the state’s threshold. If a test sample exceeds acceptable bacteria levels twice, the beach is closed until the bacteria level falls into normal range, Ragonese said. Jill Lipoti, director of the Division of Water Monitoring and Standards for the DEP, said three beaches were closed all along the shore this summer. Still, three environmental groups challenged Christie’s claim of "perfect" water quality. Trenton-based Environment New Jersey pointed to low oxygen levels in the ocean and questioned the health of the water for marine life. Pollution in Barnegat Bay and beach closures due to pollution also are a concern, said Dena Mottola Jaborska, executive director of Environment New Jersey. "I think the governor does a disservice to citizens in the state when he makes statements like that," Jaborska said. "There are lots of issues with the ocean." Larry Levine, a senior attorney with the Natural Resources Defense Council in New York City, also said the Jersey shore’s water quality is not perfect. "Every coastal state has some degree of issues with water pollution at beaches," in part due to stormwater runoff from urban and suburban areas where raw sewage and overflow can combine in the same pipe en route to a sewage treatment plant, Levine explained. When heavy rains are more than the treatment plants can handle, an untreated mixture of sewage and runoff can be released into waterways that lead to the coast. "That’s an issue nationwide, not just in New Jersey," Levine said. Clean Ocean Action of Monmouth County also wouldn’t qualify the water as perfect, but credited New Jersey for taking steps toward improvement. "The ocean’s much better off than it has been in a decade and while some individual pollutants may still be low, we have taken in this state with the Legislature and the governor’s office many impressive first steps that are long overdue," said Sean Dixon, coastal policy attorney for Clean Ocean Action. "There’s always more to be done." Our ruling Encouraging people to return to the Jersey shore, Christie claimed the water quality is "perfect," and that frequent test results have been favorable up and down the coast. While test results show that the shore’s waters are better than in past years, some environmental organizations disagree with the governor’s assessment. We rate this claim Mostly True.

The Jan. 20 headline by a website called Reagan Was Right reads, "Soros, Obama and the Dems Ordered the Shutdown to Stage a Coup." Facebook users flagged this story as possibly providing false information, as part of the social network’s effort to combat fake news. The story accuses a number of Democrats of organizing an overthrow of the White House during the federal government shutdown. A supposed report from the Secret Service stated the possibility of a military coup against Trump. The article quotes Secret Service spokeswoman Sandy Batt as saying: "The leaked report is no different from the dozens of others we act on everyday. The sources have been identified and we will deal with the situation if it arises. The President is safe." The story also claims four dozen snipers have roosted on the White House roof, and the D.C. airspace is shut down to all military and civilian aircraft with the exception of normally scheduled flights to Dulles and Marine 1. None of this, however, is true. Transportation Security Administration (TSA) personnel are still reporting to work, and the Federal Aviation Administration has continued air traffic control. Flight delays are not expected, and FAA safety inspections will continue. The story claimed Sandy Batt as the spokesperson for the Secret Service, but there is no one by the name of Batt who speaks for the Secret Service. It also said that D.C. airspace is shutdown, but flights are running as normal. Reagan Was Right, the site behind the story, describes itself as a "whimsical playland of conservative satire." It’s other disclaimer reads: "Everything on this website is fiction." The site is affiliated with Christopher Blair, a Maine man behind who we’ve written about previously. Blair told us his websites are carefully curated social experiment designed to "feed the Hoverounders their daily need for hate and their undying urge to blame everything in the known universe on Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama."

pomt-06856	"One of the biggest polluters in our country is the Milwaukee Metropolitan Sewerage District."	false	/wisconsin/statements/2011/aug/03/jim-sensenbrenner/rep-jim-sensenbrenner-says-milwaukee-metropolitan-/	As a handler of human waste -- which it periodically dumps into Lake Michigan untreated -- the Milwaukee Metropolitan Sewerage District is less popular among some people than mosquitoes. But is the taxpayer-funded agency one of the nation’s largest polluters? On July 24, 2011, U.S. Rep. Jim Sensenbrenner, R-Wis., held a town hall meeting in Whitefish Bay, a Milwaukee suburb. A woman told the 33-year congressman she was "appalled at the continued gutting of good government regulation and awarding corporations who pollute and not holding them accountable," according to Patch.com, a website that covers community news. Sensenbrenner said corporations are not the only ones to blame, adding: "I get sick and tired of people saying that people are dumping sewage in our water when one of the biggest polluters in our country is the Milwaukee Metropolitan Sewerage District." Sensenbrenner later called MMSD a "disgrace," prompting applause as well as objections from the audience, based on a video clip posted on YouTube. But was the criticism on target? We’ll first point out that the sewerage district doesn’t generate the pollution in question; its job is to treat it. But sometimes the district is treated like other polluters. Federal and state regulators have taken action against MMSD and other sewerage districts when they dump more untreated sewage and storm water than their government permits allow. With $3.5 billion in capital assets to treat sewage and help control flooding, MMSD serves 1.1 million customers in 28 communities in southeastern Wisconsin. In 2011, the agency has budgeted $242 million in property tax money for capital projects and $82 million in sewer service fees for operations. Most people probably give the sewerage district little thought -- until heavy rainstorms bring news that MMSD has allowed millions of gallons of untreated sewage and storm water to flow into Lake Michigan and rivers. Large rainfaills lead to the so-called combined overflows because the agency closes the gates to its $1.3 billion deep tunnel when the accumulated water nears the tunnel’s 521-million-gallon capacity. The most recent episode occurred over two days in June 2011, when the sewer district said an estimated 170.5 million gallons of untreated waste water overflowed following storms. Overflows pose potential health risks. A 2010 study published by researchers at the Medical College of Wisconsin, the Great Lakes WATER Institute and the Children’s Research Institute found an estimated 11 percent increase in the number of emergency room visits by children for acute gastrointestinal illness four days after rainfalls. That study cited untreated sewage releases as only one potential link to the illnesses. However, a 2007 Medical College of Wisconsin study concluded that such untreated waste water releases were "potentially harmful" because, in two of six releases examined, the number of children who went to emergency room for diarrhea "increased significantly." Sensenbrenner has been critical of MMSD in the past. In 2003, he lambasted the EPA for giving MMSD a "clean water partner" award not long after the sewerage district had been reprimanded for dumping. In 2005, when Sensenbrenner requested $68 million in federal flood control funds for MMSD, he emphasized that the agency had dumped "billions of gallons of waste into Lake Michigan" over the previous 10 years. We asked Sensenbrenner’s spokeswoman, Amanda Infield, for evidence to back her boss’ claim about MMSD as a polluter and she he made three points. We asked Bill Graffin, MMSD’s spokesman, to respond and did our own research. MMSD’s dumping Infield said that from 1994 through late July 2011, MMSD dumped 24.2 billion gallons of untreated sewage and storm water into Lake Michigan. Graffin said that accurately quotes MMSD’s own statistics, which show that annual combined overflows have been as high as 4.38 billion gallons since 1994. That is down from overflows ranging from 7 billion to 9 billion gallons per year from 1990 through 1993. Graffin said three other Midwestern cities, Cleveland, Indianapolis and Chicago, all have larger annual overflows than Milwaukee, such that they are being forced to make major treatment upgrades because of enforcement action by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. Documents show that MMSD’s counterpart in Cleveland, which releases nearly 5 billion gallons of untreated sewage per year, agreed in December 2010 to spend $3 billion; and the City of Indianapolis agreed in 2006, when overflows were nearly 8 billion gallons per year, to spend $1.73 billion. That figure was reduced in December 2010 to save Indianapolis $444 million. In Chicago, MMSD’s counterpart is under fire for its sewage dumping into the Chicago River. According to a New York Times article, in May 2011 the EPA ordered state regulators to impose stricter water quality standards on the river; environmental groups filed a lawsuit charging that Chicago’s waste water agency regularly violates the federal Clean Water Act; and an environmental group named the Chicago River one of the "most endangered rivers" in the country. Conversely, MMSD was last part of a legal stipulation in 2001. The agency finished making upgrades to its facilities required under the stipulation in 2010, Graffin said. Graffin also cited a Milwaukee Journal Sentinel article on a 2006 study by the Sierra Legal Defense Fund, a Canadian conservation group. The article said Milwaukee was far from the worst polluter in the Great Lakes. The study gave Milwaukee a C-plus rating, ranking it in the top half of the 20 Great Lakes cities evaluated for sewage management. Milwaukee was at the top of all the large cities surveyed, according to the article. So, while MMSD sometimes does dump untreated waste water into Lake Michigan, Sensenbrenner provided no evidence comparing MMSD to other polluters. It’s also clear that in the Great Lakes area alone, Milwaukee is far from being the worst polluter. BP comparison Sensenbrenner’s spokeswoman said the amount of waste water MMSD dumped into Lake Michigan in one week was 10 times the amount of oil spilled by BP in the disastrous Gulf of Mexico spill in April 2009. She cited a news report from WTMJ-TV (Channel 4) in Milwaukee that said 2.1 billion gallons of untreated sewage and storm water were dumped into Lake Michigan following storms that caused flooding in July 2010. That amounted to about 75 percent of the overflows for the year. The 2.1 billion gallons is more than 10 times the 170 million gallons of oil spilled by BP in the Gulf of Mexico. But measurements don’t tell the whole story. One important difference: What MMSD dumps includes contaminants, but it is mostly water; BP spilled oil. A presidential commission that investigated the BP incident said in a January 2011 report that the spill was the largest accidental marine oil spill in U.S. history. The spill was so massive, the report says, that it will take decades just to assess the environmental damage, leaving aside the tens of billions of dollars in economic damage caused. So, aside from noting the difference in volume, Sensenbrenner provided no evidence to establish that one MMSD overflow was somehow worse than what is regarded as one of the nation’s worst environmental accidents. Spoiled beaches Sensenbrenner’s spokeswoman said southeastern Wisconsin has some of the most polluted beaches in the nation. She cited a 2011 report by the Natural Resources Defense Council, an environmental action group. The report labeled 13 beaches in seven states as "repeat offenders" for having high bacteria levels from 2006 through 2010. Two of the beaches were in southeastern Wisconsin, including one -- South Shore in Milwaukee -- that is in MMSD’s service area. The report does not mention the sewerage district but seems to implicate the agency, saying "chronically high bacteria counts indicate that the beach water is probably contaminated with human or animal waste." The Great Lakes WATER Institute at the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee says, however, that sewage overflows are not the primary cause of beach advisories and closings. The main causes at many Milwaukee-area beaches are waste from gulls and storm water runoff, according to the institute. In addition, the EPA said in a 2007 report to Congress that sewer overflows were the source of pollution in only 3 percent of the beach advisories and closings in Milwaukee County from 2000 to 2004. So, like the other points, that one does not stand up to scrutiny. We wondered whether there were rankings of the nation’s worst water polluters, but Josh Mogerman, spokesman for the Natural Resources Defense Council, said he was not aware of any. We did find a June 2011 report about MMSD by the Public Policy Forum, a government watchdog and research organization in Milwaukee. The report focused on the sewerage district’s financial condition. But it also found that, according to national data, MMSD’s "sewage and treatment capacity offers greater protection from sewage overflows than most other districts." So where does all of this leave us? Upset about how much untreated waste water goes into Lake Michigan, Sensenbrenner called the Milwaukee Metropolitan Sewerage District "one of the biggest polluters in our country." He cited the amount of dumping MMSD has done, but provided no evidence that it ranks among the nation’s top polluters. To be sure, MMSD does dump untreated sewage -- along with collected rainwater -- in the lake when its system reaches capacity. But Sensenbrenner’s claim was one of magnitude, comparing the district to all other polluters nationwide. We found evidence indicating that MMSD is not even among the worst sewerage district polluters in the Great Lakes region. We rate Sensenbrenner’s statement False.

pomt-10757	"We had a No Child Left Behind — a similar piece of legislation in our state a number of years ago, well before the federal law. And it's had a big impact here. It's improved schools."	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2007/oct/30/mitt-romney/mass-schools-did-improve/	The former Massachusetts governor made his comment in response to a question about Fred Thompson's opposition to the No Child Left Behind Act. Romney supports the federal accountability law, and has for some time. Why? Because he has seen the effects of holding schools accountable through testing and standards in his own state. He refers specifically to his state's landmark 1993 Education Reform Act, which put such measures in place nine years before No Child took effect. Romney said the law has had a "big impact." And he's right. In 1998, just 7 percent of high school sophomores were scoring at the "advanced" level on the state's math exam. By 2007, 41 percent of sophomores could make that claim. Over the same period, the percentage of sophomores failing the English exam dropped from 28 percent to 6 percent, with corresponding increases in the top ratings. In 2005 and again in 2007, the state ranked first, or tied for first, in all four test categories for a widely respected exam commonly known as "the nation's report card." The categories are math and reading for fourth and eighth grade. No state had ever done that well across the board. "In some respects, I would say you can track our success in Massachusetts to the fact that there was this issue of equity in education in the early 1990s," said Matt Militello, an assistant professor of educational policy at the University of Massachusetts. But the achievement gap persists. David Driscoll, the state's education commissioner in 2005, wrote that the state's performance gaps between white, black and Hispanic students remained unchanged since 2003. In 2007, the state's interim commissioner, Jeffrey Nellhaus, noted again that while the scores of white students were rising, those of black and Hispanic students were flat. Robert Costrell, Romney's former chief economist and education adviser, doesn't dispute the achievement gap. But he said that doesn't change the overall improvement. "The gaps are still quite significant and of great concern. But there absolutely was a closing of those gaps," said Costrell, now a professor of education reform and economics at the University of Arkansas. Ultimately, Romney claims the state made strong progress in education after it passed an accountability law similar to No Child Left Behind, and the test scores back him up.

pomt-09619	"The attorney general requires that rape victims pay for the rape kit."	pants on fire!	/texas/statements/2010/jan/12/barbara-ann-radnofsky/radnofsky-says-attorney-general-requires-rape-vict/	In her campaign to become the next attorney general of Texas, Democratic candidate Barbara Ann Radnofsky is using a crime-victim issue to attack her opponent, GOP incumbent Greg Abbott. In a video on her Web site, Radnofsky makes the provocative claim that "the attorney general requires that rape victims pay for the rape kit" — a reference to forensic examinations given to victims of sexual assault. We wondered whether Radnofsky's statement was true. This is what we found: Under current state law, sexual assault victims in Texas should never have to pay for their forensic exams, which are done by medical professionals to collect physical evidence for the investigation and prosecution of sexual assault suspects. Local law enforcement agencies are responsible for paying hospitals for rape kits in cases in which the victims report the crimes. Those agencies can seek reimbursement of up to $700 through the Crime Victims’ Compensation Fund, which is administered by the attorney general’s office. If a victim chooses not to report the crime, the Texas Department of Public Safety is responsible for paying for the exam and getting reimbursement from the fund. When asked about Radnofsky’s statement in the video, Torie Camp, deputy director of the Texas Association Against Sexual Assault, a victims advocacy organization, said, "That’s not true, and if any rape victims are paying for rape kits, that shouldn’t happen. State law is very clear on this issue, and the attorney general can’t trump state law to make rape victims pay for rape kits." But Texas law hasn't always read that way. In the past, rape exams were done by medical professionals and then paid for by law enforcement agencies only if sexual assault victims reported the crimes. The reauthorization of the Violence Against Women Act, signed by President George W. Bush in 2006, gave states three years to eliminate such reporting requirements so that all victims could obtain free forensic medical exams. In 2009, the Texas Legislature finally changed the law, directing the Department of Public Safety to cover the cost of a rape kit for any victim who chooses not to report. For Radnofsky, that change took too long. She says that Abbott could have -- and should have -- acted earlier to bring administration of the victims' compensation fund into compliance with the federal act. A spokesman for Abbott's office says the attorney general did not have the authority to change a policy that was mandated by state law. When asked if she knew of any instances when victims had paid for their own rape kits, Radnofsky said she did not. But she isn't the first person to wade into this gnarly issue. In May, a Houston television station aired a report, picked up by CNN, that caused an uproar in the advocacy community because it implied that sexual assault victims were being billed for forensic exams, Camp said. In response, both the attorney general’s office and TAASA issued public statements that termed the TV story inaccurate and misleading. The attorney general's office said that as of Jan. 1, the office had paid for 57,702 rape exams since December 2002 and had not denied any requests for reimbursements for the kits from law enforcement agencies. TAASA said the TV report implied that billing victims for their rape kits "was a common practice in Texas despite being told by several sources … that this was not the case. … The problem is there isn’t really a problem." Officials from other organizations that deal directly with sexual assault victims, including SafePlace and the Austin Police Department’s sex crimes unit, also said that they were not aware of any large-scale problems with victims receiving bills for forensic exams. That leaves this question: Before the Texas law was changed, did sexual assault victims who did not want to report a crime have to pay for their forensic exams? No, according to officials contacted for this story. In those cases, victims were not given the exams to begin with, so payment was not an issue. However, hospitals have sometimes mistakenly sent bills to victims for their forensic exams, according to the attorney general’s office. But none of the officials we contacted knew of any data on how often that happens. Summing up: Regardless of whether Abbott took the initiative on this issue and regardless of whether some sexual assault victims have been mistakenly billed on occasion, Radnofsky’s claim is wrong. The attorney general does not require rape victims to pay for rape kits and never has. That's why we give Radnofsky a Pants on Fire.

Rick Santorum says he’s the only consistent conservative in the Republican presidential field, but a new Ron Paul campaign ad says the label is phony. Paul’s ad calls Santorum a "counterfeit conservative" who, among other sins, "funded Planned Parenthood." We decided to check whether Santorum, well known for his opposition to abortion and even contraception in some instances, supported government funding of the controversial women’s health provider. A look at the funding When we contacted Paul’s campaign for backup, his spokesman provided us a list of votes that Santorum -- and Paul -- made on large appropriations bills for the Department of Health and Human Services and other federal departments. The bills including funding for something called Title X. According to the Health and Human Services website, Title X provides "comprehensive family planning services." With an emphasis on serving low-income Americans, the services are defined as "contraceptive services and related counseling" as well as "preventive health services such as: patient education and counseling; breast and pelvic examinations; breast and cervical cancer screening according to nationally recognized standards of care; sexually transmitted disease (STD) and Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) prevention education, counseling, testing and referral; and pregnancy diagnosis and counseling. By law, Title X funds may not be used in programs where abortion is a method of family planning." Despite the ban on using federal funds for abortions, critics (including Paul) say the funds are "fungible," meaning even though government dollars don’t pay for abortions directly, the funding frees other money that can be used for abortions. The bulk of Planned Parenthood’s work involves routine women’s health care -- pelvic exams, STD testing and counseling and contraceptives. It is also the country’s biggest abortion provider and a significant recipient of Title X funds. Santorum’s votes The list Paul’s campaign sent us shows votes on appropriations bills from 1996, 1997, 1998, 2001, 2002, 2003, 2004, 2005 and 2006. In each case, Santorum voted for the bills, and Paul voted against. Looking closely at the bill from 2006, Santorum’s last HHS appropriations vote in the Senate, the $142.5 billion spending package allocated money for everything from the human genome project to aging services, from the black lung disability trust fund to the Corporation for Public Broadcasting. As for Title X: "$285,963,000 shall be for the program under title X of the Public Health Service Act to provide for voluntary family planning projects." Santorum’s response We didn’t hear back from Santorum’s campaign for this story. But he has spoken on the topic in interviews and debates, explaining that while he personally opposes the use of contraceptives, he supports their availability as a matter of public policy. Talking to CBS on Feb. 17, 2012, Santorum said, "It’s funny that I’ve been criticized by Governor Romney and by Ron Paul for actually having voted for something called Title X, which is actually federal funding of contraception. … My public policy beliefs are that this contraception should be available. Again, I’ve supported Title X funding. I’ve also supported abstinence-based education because I believe that is a healthier alternative." During a debate in Arizona on Feb. 22, 2012, Santorum struggled to explain his position of having voted for the funding while declaring opposition to it: "As Congressman Paul knows, I opposed Title X funding. I've always opposed Title X funding, but it's included in a large appropriation bill that includes a whole host of other things, including the funding for the National Institutes of Health, the funding for Health and Human Services and a whole bunch of other departments. It's a multi-billion-dollar bill. "What I did, because Title X was always pushed through, I did something that no one else did. Congressman Paul didn't. I said, well, if you're going to have Title X funding, then we're going to create something called Title XX, which is going to provide funding for abstinence-based programs, so at least we'll have an opportunity to provide programs that actually work in -- in keeping children from being sexually active instead of facilitating children from being sexually active. And I pushed Title XX … to accomplish that goal. … As president of the United States, I will defund Planned Parenthood; I will not sign any appropriation bill that funds Planned Parenthood." Our ruling Paul’s ad says Santorum funded Planned Parenthood. His campaign points to Santorum’s yea votes in the Senate on massive appropriations bills for funding the federal government. Title X funding, which funnels family planning dollars to health care providers including Planned Parenthood, was in those spending measures. Santorum has been unclear about where he stands on Title X, saying in one instance that he supports Title X and in another that he opposes it. In any event, he did not vote separately for Title X but for omnibus multi-billion dollar appropriations measures that funded many other activities. Saying, as the ad does, that he "funded Planned Parenthood," makes it sound like he played a larger role than being one of many votes in favor of a broad-based appropriations bill. In 2006, for instance, he was joined by all but two of his Senate Republican colleagues in voting for the bill. Paul's statement is partially accurate but it leaves out that important context. We rate the claim Half True.	None	Ron Paul	None	None	None	2012-03-01T17:57:48	2012-02-28	['Rick_Santorum']
pomt-10266	"More than 12,500 service men and women have been discharged on the basis of sexual orientation since the "Don't Ask, Don't Tell" policy was implemented, at a cost of over $360 million. Many of those forced out had special skills in high demand, such as translators, engineers, and pilots."	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/aug/25/democratic-national-committee/a-claim-on-"dont-ask-dont-tell"-stands-up/	The Democratic Party's draft platform , entitled Renewing America's Promise, promises to repeal the military's "Don't Ask, Don't Tell" policy. That policy grew out of a furious political battle in the early days of President Bill Clinton's administration, when he considered lifting the Pentagon's longstanding ban on gays in the military. Under a compromise that took effect in 1994, the military would not ask about servicemembers' sexual orientation, and gay persons could serve as long as they were silent about that aspect of their lives. The DNC platform says "Don't Ask, Don't Tell" wastes money and disqualifies valuable personnel. Under the heading, "Allow All Americans to Serve," the platform says: "We will also put national security above divisive politics. More than 12,500 service men and women have been discharged on the basis of sexual orientation since the 'Don't Ask, Don't Tell' policy was implemented, at a cost of over $360 million. Many of those forced out had special skills in high demand, such as translators, engineers, and pilots. At a time when the military is having a tough time recruiting and retaining troops, it is wrong to deny our country the service of brave, qualified people. We support the repeal of 'Don't Ask, Don't Tell' and the implementation of policies to allow qualified men and women to serve openly regardless of sexual orientation." Since the DNC justified its position with statistics, we want to see if those statistics hold up. The claim that "more than 12,500 service men and women have been discharged on the basis of sexual orientation since the 'Don't Ask Don't Tell' policy was implemented" seems to be accurate. The Pentagon was unable to provide us promptly with its count, but a February 2005 Government Accountability Office report said 9,488 servicemembers had been ousted for homosexual conduct between the start of the policy in 1994 and the end of fiscal year 2003. When we asked the Democratic National Committee where the number came from, they referred us to the Obama campaign, which in turn sent us to the Servicemembers Legal Defense Network, an advocacy group for gay servicemembers. The group's spokesman, Adam Ebbins, said it files Freedom of Information Act requests each year to get the most recent number, and that the last count, as of the end of fiscal year 2007, was 12,342 members discharged, with no response from the Coast Guard. "At this point we are confident that the number of discharges has exceeded 12,500," Ebbins said. He said the military documents supporting that number were too cumbersome to provide promptly, but by our count the GAO report suggests a discharge rate of 2.6 service members per day, which would place the current total well over 12,000. So the defense network's number is quite plausible, and we see no reason to question it. Onto the DNC's claim that "many of those forced out had special skills in high demand." The GAO report said 757 of those discharged for homosexuality, or 8 percent, held "critical occupations," meaning jobs worthy of selective reenlistment bonuses, and of those 322 had some skills in important foreign languages such as Arabic, Farsi or Korean. So yes, that qualifies as "many," and the claim was accurate. The third aspect of the party's claim – that the policy cost more than $360 million – is less clear. It seems odd to us that a debate of this sort would bog down over money; we suspect those who feel strongly on either side of this debate believe it should be decided on issues such as equality or military readiness, not cost. Nevertheless, volumes have been written on the cost of the policy, so let's have at it. In its 2005 report, the GAO said that over the 10-year period it "could have cost" the Department of Defense $190.5 million to recruit and train replacements for servicemembers lost due to the policy. But the office cautioned that "the total costs of DOD's homosexual conduct policy cannot be estimated because DOD does not collect relevant cost data on inquiries and investigations, counseling and pastoral care, separation functions, and discharge reviews." A year later the Michael D. Palm Center at the University of California, Santa Barbara, wrote a competing financial Analysis of "Don't Ask Don't Tell" , and concluded that the policy cost at least $363.8 million between 1994 and 2003. The DNC used that number. The California commission comprised former Secretary of Defense William Perry, a former assistant defense secretary, two former military officers, a military law expert, and six professors (including two from West Point and two from the Naval Postgraduate School). It had its research design and report reviewed and vetted by Mary Malina, a professor at the Graduate School of Business and Public Policy at the Naval Postgraduate school, and an expert in cost accounting, management control systems and managerial accounting practice. The commission found that the GAO overestimated one aspect of the cost of the policy – adding the cost of replacing those fired for being gay but failing to offset that with the value recovered through the time served by the replacement. In two other respects, though, the GAO underestimated the cost, the commission found. It did not include the cost of training officers who were discharged for homosexuality, and for enlistees, it used an inaccurate estimate of training costs per person. Bottom line: the California commission came up with a cost 91 percent higher than the GAO's. The GAO fired back, critiquing the commission's report in July 2006. It said 90 percent of the gap between its estimate and the commission's was due to differing estimates of enlistee training costs. "Our estimate focused largely on the direct and incremental training costs associated with the specific occupations of servicemembers," the GAO wrote. "The Commission based its estimate on average training costs for all occupations indexed for inflation." The office defended its estimated in other respects as well, and stood by its number. The California commission chair, University of California associate political science professor Aaron Belkin, answered back in September 2006 with a critique of the GAO's critique of his critique of their report. Still with us? Belkin said that in its defense of its estimate the GAO did not "acknowledge the implications of its failure to obtain length-of-training data" and "misrepresents its own training cost data." We're getting way into the weeds here, and as Belkin said in an interview, "With any accounting story you have multiple truths because accounting can be calculated in different ways." That said, two factors compel us to approve of the DNC's claim that the policy has cost over $360 million. For one thing, both the GAO and the California estimates are now five years out of date, and even the GAO's methodology would yield an estimate much higher than $190 million today – it might well even reach $360 million. Secondly, the GAO acknowledged in its 2005 report that it was not trying to provide a complete estimate – in fact, the title of its report was "Financial Costs and Loss of Critical Skills Due to DOD's Homosexual Conduct Policy Cannot Be Completely Estimated." The California commission did endeavor to provide a complete estimate, and it drew on extensive expertise to do so. Therefore, its estimate is the best available measure of the cost of "Don't Ask, Don't Tell." So we find the Democratic Party's claim to be True.

pomt-12477	Says the Republican plan to replace Obamacare, "absolutely does not eliminate protections for pre-existing conditions."	mostly false	/north-carolina/statements/2017/may/04/robert-pittenger/does-new-version-ahca-protect-coverage-pre-existin/	One of the key sticking points over U.S. House Republicans’ plan to repeal and replace Obamacare is what will happen to people with pre-existing health conditions if this new plan passes. North Carolina Republican Rep. Robert Pittenger supports the bill. He said Tuesday that people still would be able to buy health insurance even if they already have cancer, heart disease, diabetes or some other type of health issue. One of the biggest changes in the Affordable Care Act, or Obamacare, was a requirement that insurers cannot reject people on the basis of pre-existing conditions or charge them exorbitant rates for their premiums. "The American Health Care Act absolutely does not eliminate protections for pre-existing conditions," Pittenger said. However, that is misleading. It’s an issue that affects many people, too. According to the nonpartisan Kaiser Family Foundation, more than one in four Americans between 18 and 64 has a pre-existing condition – including more than 1.6 million people in Pittenger’s state of North Carolina. Of those, 86,000 North Carolinians with pre-existing conditions buy their insurance through the Obamacare marketplace, according to Avalere, a Washington, D.C, health care consulting company – as do nearly 2.3 million people nationwide. President Donald Trump made a similar claim to Pittenger’s, saying on April 30 that "pre-existing conditions are in the bill." PolitiFact rated that Mostly False. Pittenger made his claim two days later. However, nothing changed in that time regarding the AHCA’s proposed rules for protecting people with pre-existing conditions. So Pittenger’s claim misses the mark, too. Weakening current protections The AHCA does keep the requirement that people with pre-existing conditions must be offered health insurance. But it would drop Obamacare’s rules capping how much extra those people can be charged. The part of the AHCA dealing with pre-existing conditions is the MacArthur Amendment, named after Republican Rep. Tom MacArthur of New Jersey. (See PolitiFact’s full analysis of the amendment here.) Compare two of the amendment’s key provisions: See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com So it appears people wouldn’t pay wildly different rates due only to their gender, which is also the case under Obamacare. But by contrast, insurers would only have to provide access to coverage for people with pre-existing conditions. It says nothing about the rates of that coverage. That means if the AHCA passes, it would allow for people with pre-existing conditions to be charged more per year for their insurance coverage – possibly to the tune of thousands or even tens of thousands of dollars more per year, some studies have found. The exact amount might differ regionally, since some states might not allow the higher rates. Pittenger said that if the AHCA passes and people want better health insurance, they could move to a different state. How the changes work Matt Fiedler, a health care analyst for the Brookings Institute, said the AHCA would force people with a pre-existing condition to choose between two different pools of insurance coverage, both with "a very high premium." "In either case, people with serious health conditions would lack access to affordable insurance options," he said. The AARP opposes the AHCA for that reason. So does the nation’s largest group of doctors, the American Medical Association, which said the AHCA will do "serious harm to patients and the health care delivery system." Upton amendment and high-risk pools For people with pre-existing conditions, states could allow insurers to charge more if they set up a high-risk pool or participate in a new federal invisible risk-sharing program. Medical professionals question the quality of care those pools would provide. "The history of high-risk pools demonstrates that Americans with pre-existing conditions will be stuck in second-class health care coverage – if they are able to obtain coverage at all," said Dr. Andrew Gurman, president of the American Medical Association. Ten groups that advocate for patients – including the American Cancer Society and American Heart Association – also issued a joint statement in opposition. They said in the past, high-risk pools "resulted in higher premiums, long waiting lists and inadequate coverage." One of Pittenger’s fellow Republicans, Rep. Fred Upton of Michigan, initially said the AHCA "torpedoes" pre-existing condition protections. But Upton changed his mind Wednesday after House leadership set aside an extra $8 billion, spread over five years, to subsidize people whose premiums skyrocket. However, there's disagreement as to whether the money is enough. And it’s not clear who would be eligible to receive subsidies, how much they could receive or how much they would be required to pay on their own. Our ruling Pittenger said that the Republican AHCA health care plan "does not eliminate protections for pre-existing conditions." While insurers technically would still be required to offer coverage to people with pre-existing conditions, the AHCA would weaken protections for those people. Insurers would be able to charge people significantly more if they had a pre-existing condition like heart disease, cancer, diabetes or arthritis – possibly requiring people to pay thousands of dollars extra every year to remain insured. We rate this claim Mostly False.

pomt-00751	"The elimination of essentially every automobile would be offset by one volcano exploding."	false	/wisconsin/statements/2015/apr/17/mike-huebsch/new-wisconsin-utility-regulator-says-volcanos-wors/	Questions about climate change shouldn’t have been a surprise at the confirmation hearing for Michael Huebsch to join the Wisconsin Public Service Commission. After all, the state agency regulates electricity prices, power plant construction and the development of wind and solar power. All play a role in the amount of carbon emissions that utilities generate in Wisconsin. Huebsch, a former Republican state lawmaker, served as secretary of the Department of Administration under Gov. Scott Walker, who appointed him to the PSC. The question came up during the end of Huebsch’s April 7, 2015 appearance before the Senate Committee on Natural Resources and Energy. State Sen. Mark Miller (D-Monona) asked Huebsch for his views about "whether or not our activities in terms of energy generation are contributing to climate change?" Huebsch responded that humans have can have an impact on climate change, but said he didn’t believe it is "anywhere near the level of impact of just the natural progression of our planet." He added: "You know, the elimination of essentially every automobile would be offset by one volcano exploding." That one, well, erupted on social media. Critics questioned the science behind the claim, which has been repeated numerous times by those who do not believe human activity is causing the planet to warm. When we asked Huebsch for his evidence, he responded by forwarding us an email he had sent to Miller after the hearing. "I answered a question you put to me inaccurately and I want to set the record straight," Huebsch wrote. "To your question regarding global climate change I indicated global volcanic activity can equal the emission output by the automobiles in the United States. That is inaccurate and I apologize for the error." He added: "While the scientific community recognizes the natural impact on climate change due to carbon (CO2)and sulfur (SO2) emissions from volcanic activity, those emissions do not equate to the annual emissions from United States automobiles and other fossil fuel based transportation. I apologize for any confusion this may have caused." Oh. All that said, let’s take a closer look the comparison. Volcanoes: A frequently cited 2011 report by Terrance Gerlach, a volcano expert with the United States Geological Survey, compared carbon emissions from volcanoes and all human activity -- not just motor vehicles. The eruption of Mount Pinatubo in the Philippines in 1991 was one of the largest ever recorded. That event sent about 0.05 gigatons into the atmosphere. Vehicles: According to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, greenhouse gas emissions from vehicles in the United States amount to 27 percent of all sources of greenhouse gases, second only to electric power generation. Gerlach’s report says that vehicles worldwide contributed 3 gigatons a year in greenhouse gases. The EPA estimate puts the U.S. share of that at just under 2 gigatons. By either measure, that’s far, far more that a volcanic eruption. The Gerlach report contained this conclusion: "Do the Earth’s volcanoes emit more CO2 than human activities? Research findings indicate that the answer to this frequently asked question is a clear and unequivocal, ‘No.’" Our rating Huebsch, the latest appointee to the agency that regulates utilities in Wisconsin, testified that "the elimination of essentially every automobile would be offset by one volcano exploding." When we asked about his comments, Huebsch issued an email saying his answer to the climate change question was wrong, and apologized. We rate his claim False.

pomt-06166	"I balanced the budget for four straight years, paid off $405 billion in debt."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/dec/16/newt-gingrich/newt-gingrich-repeats-claim-about-his-record-balan/	During the Dec. 15, 2011, Republican presidential debate in Sioux City, Iowa, Newt Gingrich touted his record when he was speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives. Gingrich’s comment came after moderator Bret Baier said that former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney "just yesterday said you're an unreliable conservative. Now, obviously, he's your opponent. … But even Iowa Gov. Terry Branstad said today he respects you greatly, but he openly questioned whether you had the discipline and focus to be president." Gingrich responded, "Well, those are two different questions. .... I have a 90 percent American Conservative Union voting record for 20 years. I balanced the budget for four straight years, paid off $405 billion in debt. Pretty conservative. … I think on the conservative thing, it's sort of laughable to suggest that somebody who campaigned with Ronald Reagan and with Jack Kemp and has had a 30-year record of conservatism, is somehow not a conservative?" The claim that Gingrich "balanced the budget for four straight years (and) paid off $405 billion in debt" sounded familiar. It turns out that we originally fact-checked it when Gingrich made it on May 11, 2011, when he released a video to launch his presidential campaign. In that video, he said, "for four years, we balanced the budget and paid off $405 billion in debt." With soft music in the background, Gingrich said with a smile, "We’ve done it before. We can do it again." Gingrich was speaker from January 1995 to January 1999, when he was a Republican congressman from Atlanta’s suburbs. First, the balanced budget. The federal budget runs on a fiscal year calendar that begins October 1 and ends September 30. During fiscal years 1996 and 1997 -- the first two that Gingrich helped shape as speaker -- there were deficits: $107 billion in 1996 and about $22 billion in 1997. By fiscal year 1998, the federal budget did reach a surplus of $69 billion. And in fiscal year 1999 -- which Gingrich can claim some responsibility for, even though he was out as speaker for most of the fiscal year -- it was in surplus as well, to the tune of $126 billion. But that’s only two balanced budgets he can claim credit for. The federal government did run four consecutive surpluses, but for the last two of those -- fiscal years 2000 and 2001 -- Gingrich was no longer serving in the House. Now for Gingrich’s comments about the debt. The national debt was slightly above $4.8 trillion when Gingrich became House speaker in January 1995. By the time he left the position in January 1999, the debt was more than $5.6 trillion. That’s an increase, not a decrease. If you look just at the two years Gingrich can claim credit for where the federal government was in surplus -- fiscal years 1998 and 1999 -- the government did pay down about $200 billion in debt. But that would be cherry-picking, because over the full four years of his speakership, the debt rose by about $800 billion. A final note: It’s PolitiFact’s policy not to focus solely on the accuracy of the numbers in political attacks (or, as in this case, efforts to claim political credit) but also to determine whether blame or credit for the results is justified. With this statement, even if Gingrich’s numbers had been correct, his language suggested that he deserved sole credit for the achievement, when in fact it was a collective accomplishment with a Democratic president, Bill Clinton, and the Republican-controlled U.S. Senate. That further downgrades the accuracy of his claim. Our ruling Gingrich was off on both claims concerning the budget. The budget was indeed balanced for four years, but it’s a stretch for him to take credit for more than two of those years. As for paying off $405 billion in debt, the data we found shows the debt actually increased during Gingrich’s four-year tenure as speaker by more than $800 billion. We rate Gingrich’s claim False. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/322a0d22-442b-41c1-9415-76fe52d38a5e	None	Newt Gingrich	None	None	None	2011-12-16T08:21:18	2011-12-15	['None']
pomt-14489	"Our community (Tampa Bay) is one of the 10 most threatened by the sea level rise in the world."	mostly true	/florida/statements/2016/feb/26/sierra-club/tampa-bay-among-top-10-regions-most-threatened-cli/	The head of Tampa Bay’s Sierra Club chapter warned the Hillsborough County Commission that building more roads will only make global warming’s consequences worse for the entire region. Chapter chairman Kent Bailey told commissioners in a Feb. 22, 2016, letter that the Sierra Club would not be supporting a proposed half-cent transportation sales tax referendum known as Go Hillsborough. Bailey said the measure doesn’t set aside enough money to pay for expanding mass transit. He argued that adding more roads and more cars to an already congested system will only make matters worse by increasing carbon pollution. "Our community is one of the 10 most threatened by the sea level rise in the world," Bailey wrote. He added that the Tampa Bay area will be among the first to suffer from flooding caused by climate change. There’s no doubt the oceans are rising, and Tampa Bay will feel the effects. But is the region among the most endangered in the world? Let’s just say that we found the bay area has a lot to lose. Flooding vs. sea level rise There are a bunch of ways to measure how climate change will affect the world’s cities. People will be displaced, economies will be ruined, or you may end up with not enough water (or too much). These are all issues Tampa Bay faces, so buckle up. When we asked Bailey how he came up with his ranking, he said he was referring to potential property losses, mostly in terms of real estate. "We can move our people. But our fixed assets are a different story," he said. He cited several sources, including a report from global-warming researchers Climate Central, and a Scientific American article that said St. Petersburg was in particular danger from sea level rise. He also pointed to a 2008 paper from the international Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. The study focused on the effects of climate extremes on port cities — particularly storm surge. Coastal flooding is different than sea level rise, but experts told us Bailey is using a fair benchmark for comparison. Vulnerability to storm surge and sea level rise often are conflated in discussions on climate change, they said. "They are related, but not exactly the same," said Ben Strauss, vice president for sea level and climate impacts at Climate Central. In general, sea level rise can make a big impact on flooding, and will assuredly make storm surges and flooding worse in the future. David Hastings, a marine science professor at Eckerd College in St. Petersburg, said storm surges are especially dangerous in Tampa and St. Petersburg because of the relatively shallow offshore shelf in the Gulf of Mexico. Higher sea levels will make surges even more dangerous. But back to the OECD study: Economists examined 136 port cities and found that Tampa and St. Petersburg together were among the 10 cities with the most property at risk to wind damage and coastal flooding from storm surge. And that’s for right now, let alone after sea levels increase. "The top 10 cities in terms of assets exposed are Miami, Greater New York, New Orleans, Osaka-Kobe, Tokyo, Amsterdam, Rotterdam, Nagoya, Tampa-St. Petersburg and Virginia Beach," the paper read. Those rankings could get better if steps were taken to mitigate flooding, the study said. But they could also get worse, as cities grow and gain more people. The effects of subsidence (the physical earth below the city changing or sinking, which is a major issue in Tampa Bay) and the changing climate could magnify the risk, too. Many of the same economists revisited the rankings in a 2013 study published in the journal Nature Climate Change. Tampa-St. Petersburg came in as the seventh-most at risk of flooding. If you’re looking for a price tag for how much Tampa Bay stands to lose, the OECD has one: In a catastrophic, once-in-100-years flood, losses to the region currently could be $49.6 billion. University of South Florida oceanography professor Gary Mitchum noted real estate losses are only part of the story. As the oceans rise permanently, the region’s tourism-based economy will suffer extensively. Many people who can afford to simply move away probably will, but low-wage workers dependent on disappearing service industry jobs will be stuck. Of course, the region’s property loss ranking may change some as population, planning and even geography shift. But these are from economists, considering economic impact. If we examined this another way — say, how many people will be permanently displaced by the eventual coastal floods that won’t recede — other places will have it much worse than Tampa Bay. Even the OECD researchers said their rankings would be different by that measure. Cities in China and southeast Asian countries, like Bangladesh and Vietnam, will be much more affected that way. It’s much harder to quantify how the human toll will affect regions because you can’t easily attach a dollar amount to it. "The social impact of this is much more complicated," Mitchum said. "The result that you get depends on how you assess it." Our ruling Sierra Club's Bailey said, "Our community (Tampa Bay) is one of the 10 most threatened by the sea level rise in the world." He cited credible research that showed the region is among the most at risk of property damage from coastal flooding. He’s conflating that research with the effects of sea level rise, but several experts told us the problems are related. It's striking that Tampa Bay is already in great danger when it comes to potential property loss, but Bailey should have been more specific. There are other ways to measure the consequences of rising oceans beyond real estate. When we consider some of these factors, other major cities could be considered worse off than Tampa Bay. The statement is accurate but needs clarification. We rate it Mostly True.	None	Sierra Club	None	None	None	2016-02-26T14:24:38	2016-02-22	['None']

He was right that there is no affirmative right to vote spelled out in the U.S. Constitution, though several amendments aim to prohibit discrimination based on race, sex and age. Pocan is back again seeking a constitutional amendment guaranteeing a right to vote, in hopes of making it more difficult for states to impose rules on voting, such as having to present a photo identification in order to cast a ballot. And he got our attention again during an April 19, 2015 news conference where he explained his thinking on the need to update the Constitution. "If you think about it, when the Constitution was written, 20 to 25 percent of the people in the country could vote," Pocan said. "White male property owners over 21 is a very small subset of the country." Is Pocan is accurately describing the state of voting eligibility in 1787, when the founding document was signed? Opening the history books Pocan directed us to excerpts from "The Suffrage Franchise in the Thirteen English Colonies in America," an oft-cited 1905 book by Albert McKinley. Like many other sources, the book describes the difficulty in pinning down the size of the pool of potential voters in part because states set their own rules. After all, the constitution had not been signed, so there were no national standards. "In Pennsylvania the tax-list figures give only potential voters, but they show about eight per cent of the rural population qualified for the suffrage, and only two per cent in the city of Philadelphia," McKinley wrote. "In Rhode Island the freemen or potential voters numbered only nine percent of the population." The potential voters seem to vary from one-sixth to one-fiftieth of the population," he concluded, after warning that "these figures are entirely too few, and too scattered in time and territory, to justify any accurate generalization from them." Several experts we turned to for help said Pocan’s estimate was in the right range. Voting in the late 18th century was restricted to males and generally based on landownership, and did not extend to slaves who were a fifth of the population, said Andrew J. O'Shaughnessy, a University of Virginia historian and vice president of the Thomas Jefferson Foundation. The proportion of men who could vote rose in the early nineteenth century as voting restrictions were eased. By early in the century, on average probably 50 percent to 60 percent of white adult males could vote, which would be around 20 percent of the total white population, he said. Steven Mintz, a history professor at the University of Texas at Austin, put the voting pool at about 18 percent of the adult population. He based his view on evidence cited in "The Right to Vote: The Contested History of Democracy in the United States," authored in 2000 by Alexander Keyssar, a Harvard University historian. Keyssar, too, told us that Pocan’s claim is roughly accurate. "It should also be noted that not all states had property requirements," Keyssar said. "In a few, there were tax requirements, and Vermont had no financial qualification for voting." Mintz has written that leading colonists associated democracy with disorder and mob rule, and felt that only property owners or taxpayers "were committed members of the community and were sufficiently independent to vote." "Many colonies imposed other restrictions on voting, including religious tests," Mintz wrote. "Catholics were barred from voting in five colonies and Jews in four." On the other hand, O’Shaughnessy said in an interview with writer Ed Crews that by 18th century standards, "Americans enjoyed considerable voting rights," and that even in Britain, with its elections and representative government, voting practices tended to be unfair, uneven, corrupt, and far more restrictive than America's." Our rating Pocan said, "When the Constitution was written, 20 to 25 percent of the people in the country could vote." Pocan’s estimate is defensible based on a variety of sources, with the caveat that this is tough territory for statistical precision. We rate his claim Mostly True.

pomt-07787	"75 percent of the jobs created in the state of Ohio are created in small business. They are not created by huge corporations and those who are very wealthy."	mostly true	/ohio/statements/2011/feb/21/bill-batchelder/ohio-house-speaker-william-g-batchelder-says-small/	The term "small business" covers a range of seven different size categories, ranging from a two-person mom-and-pop grocery store to a factory with nearly 500 employees. Which is why researchers at the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics chuckled when we asked them about a statement Ohio House Speaker William G. Batchelder made about small businesses creating new jobs. Appearing on WCPN 90.3 FM’s "Sound of Ideas" program, Batchelder noted the importance of small businesses in Ohio’s economy. "Seventy-five percent of the jobs created in the state of Ohio are created in small business. They are not created by huge corporations and those who are very wealthy," Batchelder said. PolitiFact Ohio thought that sounded interesting and we put the Truth-O-Meter to work. We started by contacting the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Researchers there cited statistics that showed 99 percent of all private sector companies in the United States are considered small businesses, according to the definition used by the Small Business Administration. It categorizes any firm that employs 499 or fewer people as a small business. Traditionally, the number of people employed by small businesses has been about the same as the number who work for businesses of 500 people or more, said Brian Headd of the SBA’s Office of Advocacy. That category would include large factories, like auto plants and steel manufacturers. As of last year, the majority of workers had tipped toward small businesses, which employed just under 55 percent of the nation’s workforce, the BLS’s most recent statistics showed. We also checked with Batchelder’s office about the source of the speaker’s statement. Spokesman Mike Dittoe gave us two: The National Federation of Independent Business’s Ohio office in Columbus, and a March 2010 report prepared by Headd titled, "An Analysis of Small Business and Jobs." Roger Geiger, NFIB/Ohio’s executive director, both confirmed Batchelder’s statement and also referred us to the Headd report. Headd also echoed Batchelder’s sentiment that small businesses are important to the nation’s economic health. He points out how one in five employees at small firms work part-time, and how a greater percentage of Hispanics, high school students, disabled, elderly, and rural employees work at small businesses. Headd also noted that more than half of all companies start out small, stay small and close after a few years, accounting for 85 percent of job turnover in the country -- which is not necessarily a bad thing. Headd considers the hefty job changes experienced in small businesses to be beneficial and a natural outgrowth of a healthy economy. "Although job turnover can be an emotional roller coaster for individuals, small firm job flows are a boon to the economy," Headd wrote in his report. "This churning represents the economy’s constant evolution from outmoded processes and industries to more productive ones," a process he calls "creative destruction." Headd sees small businesses as key to the nation’s recovery from the recession of 2009. "With the labor market struggling in recent years, small businesses are a logical group to look to for job recovery as they have such a large role in net job creation," he wrote. BLS researchers confirmed that their most recent statistics indicated that 75 percent of all new hires nationwide were made by small businesses in the second quarter of 2010. Over the past eight years, small businesses made 65 percent of all new hires in the United States, they said. And of small business job creation, nearly three out of four new workers were hired at companies with less than 20 employees. But what about Ohio? Do the state’s small businesses mirror the national trend? Benjamin Johnson of the Ohio Department of Job and Family Services had data from the federal government on the most recent statewide breakdown, by county, of the total number of workers employed in Ohio, but could not provide specific information to verify Batchelder’s claim that "75 percent of the jobs created in the state of Ohio are created in small business." Geiger, in the Ohio office of the National Federation of Independent Business, didn’t have Ohio-specific data either. And the BLS told us they didn’t track that data, either. But researchers there made a point of saying they were sure Batchelder’s statement was essentially correct. As one pointed out: 99 out of 100 employers are classified as small businesses, so saying 75 percent of all new jobs in Ohio are created by small businesses is hardly different than saying ALL businesses create ALL jobs. So the experts who deal with labor statistics back up Batchelder’s claim, but we also note that the absence of specific data on Ohio jobs is a point that provides clarification. On the Truth-O-Meter we rate Batchelder’s statement as Mostly True.	None	William G. Batchelder	None	None	None	2011-02-21T11:45:00	2011-02-04	['Ohio']
pomt-02945	In Massachusetts, "half of the primary care doctors are not accepting new patients."	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2013/oct/29/john-fleming/gop-rep-john-fleming-says-massachusetts-half-prima/	As the fallout from President Barack Obama’s health care law takes center stage, some critics are raising concerns about how much access Americans will have to insurance and physicians in the future. On CNN’s State of the Union, Rep. John Fleming, R-La., a physician and a critic of Obamacare, and Ezekiel Emanuel, a health policy specialist at the University of Pennsylvania who supports the law, faced off. At one point, they debated the situation in Massachusetts, where a law similar to Obamacare was signed in 2006. As evidence that the federal law won’t work, Fleming said that in Massachusetts, "half of the primary care doctors are not accepting new patients." His point was that even if you have insurance, you won’t necessarily be able to see a doctor. We decided to check Fleming’s statistic to see if it’s correct. The statistic comes from an annual survey by the Massachusetts Medical Society, a professional association founded in 1781 that, among other things, publishes the prestigious New England Journal of Medicine. The 2013 edition of the society’s "Patient Access to Care" survey -- which was based on 1,137 phone interviews with Massachusetts physicians -- found that 51 percent of family medicine practitioners in the state were accepting new patients. As Fleming indicated, almost exactly half are not. We will point out a few caveats, none of which seriously undercut Fleming’s claim. • While "family medicine" is certainly one type of "primary care doctor," there are others. One type, internal medicine doctors, had a lower percentage (45 percent) accepting new patients, but another, pediatricians, had a higher percentage (70 percent). • There is substantial regional variation even within Massachusetts. The largest county in the state, Middlesex, had more doctors accepting new patients, at rates five to eight percentage points higher than the state as a whole. Other counties, such as Suffolk, had rates well below the state average. • Your likelihood of being accepted as a new patient depends heavily on what kind of insurance you have. Family medicine doctors accept 90 percent of new Medicare patients and 70 percent of patients with MassHealth, the state’s vehicle for Medicaid and Children’s Health Insurance Program. The 2013 survey did not look at new-patient acceptance rates for those who had private insurance or for patients with Commonwealth Care or Commonwealth Choice, the programs created under the 2006 law to insure those who previously had no insurance. However, data from the society’s 2011 survey does show a danger sign for those worried that doctors will be unwilling to take patients newly insured by the national health care law. The 2011 survey found that family medicine physicians were significantly less likely to accept new patients with Commonwealth Care or Commonwealth Choice -- 56 percent and 44 percent, respectively -- than they were new Medicare and Medicaid patients. Equally striking, the survey found, the percentage of family doctors taking new patients with any type of insurance has fallen since 2007 from 70 percent to 51 percent. That said, determining whether Massachusetts is out of line on any of these benchmarks is tricky, since comparable data for other states is virtually nonexistent, and the available national data is calculated differently and is several years old. Our ruling Fleming said that in Massachusetts, "half of the primary care doctors are not accepting new patients." That number is supported by a credible annual survey of Massachusetts doctors. While this doesn’t necessarily mean the same thing will happen on the national level, the statistic is solid. We rate it True.

pomt-10996	Say "Pope says that the rights of Muslim migrants trump any safety concerns that you might have with them in your country."	half-true	/punditfact/statements/2018/jul/12/blog-posting/blog-post-twists-popes-words-about-migrants-and-na/	Did Pope Francis say that the rights of Muslim migrants are more important than any country’s safety concerns about them? That’s what a largely plagiarized story on the website opreminfo.com claimed. But what he said was more nuanced. Facebook flagged this story as part of the company’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) So we decided to investigate. It turns out that a large part of the article is copied, word-for-word, from a 2017 Reuters article titled, "Pope says migrants’ rights should override national security concerns." The only differences between the two are that the opreminfo.com article omits the final two paragraphs of the Reuters story, and it also has a different headline singling out Muslim migrants. Reuters is a reputable source, and a 2017 Guardian article corroborates much of their story. But this recently posted article has a few problems. First, there's an issue of timing. The story begins with the statement, "Pope Francis urged political leaders on Monday to defend migrants." The Reuters article began with those same words, but it was published in August 2017, and was referring to a message the pope put out that same month, ahead of the Roman Catholic Church’s World Day of Migrants and Refugees. In it, the pope reiterates an earlier address and says, "Our shared response may be articulated by four verbs: to welcome, to protect, to promote and to integrate." He then goes on to describe the task of "welcoming" as follows: "Once again, I want to emphasize the importance of offering migrants and refugees adequate and dignified initial accommodation … The principle of the centrality of the human person, firmly stated by my beloved predecessor, Benedict XVI, obliges us to always prioritize personal safety over national security … The situation of migrants, asylum seekers and refugees requires that they be guaranteed personal safety and access to basic services. For the sake of the fundamental dignity of every human person, we must strive to find alternative solutions to detention for those who enter a country without authorization." The opreminfo.com article, published July 10, 2018, refers to that message. However, it says the pope "urged political leaders on Monday," even though the pope’s remarks were published nearly a year ago. Secondly, the Reuters article makes no reference to "Muslim migrants." Rather, it mentions that the pope called for "broader options for migrants and refugees to enter destination countries safely and legally." We didn’t find any reference to Muslim migrants in the pope’s message. Our ruling An article on Facebook claimed, "Pope says that the rights of Muslim migrants trump any safety concerns that you might have with them in your country." The pope discussed ensuring all migrants' "personal safety over national security." But this article cherry-picked a subgroup of migrants to make it seem like he was only talking about Muslims. In addition, the text of the article is copied from a 2017 Reuters article, even though it is framed as though the speech happened recently. For a partially accurate claim that takes things out of context, we rate this headline Half True. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com	None	Bloggers	None	None	None	2018-07-12T11:56:13	2018-07-10	['Islam']
pomt-10544	He's been endorsed by "every major newspaper here in the state of Texas."	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/feb/22/barack-obama/they-like-him-in-texas/	At the Democratic debate in Austin, Texas on Feb. 21, 2008, Sen. Barack Obama responded to criticism that he was little more than a good speaker by saying that he had broad support from voters and newspapers. He said he has received many endorsements, "including every major newspaper here in the state of Texas." He's right. We checked and found he has been endorsed in the primary race against Sen. Hillary Clinton by the seven largest newspapers in Texas. Here are samples of what they said: Houston Chronicle: "Obama vows to reach out to independents and Republicans with a message of inclusion and cooperation. He offers a historic opportunity to elevate national political dialogue to a higher ground. Those who insist on vitriol and obstructionism would be marginalized." Dallas Morning News: "Americans are tired of divisive, hard-edged politics. Democrats would inspire a refreshingly new approach by choosing Mr. Obama as their 2008 candidate." Austin American-Statesman: "His optimism, unifying vision and ability to inspire are the kind of healing balm the country needs at this moment in history." San Antonio Express-News: "America needs a president that tries to create unity out of diversity, marshalling all the forces — red, blue or purple — that make this country great. Sen. Barack Obama is the Democratic candidate that offers the best chance to reach that lofty objective." Fort Worth Star-Telegram: "Obama might be shorter on detail, but he is by far longer on inspirational spirit, charisma and an ability to energize previously unengaged Americans in the voting process, particularly the usually unengaged up-and-coming generations on whose shoulders America's future rests." Corpus Christi Caller-Times: "The Editorial Board endorses Sen. Barack Obama because it believes that he offers the kind of inspirational leadership the country is hungry for." El Paso Times: "A weary America, tired of the status quo, fed up with business as usual, is longing for a positive change — and Barack Obama is that change."

pomt-05776	"Amniocentesis, does, in fact, result more often than not in this country in abortion."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/feb/27/rick-santorum/rick-santorum-says-amniocentesis-does-fact-result-/	Republican presidential candidate Rick Santorum opposes requiring insurers to pay for a type of invasive prenatal testing called amniocentesis, saying it results "more often than not in this country in abortion." The test, which doctors offer as an option to pregnant women, uses a long needle to remove a small amount of fluid from the sac that surrounds a fetus. While the test carries a less than 1 percent risk of miscarriage, it can be used to diagnose gene and chromosomal disorders, neural tube defects, blood disorders and infections. Santorum told Face the Nation host Bob Schieffer that it’s used to "recommend abortion." "Amniocentesis does, in fact, result more often than not in this country in abortion," he explained during the CBS News interview on Feb. 19, 2012. We wondered, does the diagnostic test "result more often than not in this country in abortion"? We reached out to government agencies, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, the Guttmacher Institute, the March of Dimes and the Christian Medical & Dental Associations. There’s no national source any of these groups knew of that tracks amniocentesis procedures and their outcomes. But there’s good evidence Santorum overstated his case. The interview In Santorum’s Face the Nation interview, host Schieffer referred to a comment Santorum had made on the campaign trail in Columbus, Ohio. Schieffer said, "You sound like you're saying that the purpose of prenatal care is to cause people to have abortions, to get more abortions in this country. … Any number of people would say that's not the purpose at all." Santorum responded, "Well, Bob, that's simply not true. The bottom line is that a lot of prenatal tests are done to identify deformities in utero, and the customary procedure is to encourage abortions. … You said prenatal care. I didn't say prenatal care shouldn't be covered. We're talking about specifically prenatal testing, and specifically amniocentesis, which is a procedure that actually creates a risk of having a miscarriage when you have it and is done for the purposes of identifying maladies of a child in the womb. In many cases, and in fact most cases physicians recommend, particularly if there's a problem, recommend abortion. We know, Bob, that 90 percent of Down syndrome children in America are aborted." After mentioning his daughter Bella’s diagnosis with the serious chromosomal disorder Trisomy 18, Santorum added: "We had a sonogram done there and they detected a problem. And yes, the doctor said, you know, you should consider an abortion. "This is typical, Bob, this is what goes on in medical rooms around the country. And yes, prenatal testing, amniocentesis, does, in fact, result more often than not in this country in abortion. That is a fact." Separately, we checked Santorum’s statement from the same interview that "90 percent of Down syndrome children in America are aborted." (We found that Half True — some regional studies bear him out, but the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists says it’s difficult to generalize for the entire nation.) Here, we’re focusing on his statement, "Amniocentesis, does, in fact, result more often than not in this country in abortion." The data We asked Santorum’s campaign for support for his claim, but didn’t hear back. We would have appreciated some guidance, because as we mentioned, no government agency or major professional group we found tracks amniocentesis and parents’ choices afterward. We checked with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the National Institutes of Health, who referred us to the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development. "Our scientific staff notes that there is no national source that tracks amniocentesis procedures, and the NIH does not have any information on the proportion of cases in which amniocentesis is performed and which subsequently end in pregnancy termination," Robert Bock of the National Institute of Child Health & Human Development told us. The Guttmacher Institute, which does research on sexual and reproductive health, including abortion, doesn’t keep data on parents’ choices after amniocentesis. Neither does the March of Dimes, which offers information about genetic disorders and birth defects. That left the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, a professional group with 52,000 members. It doesn’t collect data on amniocentesis procedures, either. But a spokesman did refer us to an expert in prenatal diagnosis. The researchers That means checking this claim comes down to individual studies and researchers who study parents’ responses to prenatal diagnosis. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists suggested we speak with Mark Evans, a professor of obstetrics and gynecology at Mount Sinai School of Medicine. He’s also president of the Fetal Medicine Foundation of America, president of the International Fetal Medicine and Surgery Society Foundation and past president of the Central Association of Obstetricians and Gynecologists. He noted something that other experts we talked with also quickly pointed out: More than 90 percent of the time, the results of amniocentesis are normal, and parents go on to have healthy children. So, based on that, Santorum is incorrect. Meanwhile, when doctors do find a problem, only about half of patients choose to end their pregnancies, Evans said — and there’s a direct relationship between the severity of the problem and parents’ choice. There’s also a direct relationship between the region parents live in and the choices they make — something we pointed out in our rating about Down syndrome. "In liberal areas such as New York, probably 80 to 90 percent of parents with severe abnormalities do choose to terminate when legal to do so. In conservative areas, the proportion of termination is much lower — perhaps as little as 10 percent," Evans said. So Santorum might have been right if he had focused only on amniocentesis that results in diagnosis of a severe abnormality in liberal regions of the U.S. But his statement was much broader. Evans argues, in fact, that prenatal diagnosis allows for more healthy babies, both because accurate diagnoses help doctors treat fetuses with problems (he’s helped pioneer such in utero procedures as a stem-cell transplant for a fetus with a severely compromised immune system), and because accurate testing helps parents at high risk for passing on serious genetic abnormalities to confidently continue their pregnancies. "These are women who would not have otherwise gotten pregnant," he said. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists points out that in the case of a definitive diagnosis of a chromosomal abnormality, such as Down syndrome, the doctor and family have information to plan ahead for the rest of the pregnancy, labor and delivery. (That’s something former vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin, who chose to have an amniocentesis, has said she was grateful for before the birth of her son, Trig.) Meanwhile, experts we spoke with disagree with Santorum that doctors "encourage" abortions. Prenatal diagnosis itself is an optional procedure, pointed out Miriam Kupperman, a professor of obstetrics, gynecology and epidemiology at University of California at San Francisco. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists merely recommends that testing be offered as an option to every pregnant woman. Invasive procedures, such as amniocentesis, are typically only conducted after screening such as a blood test shows a fetus is at higher risk. After diagnosis of an abnormality, abortion would be presented among a parent’s options, along with any possible treatment. Gene Rudd, an obstetrician/gynecologist and senior vice president of the Christian Medical & Dental Associations, said that day-to-day reality doesn’t always bear out such even-handed counseling — either before patients choose invasive procedures such as amniocentesis or afterward. "I just don't think they are being properly informed," he said. "It's just so routine that when patients these days are given the option of giving the blood test, it's almost like it's not presented as an option. … Once that test is positive, the knee-jerk reaction is, you need an amniocentesis." Like Santorum, Rudd said he’s concerned about mandating free coverage for amniocentesis because of its small risk of miscarriage and the fact that parents may choose to end their pregnancies based on a diagnosis. Still, the test can provide useful information in some cases when parents want to keep their pregnancies, he said. "There are a few conditions where the prenatal diagnosis can be important," he said. "There are some preparatory things that make good sense. People can rationally choose to have amniocentesis for that. … I think that's admirable when people want to choose to do that." Our ruling Santorum told Face the Nation, "Amniocentesis does, in fact, result more often than not in this country in abortion." While no agency or organization we spoke with keeps national statistics, researchers and reports we consulted show that more than 90 percent of amniocenteses result in normal diagnoses — and thus often healthy babies. Meanwhile, perhaps half of parents whose fetuses are diagnosed with abnormalities — mostly those with the most severe, untreatable problems — may go on to end their pregnancies. So by the best evidence available, perhaps less than 5 percent of parents who choose amniocentesis choose to end their pregnancies. Santorum’s statement isn’t accurate, and we rate it False.

pomt-14889	"Our state has no major rivers to produce big hydropower."	mostly true	/georgia/statements/2015/nov/10/tim-echols/wading-question-hydropower-georgia/	Anyone who has ever visited Niagara Falls has a very clear idea of the power of water. But the same might be said about the Chattahoochee River for anyone who has ever decided to explore some of the whitewater. So a recent claim made by one member of the Georgia Public Service Commission, in touting the state’s commitment to nuclear power, caught our attention. "Our state has no major rivers to produce big hydro power," Commissioner Tim G. Echols wrote in Power Engineering, a magazine that covers the power generation industry. "What we do have is nuclear power, and it enjoys widespread support." No major rivers? And what is "big" hydro? PolitiFact Georgia decided to check Who decides? We reached out to Echols, who cited both state and federal reports to back up his claim. The 2014 Georgia Energy Report by the Georgia Environmental Finance Authority said that hydroelectric generated 2 percent of power generation and 5.5 percent of capacity in 2012, Echols said. And a 1998 report for the U.S. Department of Energy evaluated "undeveloped hydropower potential" and found Georgia’s undeveloped hydropower potential was between about 613 megawatts and 1,137 megawatts of power. Large-scale hydropower is more than 30 megawatts in size. Each of the two nuclear units being built at Plant Vogtle, which we will get to in a moment, will generate about 1,117 megawatts each. "So, if we extracted every last megawatt of potential hydropower that has been identified in Georgia, we would equal the output of a single nuclear reactor under the most favorable interpretation," Echols said. "In a more realistic scenario, we could generate roughly 60 percent of that." Rivers run through it Part of whether the statement makes sense falls on whether Georgia has any "major" rivers. As any elementary school student can tell you, many towns and cities developed alongside rivers throughout the nation’s history, with the waterways serving as transportation for people as well as goods. The Chattahoochee, Savannah and Suwannee are the major rivers in Georgia. The Hooch is the state’s longest, flowing about 435 miles. There are 13 dams along the Chattahoochee, designed to both regulate flow and generate hydropower. By comparison, 56 dams built exclusively for hydropower sit in the Columbia River Basin, which stretches for 1,240 miles. Hydropower supplies about half of the electricity used in the Northwest - about 8,664 megawatts a year. So, Georgia may have major rivers, by our own state standards, but those rivers may not necessarily be major in terms of water-power electric generation. Peach State energy Georgia, like many states, is in the midst of a big shift in how it generates that electricity. The move has been away from coal as the primary fuel and into cleaner, greener options. Years ago, Georgia Power committed to building two new nuclear reactors at its Vogtle site south of Augusta. The project is years behind schedule and well over budget but, once done, will allow nuclear to grow beyond the 9 percent of capacity it accounted for as of the third quarter this year, according to Georgia Power. Nuclear is small in capacity terms, especially compared to the 32 percent capacity from coal and 49 percent from natural gas. But it’s almost double the 5 percent capacity from hydropower, the electricity generated from 18 plants Georgia Power operates across the state. Capacity versus energy From that perspective, neither hydropower nor nuclear appears "big" energy generators. (In hydropower’s case, it’s not big relative to other regions of the country). But experts look not only at the capacity, or how much could be provided, but at energy, or what is actually generated to meet the need. Looking at it that way, hydro appears even smaller, accounting for 5 percent of capacity but just one percent of energy, said Georgia Power spokesman John Kraft. Nuclear, meanwhile, accounts for 9 percent of capacity but generated 19 percent of the energy in the third quarter. And, as we mentioned, Georgia Power has put its money behind nuclear. The company has not sought to build a new hydroelectric facility since the mid-1970s and last brought two units online in 2005 as upgraded replacements for long-used plants, Kraft said. "Many of the prime hydroelectric generation locations in Georgia are now in use. In addition, the rivers that flow through Georgia originate in Georgia, therefore, their drainage basins are relatively small," Kraft said. "The really large river systems such as the Columbia, Ohio and Tennessee include multiple states in their drainage basins and have much larger hydropower potential." Outside view It’s not just the company that thinks so. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers is one of the world’s largest suppliers of hydroelectric power. By the Corps calculations, Georgia Power has about 340 megawatts of capacity on the Chattahoochee and some smaller power generation elsewhere in the state. The Corps has another 350 megawatts of capacity on the Chattahoochee, too. But those plants are usually the "last on, first off" resources to meet demand. Nuclear plants operate continuously, making direct comparisons difficult, said spokeswoman Lisa Parker. "I feel that Georgia does have major rivers that have been developed by USACE and GPC for peak hydropower," Parker said. "It does not have major rivers that could support large base load hydropower, such as the Columbia River." Still, the U.S. Department of Energy’s updated hydropower assessment found in 2014 that the south Atlantic-Gulf region, including Georgia, had untapped potential for another 2,561 megawatts of power. Our ruling In explaining Georgia’s support of nuclear energy, Public Service Commissioner Tim Echols wrote in a trade publication that the state has no "major rivers to produce big hydropower." In the most simple terms, Georgia does have major rivers where hydroelectric plants are a key part of the mix in meeting the state’s energy demands. As a percentage of power generation, hydropower is destined to remain a relatively small part of that mix given the limitations of our rivers compared to massive waterways in places such as the Pacific Northwest. There is some room for growth in hydroelectric, which Echols’ statement ignores, even if other energy sources will always dominate. We rate Echols’ statement Mostly True.

pomt-02013	The Obama administration "went to court to keep one of these five in jail at Guantanamo just three years ago because he was such a huge risk."	half-true	/punditfact/statements/2014/jun/08/stephen-hayes/conservative-columnist-says-obama-fought-keep-tali/	The merits of the prisoner exchange that resulted in the release of Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl from his Taliban captors continued to be a point of contention on this week’s political Sunday shows. On Fox News Sunday, panelists debated the potential political fallout in the midterms and the 2016 elections from President Barack Obama’s decision to swap five high-level Taliban officials from the military prison in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, for Bergdahl. Stephen Hayes, a columnist for the conservative Weekly Standard, said he thought Obama’s maneuver would be "politically problematic." "I think at a very base level, people who aren't following politics day in and day out, are looking at this Guantanamo five and saying, ‘Why in the world would we do this?’" Hayes said. "And the conflicts that we're hearing within the administration's own story. The administration went to court to keep one of these five in jail at Guantanamo just three years ago because he was such a huge risk, such a risk to U.S. national security. And now they're letting him walk. Those are the things you don't have to have a Ph.D. in national security studies to understand." Did Hayes find an example of the administration insisting one of the detainees was a risk, and then letting him walk free? (PolitiFact looked at the five freed prisoners in more detail here.) We asked Hayes to make the case to us. He showed us a recent column he wrote on Mullah Khairullah Khairkhwa, one of the five men released to Qatar in the Bergdahl deal. He also sent us a link to a 2011 court case where he said the United States argued for continued detainment of Khairkhwa, a former Taliban governor, spokesman and Minister of the Interior. But this wasn’t Obama’s Justice Department going to court to keep Khairkhwa in jail because he was "such a huge risk," as Hayes said. Actually, Khairkhwa, captured in 2002, was appealing for his release, saying he was being held illegally. In 2008, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that Guantanamo Bay detainees had the right to challenge the legality of their confinement. At question wasn’t whether the Obama administration considered Khairkhwa a risk. They didn’t have to prove that. In fact, the court makes that clear in its ruling: "The government's authority to detain an enemy combatant is not dependent on whether an individual would pose a threat to the United States or its allies if released." This stemmed from a 2010 court decision, Awad vs. Obama, in which Adham Mohammed Ali Awad, a Yemeni national, argued that he was no longer a threat to the United States and therefore his detention was unlawful. But the court said that wasn’t an issue. Rather, the Obama administration simply had to prove that, under the Authorization for Use of Military Force granted by Congress, Khairkhwa was a member of the Taliban or al-Qaida or associated forces at the time of his capture. The United States had ample evidence to make their case. Khairkhwa was part of the Taliban’s highest governing body and was a known associate of Osama bin Laden. Therefore, most of the administration’s case against Khairkhwa is centered on his past ties to the Taliban. There is no discussion of the risk he may or may not pose if he returned to Afghanistan. "It’s fair to say whoever said that hasn’t read the decision," said Mark Denbeaux, a law professor at Seton Hall University who has represented multiple Guantanamo Bay prisoners. "It doesn’t say that it’s the U.S. trying to keep them here, it’s the U.S. defending the standard that someone is a lawful enemy combatant." "The hearing (for Khairkhwa) took six years, and it concluded that he was a combatant for the Taliban, not that he was a terrorist," he added. "They didn’t even need to find out if he had attacked Americans." That’s not to say the government did not view Khairkhwa as a risk. There were varying opinions on that from within the administration. In documents released by Wikileaks, the Department of Defense labeled Khairkhwa as "high risk" and warranted continued detention. Khairkhwa, according to Wikileaks documents, was highly intelligent and may have known more about "the inner workings of the Taliban than any other detainee held." The administration, however, also once considered releasing Khairkhwa, who is a friend of Afghanistan president Hamid Karzai, in an effort to bring peace between the Taliban and the new Afghanistan government. The military considered him "as more of a civilian than a military figure," according to Reuters. Our ruling Hayes said the Obama administration "went to court to keep one of these five in jail at Guantanamo just three years ago because he was such a huge risk." We’re not assessing whether the Obama and the Pentagon viewed Khairkhwa as a "risk" if he was released. We’re looking at the rationale Hayes offered as to why the Obama administration went to court. Hayes said a 2011 court case was evidence of a "conflict" in the administration’s story. Actually, that court case had nothing to do with Khairkhwa's risk level. In fact, the court explicitly said assessing whether Khairkhwa was a threat if released wasn’t a factor at all. Instead, the administration was simply confirming that Khairkhwa was tied to the Taliban after he claimed that he was being held illegally. Hayes is right that the Obama administration argued to keep Khairkhwa in Guantanamo, but he misrepresented why they did so. We rate his statement Half True.

pomt-12609	"Muslims get their way--Illinois will permit wearing burqas in driving licenses photos"	pants on fire!	/illinois/statements/2017/apr/02/blog-posting/fake-news-claims-muslims-can-wear-burqas-drivers-l/	We came across a headline and provocative photo on the truetrumpers.com website that suggested Illinois officials would permit Muslims to have photo IDs taken for driver’s licenses with their faces completely covered by burqas. We decided to check out the claim as part of International Fact-Checking Day. "Muslims get their way--Illinois will permit wearing burqas in driving licenses photos," the headline reads. PolitiFact Illinois examined the origins of this claim as part of the inaugural International Fact-Checking Day, April 2, 2017. Organizers at Poynter.org describe the day as "not a single event but a rallying cry for more facts - and fact-checking - in politics, journalism, and everyday life." Dave Druker, spokesman for Illinois Secretary of State Jesse White, whose office administers driver’s license testing and issues Illinois IDs, quickly dismissed the claim. "That is not the case and the face must be exposed," he said. In fact, Druker noted, it’s now standard procedure, whenever a resident seeks to renew their driver’s license, that their old license picture is scanned and run through facial recognition software in an attempt to determine they are who they say they are and that they are not wanted for any serious crimes or listed on any terrorism watch lists. Muslims may cover the tops of their heads when their pictures are taken for state IDs, Druker said, but faces must be exposed. "The face has to be exposed," he said. "You can have your head covered. The top of your head. The face must be exposed. An orthodox Jew could wear a skull cap. A nun could wear the habit, but the face must be exposed." Druker said he was asked about the same fake news claim from a site about a year ago. This claim came from a website called TrueTrumpers.com that is not a credible news media site. It includes several posts that fuel fake claims about President Donald Trump, former President Barack Obama and Muslims, in particular, as well as click-baiting claims about porn stars and secret tricks for weight loss and whiter teeth.

pomt-00007	"#Broward elections department has a history of violating the law."	mostly true	/florida/statements/2018/nov/12/marco-rubio/marco-rubio-says-broward-elections-office-has-hist/	As Florida headed toward multiple recounts, U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., went on a Twitter tear directed at Broward Supervisor of Elections Brenda Snipes. Rubio took aim at the supervisor in on of Florida’s blue bastions as the county was still tabulating ballots more than 40 hours after the polls closed. Big races for U.S. Senate, governor and state agriculture commissioner hung in the balance. "#Broward elections department has a history of violating the law," Rubio tweeted Nov. 8, linking to Politico articles about two lawsuits filed against the office since 2016. Hours later, there was yet another lawsuit filed against Snipes, this time from Gov. Rick Scott, the Republican U.S. Senate candidate. A Broward judge ruled in Scott’s favor and found Snipes was in violation of Florida public records laws for not fulfilling a record’s request by Scott’s campaign. Is Rubio right about Broward’s past of election problems? Former Gov. Jeb Bush appointed Snipes, a former school principal, to replace Miriam Oliphant. Oliphant was removed from office amid mismanagement in 2003 following a string of problems in the 2002 primary election. Snipes initially drew praise for cleaning up the office and has repeatedly won re-election. But in recent years, she has faced scrutiny about her competence amid a series of lawsuits, errors and sluggish vote counting. Broward’s left-leaning electorate is key in statewide races because it has the second-largest number of registered voters with nearly 1.2 million, behind Miami Dade. Lawsuits filed against Broward Supervisor of Elections The lawsuits that Rubio cited were filed in 2017. Snipes lost both lawsuits and has appealed them. One lawsuit was filed by Tim Canova after he lost a Democratic primary to U.S. Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz in 2016. Canova, concerned about the integrity of the election, wanted to inspect the paper ballots after he lost. He said she refused to comply, and he sued. Snipes testified that her office had destroyed the ballots after she signed an order Sept. 1, 2017 to authorize destruction of boxes. But under federal law, ballots are supposed to be preserved for 22 months. Broward Judge Raag Singhal ruled in May against Snipes, finding "premature destruction of the records unlawful and in violation of the Public Records Act." Following the ruling, the state announced it would send election experts to monitor her office. The other lawsuit was filed by the Republican Party of Florida in 2017 and pertained to Snipes’ procedures for opening mail-in ballots. GOP poll watchers said in 2016 her office opened mail in ballots in private. In August before the 2018 primary, Singhal issued a declaratory injunction that prevented Snipes from opening the ballots before the county’s Canvassing Board met. However, Singhal wrote that the lawsuit pertained to handling of ballots in future elections, and not whether Snipes violated state law in past elections. We sent the judges’ findings in both lawsuits to experts on elections law and government. Chris Sautter, a recount expert and adjunct lecturer at American University, said that in the Canova case, "destroying ballots clearly violates federal law." With respect to the Republican Party of Florida case, declaratory injunctions are a common remedy courts use to compel public officials to perform duties they are not performing, Sautter said. Nova Southeastern University law professor Bob Jarvis said that Singhal’s injunction was issued to prevent future violations. "That’s what injunctions typically do – they prevent further law-breaking," he said. Other times in court, Snipes prevailed. In 2016, a Broward judge found no harm done to a handful of voters who initially received absentee ballots that omitted an amendment to legalize medical marijuana. Snipes offered replacement ballots to those voters. In April, a federal judge sided with Snipes in a lawsuit brought by the American Civil Rights Union, a conservative group. The judge concluded that Snipes made reasonable efforts to purge ineligible voters from the rolls. Some other Broward elections problems didn’t result in litigation, such as when the county election website posted results about 30 minutes before the polls closed in the 2016 primary. VR Systems, a contractor for the elections supervisor, took responsibility. Broward prosecutors declined to file charges, finding essentially that it was a mistake. Snipes did not respond to a request for comment. Our ruling Rubio said the Broward elections department "has a history of violating the law." Rubio’s tweet linked to a lawsuit in which a judge found Snipes prematurely unlawfully destroyed ballots. In the other case Rubio cited, the judge issued an injunction preventing Snipes from opening mail-in ballots before the canvassing board convened. It is worth mentioning, though, that Snipes has also won two cases in which she was sued: one related to a handful of ballots that omitted an amendment question and another which pertained to removing ineligible voters.

pomt-02568	Virginia is "the No. 1 recipient of federal dollars."	mostly false	/virginia/statements/2014/jan/31/terry-mcauliffe/mcauliffe-says-virginia-receives-most-federal-mone/	The federal government has long been a gravy train for Virginia’s economy, but Gov. Terry McAuliffe is worried Washington is cutting the tracks. During his first address to the General Assembly in January, McAuliffe cited a list of natural attributes and state policies that have helped Virginia flourish. "Much of the success I just described results from Virginia being the number one recipient of federal dollars," he said. McAuliffe said federal defense cuts and a 16-day government shutdown last year "dealt a severe blow to our economy and our confidence in the future." He said Virginia must diversify and become less dependent on U.S. largesse. We wondered whether Virginia really is No. 1 on Uncle Sam’s spending list. Brian Coy, a McAuliffe spokesman pointed us to figures from the Center for Effective Government, a liberal non-profit group that tracks U.S. spending. They show that in fiscal 2011, companies located in Virginia had federal contracts totaling $88.7 billion -- tops in the nation. California companies were second with $62.4 billion in contracts followed by Texas, with $45.2 billion. Data published by USA Spending.gov, a web site established by the Office of Management and Budget in the White House, shows Virginia has been tops in federal contract receipts during each of the last four fiscal years. A large reason is that Virginia -- home to world’s largest Naval base in Norfolk and the nation’s largest shipbuilder in Newport News -- receives more federal defense dollars than any other state, according to a 2011 analysis by Bloomberg Government. But contracts are only part of federal spending. Washington sends states grants, direct payments for programs and pays salaries to federal employees scattered across the nation. To fully assess McAuliffe’s claim that Virginia is "the No. 1 recipient of federal dollars," we needed data that computed all of the federal dollars disbursed in Virginia. The U.S. Census Bureau used to tally the total amount of federal money flowing into each state in its Consolidated Federal Funds Report. Results from the final study showed that in fiscal 2010, Virginia ranked sixth among states in receiving federal largesse. Here’s a list of the leaders: California, $333.8 billion Texas, $225.7 billion New York, $202.3 billion Florida, $186.7 billion Pennsylvania, $145.9 billion Virginia, $136.1 billion. Our ruling McAuliffe, in his maiden address to the General Assembly, said Virginia is "the No. 1 recipient of federal dollars." The governor’s office backs the statement by citing statistics showing Virginia is tops in receiving federal contracts. But McAuliffe, in his speech, never defined his terms and federal dollars come to states in many ways, including salaries, grants and payments for Social Security, Medicaid and Medicare. When it’s all put together, the most current data ranks Virginia sixth in receipt of federal funds and second when the largesse is broken down to an average per citizen. We don’t dispute McAuliffe’s gist that Virginia’s economy heavily relies on federal spending, but he illustrated his point with inartfully. Virginia leads the nation in receiving a few types of payments from Washington. Overall, Virginia is near the top of the list, but it’s not No. 1. So we rate McAuliffe’s statement Mostly False.

pomt-03139	Says he "opposed the president’s decision to go into Iraq" in 2003.	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2013/sep/13/john-kerry/secretary-state-john-kerry-says-senator-he-opposed/	Secretary of State John Kerry’s recent comment on MSNBC that in 2003 he "opposed the president’s decision to go into Iraq" has summoned old battles from his 2004 presidential campaign. Even then, political opponents accused him of trying to have it both ways on the war — voting in October 2002 to give President George W. Bush authorization to use force, then criticizing the March 2003 invasion from its beginning as a "failure of diplomacy." MSNBC host Chris Hayes suggested in a Sept. 5 interview that the United States might be committing itself to escalating involvement in Syria if it decided to strike and then Bashar Assad used chemical weapons again. Kerry responded, "I disagree. And, first of all, let me make this clear. The president — and this is very important, because I think a lot of Americans, all of your listeners, a lot of people in the country are sitting there and saying oh, my gosh, this is going to be Iraq, this is going to be Afghanistan. Here we go again. "I know this. I’ve heard it. And the answer is no, profoundly no. You know, Sen. Chuck Hagel, when he was senator, Sen. Chuck Hagel, now secretary of defense, and when I was a senator, we opposed the president’s decision to go into Iraq, but we know full well how that evidence was used to persuade all of us that authority ought to be given." Both Kerry and Hagel voted to authorize the use of force in Iraq. So what was Kerry talking about when he said he "opposed the president’s decision"? We’ll start on Oct. 9, 2002, the day Kerry spoke on the Senate floor in support of authorizing Bush to use force in Iraq. He urged the president to work through the United Nations Security Council and said that if Bush walked away from that effort, he would "vigorously oppose the president doing so." He explained his expectation that the president would consider war "the last option to address this threat, not the first," saying: "In giving the president this authority, I expect him to fulfill the commitments he has made to the American people in recent days — to work with the United Nations Security Council to adopt a new resolution setting out tough and immediate inspection requirements, and to act with our allies at our side if we have to disarm Saddam Hussein by force. If he fails to do so, I will be among the first to speak out." In March 2003, with an invasion imminent, Kerry accused the president of failing to work effectively with American allies, as he had urged in October. The Boston Globe reported March 19 that Kerry blamed "a failure of diplomacy of a massive order" by the Bush administration. "It's the way they have conducted the diplomacy that has compounded this problem, split the U.N., split the NATO, left the world wondering with questions, engaged in a more pre-emptive effort than was necessary," Kerry said. "We could have moved from a position of strength, in my judgment, and I think it represents a failure of diplomacy of a massive order, and that is what war is: War is the failure of diplomacy." The Boston Herald quoted him the same day saying, "President Bush has clumsily and arrogantly squandered the post-9-11 support and goodwill of the entire civilized world in a manner that will make the jobs ahead of us — both the military defeat (of Saddam) and the rebuilding of Iraq — decidedly more expensive in every sense of the word." Another Herald story March 19 noted the senator said "he won't back off his criticism of Bush's handling of the war, despite the fact that troops probably will be in battle this week." Strategists for Democratic presidential rival Howard Dean accused Kerry of "trying to duck responsibility for his war authorization vote," the Herald reported. Kerry defended himself a few days later, saying after a speech that his position on Iraq "has never varied," the Herald reported March 24. The Kerry-Dean sniping continued. On March 29, a Herald headline blared, "Dean blasts Dem rival Kerry for 'wobbly' war stance." "To this day I don't know what John Kerry's position is," Dean said in Iowa, the Herald reported. "If you agree with the war, then say so. If you don't agree with the war, then say so. But don't try to wobble around in between." ABC News host George Stephanopoulos highlighted the dispute with his very first question at the Democratic presidential debate on May 3, 2003: "Sen. Kerry, the first question goes to you. On March 19, President Bush ordered Gen.Tommy Franks to execute the invasion of Iraq. Was that the right decision at the right time?" Kerry said, "George, I said at the time I would have preferred if we had given diplomacy a greater opportunity, but I think it was the right decision to disarm Saddam Hussein. And when the president made the decision, I supported him, and I support the fact that we did disarm him." In March 2004, the Washington Post noted that "Kerry ended up voting for the 2002 resolution, but warned he would not support the war if Bush failed to win the support of the international community in the absence of an imminent threat. The argument has allowed Kerry to suggest he favored the war at the time of the vote — but also later become a critic of Bush's handling of the conflict." In August 2004, the Post published a story headlined, "In Hindsight, Kerry Says He'd Still Vote for War," which quoted him saying, "I would have voted for the authority. I believe it was the right authority for a president to have." Our ruling Kerry said recently that he "opposed the president’s decision to go into Iraq." In 2002, he voted to give the president the authority to attack, with a stern warning that Bush ought to exhaust diplomatic channels first. In 2003, as the president invaded, Kerry accused him of a "failure of diplomacy." As a Democratic presidential primary unfolded in which the war was unpopular, Kerry kept up his criticism of Bush’s handling of the war. But he still said at a 2003 debate that he thought it was "the right decision" to disarm Hussein and that "when the president made that decision, I supported him." In 2004, he said he would vote to authorize force all over again. It’s clear Kerry opposed the president’s handling of the war, and perhaps the president’s decision to "go into Iraq" militarily at the time he did. He suggested diplomatic opportunities were squandered. But he did vote to authorize force, and he said later he supported the president’s decision to disarm Hussein. It was a nuanced position — one too nuanced to be summarized accurately by a claim as blunt as having "opposed the president’s decision to go into Iraq." These are critical facts that would give a different impression. We rate Kerry’s claim Mostly False.	None	John Kerry	None	None	None	2013-09-13T14:06:11	2013-09-05	['Iraq']
pomt-14242	In every ethics case that has resulted in a formal sanction, "there's been an investigative subcommittee that's been established first."	half-true	/florida/statements/2016/apr/13/alan-grayson/us-rep-alan-grayson-downplays-potential-punishment/	U.S. Rep. Alan Grayson waved off a recent congressional report on his alleged ethics violations, arguing that the findings mean he’s practically in the clear. The Office of Congressional Ethics on April 5, 2016, released a report recommending that a House committee keep investigating Grayson. The Orlando Democrat, who is running for Sen. Marco Rubio’s soon-to-open seat, has been accused of improperly managing a hedge fund, not disclosing all his finances and conducting business deals with the federal government that would be conflicts of interest. So far, the House has not formed a new subcommittee to keep looking into the allegations. Grayson said in a conference call with reporters that is a sign he likely won’t have to face serious repercussions. "In every single instance where there's been any formal sanction -— an expulsion, a reprimand or a censure of any member — in every one of those cases since the Office of Congressional Ethics was established, there's been an investigative subcommittee that's been established first," he said. He added that if the House Ethics Committee doesn’t form one of these panels, it usually will dismiss the complaint. "What this does very likely represent is the end of the road regarding this particular inquiry," he said. We wondered whether Grayson was right that formal sanctions have only followed the creation of an investigative subcommittee. We found that Grayson has a point on the most severe types of punishments, but it doesn’t mean investigations (or potential penalties) have reached "the end of the road." There may yet be mileage to cover here. House rules Let’s look at how ethics investigations work. The Office of Congressional Ethics is an independent body in charge of reviewing misconduct charges by House members and their staffs. The House created the office in March 2008 after criticism that its own self-policing wasn’t working very well, and the new office began reviewing cases in February 2009. The office investigates complaints, then makes recommendations to the House Ethics Committee. The committee can act upon the office’s reports, and still has the power to start investigations on its own. Grayson cited as "formal sanctions" — expulsion, reprimand and censure — but those are punishments that Congress rarely metes out, to begin with. Expulsion is what it sounds like: A member is removed from the House by a two-thirds vote. It has only happened five times in the history of the chamber, all before the Office of Congressional Ethics was created. The last time was in 2002, when Rep. James Traficant, D-Ohio, was expelled after taking campaign funds for personal use. Pennsylvania Democrat Michael Myers was expelled in 1980 for accepting a $50,000 bribe during the FBI’s Abscam sting, and three other members were kicked out after the Civil War started, for disloyalty to the Union. Next is censure, when a majority of the House votes to admonish a member’s behavior. Usually this includes a public shaming of sorts, during which the censured member must stand in the middle of the House chamber while a resolution is read aloud. The most recent example is Rep. Charlie Rangel, D-N.Y., who was censured in 2010 for 11 ethics violations. Those violations included misusing his office resources to solicit funds and not paying taxes on a vacation home. It was the 23rd time a member had been punished with a censure. Rangel’s censure did have an investigative subcommittee in the House Ethics Committee, because procedure in this case required it. The same is true for the formal reprimand, also decided by House vote following an investigation. According to a 2013 Congressional Research Service report, "reprimand" and "censure" were essentially interchangeable until "reprimand" was defined as a lesser punishment in 1976. Unlike a censure, there is no public humiliation component of a reprimand. In 2012, California Democrat Laura Richardson was reprimanded for making congressional staff work on her campaign. Her punishment included a $10,000 fine. It was the 10th formal reprimand since 1976. We’ll note the Office of Congressional Ethics doesn’t factor in here, because the House Ethics Committee started its own investigation into Richardson, without a referral from the office. Again, the committee did empanel an investigative subcommittee, because that’s the procedure. Craig Holman, a lobbyist with government watchdog Public Citizen, said Grayson "is painting a false picture" of how members of Congress are disciplined. The formal punishments outlined above require an investigative subcommittee, but House rules outline scads of other punishments that can be levied. These other actions include fines, restitution, amending errant financial reports, removal from committees, loss of privileges or seniority or "any other sanction determined by the Committee to be appropriate." Holman said there’s been more than 20 of these cases since the OCE started. The House Ethics Committee is not necessarily bound to begin an investigative subcommittee in these cases. And even then, as sometimes happens in these cases, members can leave office rather than face an investigation (the committee only holds sway over House members). In 2011, Ohio Republican Jean Schmidt was ordered to repay $500,000 for free legal help without the House Ethics Committee starting an investigative subcommittee. She was not found guilty of knowingly violating House ethics rules. She repaid less than $50,000 before losing her re-election primary. There also isn’t always a set time limit for action, as Grayson implied. Instead of dismissing the complaint, the House Ethics Committee cited rule 18(a) in its conclusion to the OCE report on his case. That means the committee will keep the case open and may start an investigative subcommittee later. Sometimes that can mean much later. For example, the committee invoked rule 18(a) in August 2012 for Rep. Rob Andrews, D-N.J. An investigative subcommittee didn’t come until six months later, in March 2013. Andrews resigned the following year, with the investigation still open. We also found one other exceptional case that’s important to note. South Carolina Republican Joe Wilson was formally reprimanded in 2009 for interrupting President Barack Obama’s State of the Union address by shouting, "You lie!" That was through a resolution, not an ethics investigation. Wilson refused to formally apologize on the House floor after already apologizing to Obama personally. The Democrat-led House voted 240-179 for the reprimand over his "breach of decorum." The vote was largely seen as a political maneuver, not an outright ethics violation. Our ruling Grayson said that in every ethics case that has resulted in a formal sanction, "there's been an investigative subcommittee that's been established first." The formal sanctions he cited were expulsion, censure and reprimand, all of which are exceedingly rare punishments. There are only three examples to pick from since the Office of Congressional Ethics materialized in 2009. In one case — the case of Wilson yelling "you lie!" — a formal reprimand came via a largely party-line resolution, not an ethics investigation, so no subcommittee was established. More importantly, Grayson omits that there are many other ways to discipline a member of Congress beyond formal sanctions. He also downplays that the House Ethics Committee kept his case open and could convene an investigative committee later. We rate his statement Half True.

Facebook users tagged the story as being potentially fabricated, as part of the social network’s efforts to fight fake news. The article said Hart, 38, lost control of his car in Summerlin, Nev., on Monday night, corresponding to the first time we saw the post on Sept. 18, 2017. Summerlin is a planned community west of Las Vegas. The post said Hart had been exceeding the 25 mph speed limit and went off the road, hitting a guardrail. Hart was allegedly taken to MountainView Hospital, a real hospital in Summerlin, and remained in critical condition. This accident never happened, mind you, because the post is fake. The photo the website used was of a 2010 accident in Montana, in which a college student had fallen asleep and hit a guardrail that speared his car but missed the driver by inches. There have been no reports that Hart was in any car accident, let alone was injured. He has been posting on social media accounts since then, which the fake post actually used in its writeup of the bogus crash. The second half of the NYDailyNews-TV.com post went on about how Hart had confessed online the day prior about how he had made a "bad error in judgment" that had affected his family and made him a target of extortion. Hart had posted an Instagram video on Sept. 16 with the caption, "Sending so many apologies to my wife & kids. I gotta do better and I will. I'm not perfect and have never claimed to be ...I love you all." See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com Gossipy outlets reported that the extortion involved a "sexually suggestive" video of Hart and another woman. NYDailyNews-TV.com, meanwhile, is not a website for a TV news station or any other legitimate media outlet. It’s another fake news site, without any contact information, posing as a real news source, like others we’ve encountered. While it tries to capitalize on the name recognition of the tabloid New York Daily News, that real newspaper’s website is actually NYDailyNews.com. The story evoked a real celebrity scandal to bolster a completely fake car accident to draw traffic to a website masquerading as a well-known newspaper. We rate this claim Pants On Fire!

pomt-09312	Florida teachers are "already paid $5,000 below the national average."	mostly true	/florida/statements/2010/apr/19/dan-gelber/gelber-says-florida-teacher-salaries-5000-lower-na/	In the heated debate over the teacher pay bill that Gov. Charlie Crist vetoed, opponents of the bill often said that Florida teachers were underpaid. They warned that the bill -- which would have linked teacher pay increases to student performance -- would only make matters worse. Dan Gelber, a Democratic candidate for Florida attorney general and an opponent of the bill, wrote in a letter to Crist posted on his campaign blog that, "the problem with the bill is it assumes the best way to weed out bad teachers is to assume all teachers are bad. While other states are addressing teaching tenure by simply modifying the number of years it takes to obtain tenure, Florida would take the drastic step of eliminating tenure and forcing teachers to work on year-to-year contracts. For a profession that, in our state, is already paid $5,000 below the national average, this will be demoralizing in the extreme." We have no illusions that teachers enter the profession in hopes of becoming millionaires, but is the problem really as acute as Gelber makes it out to be? We contacted Gelber's campaign to ask about the source of his claim. A spokesman sent us a copy of the 2008 teacher compensation survey from the National Education Association, a teachers union. The report shows that in the 2007-2008 school year, the average teacher salary in Florida was slightly more than $5,000 below the national average. But we discovered the 2008-2009 numbers that Gelber's campaign provided are estimates that are now outdated. The most recent report shows that the actual national average in the 2008-2009 school year was $54,319, compared with $46,921 in Florida. That's a difference of more than $7,000. So Gelber could have used newer numbers that would better bolster his point that Florida teachers are underpaid. Besides the NEA, we found two other widely recognized data sets on teacher salaries. These come from the American Federation of Teachers, another teachers union, and the National Center for Education Statistics, a federal agency. AFT's data is for the 2006-2007 school year. The average teacher salary was $51,009 in the U.S., and $47,219 in Florida, a difference of about $3,800. The federal agency's data only looked at seven states, so it doesn't provide a full national picture for comparison. We should note some caveats about making state comparisons of teacher salaries. The Florida Department of Education notes that surveys may not account for cost-of-living differences and factors such as states with higher percentages of teachers with masters' degreees. We also spoke with Elena Silva, a senior policy analyst at Education Sector, an independent education policy think tank. Silva told us that "more important than comparing salaries to national average is considering total compensation (such as benefits and pensions) and cost of living." Unfortunately this data is hard to come by, which makes meaningful comparisons difficult. Still, Gelber said "paid," which to most people means just salary and there's enough for us to assess his claim that Florida teachers are paid $5,000 below the national average. The most recent data from the National Education Association, the source he cited, show that his estimate was actually on the low side and that the disparity is greater that he claimed. But a survey from the American Federation of Teachers suggests the difference isn't as great as he claimed. Still, both surveys support his underlying point that Florida teachers lag behind the national average. So we find his claim Mostly True.

pomt-03424	U.S. Rep. Phil Gingrey wants public schools to teach women to "stay in their place."	pants on fire!	/georgia/statements/2013/jun/26/lauren-benedict/fundraising-email-puts-words-gingreys-mouth/	Before the U.S. Supreme Court decides the fate of the Defense of Marriage Act, U.S. House members made their case for upholding the law during a round of floor speeches last week. During his roughly five-minute speech, Marietta Republican Phil Gingrey affirmed his support for traditional marriage, suggested some value-teaching methods for young people, and outraged some of his critics all at the same time. Georgia’s WIN List, a political action committee that helps recruit and train Democratic women for political office, sent out an email the day after Gingrey’s comments. The email message was sent as part of a fundraising plea and signed by the PAC’s chairwoman, Lauren Benedict. "Rep. Phil Gingrey is promoting the teaching of gender stereotypes in elementary schools. He wants public schools to teach women to ‘stay in their place,’ " the email said. "Your gift of $50, $100, or $250 will help us show these men that a woman’s ‘place’ is in the House and in the Senate!" the message ends. "Stay in their place" and "place" were in single quotes in the email. Gingrey, one of four major Republican candidates running in Georgia for the Senate, has already made a name for himself in the questionable statements category. Earlier this year, he said Senate candidate Todd Akin of Missouri was "partly right" that a woman’s body has a way of shutting down if she’s raped to prevent pregnancy. We wondered whether Gingrey had again made controversial statements about women. Did he really say schools should teach them to "stay in their place?" We decided to take a closer look. A day after Benedict’s PAC sent out its anti-Gingrey email, Better Georgia -- a left-leaning political group -- sent out its own email/fundraising message opposing conservative Georgia congressmen. That group said that the men, including Gingrey, want to be sure that women "know their place." But what exactly did Gingrey say? A review of the tape shows that Gingrey spends part of his time talking about Father’s Day and his own family. He admits that the old family model that was illustrated in television classics like "Father Knows Best" are outdated, but he holds firm to his belief that families need a mother and a father to work well. "You know, maybe part of the problem is we need to go back into the schools ... and have a class for the young girls and have a class for the young boys and say ... what’s important," Gingrey said. "This is what a father does that is maybe a little different, maybe a little bit better than the talents that a mom has in a certain area. And the same thing for the young girls, that ... this is what a mom does, and this is what is important from the standpoint of that union which we call marriage." Record of his comments quickly made headlines and were picked up by several news outlets, including Fox News and the Huffington Post. PolitiFact Georgia reviewed a video of Gingrey’s remarks several times. And we found that he never used the phrase about women that they should "stay in their place" or "know their place." We asked Benedict about the PAC’s claim. In an email to us, Benedict -- who is also a member of the Macon City Council -- said the use of single quotes around the phrase was for emphasis and not intended to be a direct quote of Gingrey’s comments. She says Gingrey’s recommendation for the gender classes presents a 1950s view of marriage. "What else, other than the desire for women to stay in their place, can be inferred from these statements and Gingrey’s desire to have separate classes to teach traditional gender roles," Benedict wrote. Gingrey’s spokeswoman, Jen Talaber, provided us with a statement similar to what was provided to another Atlanta Journal-Constitution reporter last week. She did not address specific questions about the criticism and it being used in fundraiser statements. "Phil is a strong supporter of traditional marriage and believes strong male and female role models are essential in a child’s development. Phil was speaking theoretically to emphasize his point that kids learn different things from their mothers and fathers," the statement said. Political parties send out this type of "red meat" rhetoric to solicit funds and energize their party base, their most loyal voters, said Kerwin Swint, a political science professor at Kennesaw State University. "Both parties will try and make the other look as extreme as possible," he said. "In this case, they are making the case for extremism against women." So, does the Democratic PAC’s claim measure up? In an email, a leader at Georgia’s WIN List said that Gingrey wanted public schools to teach women to "stay in their place." The group said that the phrase "to stay in their place" was for emphasis and not a direct quote from Gingrey. Video of the congressman’s comments show that he did not use this phrase. Gingrey did make statements about gender roles that some critics found offensive. But Benedict quotes Gingrey as mouthing specific words that he did not utter. We rate her statement Pants On Fire.

pomt-10774	"Senator Clinton tried to spend $1 million on the Woodstock Concert Museum."	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2007/oct/19/john-mccain/yes-clinton-played-lead-for-woodstock-museum/	The full quote from a debate in Orlando, Fla. on Oct. 21, 2007. : "In case you missed it, a few days ago, Senator Clinton tried to spend $1 million on the Woodstock Concert Museum. Now, my friends, I wasn't there. I'm sure it was a cultural and pharmaceutical event...I was tied up at the time." McCain's claim is accurate. The Senate Labor, Health and Human Services and Education Committee Appropriations Report shows that Clinton and fellow New York Sen. Charles Schumer did lobby for a $1 million earmark for the Bethel Performing Arts Center in Liberty N.Y. Clinton and Schumer intended to use the earmark for a museum located at the Performing Arts Center that would commemorate the 1969 Woodstock music festival in their state. The Woodstock museum -- officially called the Museum at Bethel Woods -- is due to open in the spring of 2008, but without the federal money. According to a statement on Clinton's website, the $1 million in federal funds was to be used for purchasing and borrowing exhibits at the non-profit museum as well as the audio-visual presentations, computer interactive displays and films. The senator's website says the exhibits will focus on the "post-WWII period and cultural, political, social, and significant historic events during this period including, in particular, the period of the 1960's and its continuing legacy." When Clinton announced the $1 million earmark for the museum on June 22, 2007, she said: "These funds will help the for the Bethel Woods Center for the Arts continue to promote education, the arts, culture and tourism in the region." The New York senators were successful at including the money when the bill passed the Appropriations Committee. But the full Senate then approved an amendment introduced by Tom Coburn, R-Okla., that stripped the money for the Bethel museum and instead redirected it to the Health Resources and Services Administration for the maternal and child health services program. During Senate debate, Clinton did not defend the Woodstock project, but Schumer strongly stood up for the Bethel project as an asset for an economically struggling county. UPDATE: McCain's campaign used his remark for a TV ad that began airing in New Hampshire a few days later. The ad begins with psychedelic music (the Doors?) and a swirl of colors to invoke memories of Woodstock. It then shows McCain's statement from the debate interspersed with a shot of him in a North Vietnamese prison when he says he was "tied up at the time."

pomt-13849	"There are approximately 18,000 (police) departments in the United States."	mostly true	/punditfact/statements/2016/jul/10/charles-ramsey/how-many-police-departments-are-us/	Is there a link between police killing people during routine patrols and the sheer number of police departments in the country? Former Philadelphia Police Commissioner Charles Ramsey argued that there is. A traffic stop for a broken taillight in Falcon Heights, Minn., left Philando Castile dead. Falcon Heights only has about 5,500 residents and contracts its police service from the not much larger city of St. Anthony, population about 8,500. Ramsey, co-chair of a recent presidential policing task force, teased out the connections between law enforcement and race with Meet the Press host Chuck Todd on July 10, 2016. Todd said major urban police departments have been taking steps to ease racial tensions and asked Ramsey if the smaller departments had the same kind of resources. Ramsey painted a picture that went well beyond core funding. "There are approximately 18,000 departments in the United States," Ramsey said. "I would try to cut the number in half in the next 10 years or so, because you're always going to have these kinds of issues as long as you have this many departments with different policies, procedures, training and the like." The numbers back Ramsey up on the number of departments. The final report from the task force he led said there are 17,985 U.S. police agencies. But that includes everything from college campus patrols, to sheriffs, to local police, to federal agents. For strictly local law enforcement, police and sheriff departments with armed officers, the total is closer to 15,400, according to the latest report from the Bureau of Justice Statistics. Those are the kinds of departments involved in some of the more prominent deadly encounters with police in the past few years. Still, 15,400 is a big number, and half of those departments have fewer than 10 officers. These smaller units face some real challenges. David Weisburd, executive director of the Center for Evidence-based Crime Policy at George Mason University, said while some do fine work, the quality ranges widely. "There is little consistency in training or procedures across them," Weisburd said. "There are many departments that simply poorly train and lead their officers." Turnover is a common complaint. The police chief in Canon City, Colo., wrote in a 2013 article that the combination of rising suburban crime and limited budgets meant "agency personnel are stretched in many cases beyond the breaking point, making retention of quality personnel increasingly challenging." The biggest urban agencies demand more education for their officers. About 30 percent of the very largest departments require at least a two-year college degree. In the smallest communities, only 10 percent do. The shooting death of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Mo., produced a scathing report on the dangers that come when each small town boasts its own police department. Community leaders invited the Police Executive Research Forum, a leading national policy group, to take a look at the issues with the policing system across the wider St. Louis area. The report said fragmentation led to unprofessionalism and widespread mistrust of the police. About a third of the departments served territories of less than one square mile. Inefficiency was rife, and "just one-quarter of the police departments in St. Louis City and County are accredited by the Commission on Accreditation for Law Enforcement Agencies." The task force Ramsey co-chaired highlighted the testimony of criminologist Lawrence Sherman, who said "so many problems of organizational quality control are made worse by the tiny size of most local police agencies." Our ruling Ramsey said that the country has about 18,000 departments that conduct some sort of policing. In the broadest sense, that is accurate. If you include every college campus security department, tribal land unit, sheriff office, local police department, state police, and every federal agency, you get to 17,985. In terms of the most common local law enforcement agencies, that is sheriff and local police departments, the number is about 15,400. These are the ones where the issue of deadly encounters between police and citizens is front and center. Ramsey was making the case that when it comes to policing, small often is not beautiful, and plenty of evidence backs that up. But for the problem facing the country, the smaller number is most applicable. We rate his statement Mostly True. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/04e30a17-b5ca-460d-a7d5-2d973bc58c35	None	Charles Ramsey	None	None	None	2016-07-10T18:26:14	2016-07-10	['United_States']
pomt-06945	"I've created over 40,000 jobs."	mostly false	/florida/statements/2011/jul/19/craig-miller/former-ruths-chris-ceo-craig-miller-says-he-create/	Usually when politicians claim that they created jobs, they are talking about jobs created by the private sector while they held public office. And we're skeptical. But when that politician is a former Ruth's Chris Steak House chief executive running on his business credentials, well, we're curious. If a CEO can't take credit for job creation, who can? Craig Miller, a Republican who jumped into politics with a 2010 primary run for an Orlando-area congressional seat (he finished third), announced in July 2011 that he would run for the U.S. Senate. That made him a relative newcomer facing Florida Senate President Mike Haridopolos, former U.S. Sen. George LeMieux, former state House Majority Leader Adam Hasner and former U.S. Army Col. Mike McCalister. (Haridopolos thinned the field by dropping out less than a week later.) Miller, 61, explained his decision to "take on the career politicians" in a four-paragraph essay on his website. Here's the third paragraph: "Those that have had a chance to lead have failed us. The politicians we have trusted to represent us are the ones who have gotten us into the mess we now face. The time for new leadership is now. I'm a businessman. I've been fortunate enough to live the American Dream, starting in the dish room and working my way up to the board room. Along the way, I've created over 40,000 jobs and I've spent my career in the restaurant industry balancing budgets and meeting payroll. I know the kind of pro-growth and pro-job environment we need to get our economy moving again. My life experiences have prepared me to go to Washington and take on the career politicians and entrenched interests that only know how to spend your money." We saw the same number in a campaign news release a day later and wondered: Did Craig Miller, restaurant executive, create 40,000 jobs? Here's how Miller told us he did the math. He explained that he started his executive career with the company that owned Red Lobster in 1973, back when the restaurant chain was only in the Southeast. (The company was called General Mills Restaurants, before General Mills spun it off as the behemoth Darden Restaurants in 1995. Heard of Olive Garden? LongHorn Steakhouse? Yeah, them.) Red Lobster's extraordinary growth — hundreds of new restaurants while Miller was there — meant lots of new jobs. In 1984 Miller joined Uno Restaurant Corp., helping transform pizza joint Pizzeria Uno into Uno Chicago Grill, where he landed his first CEO gig in 1996. By the time he left in 2001, Uno Chicago Grill had grown by more than 180 restaurants, creating yet more jobs. After a quick stint at already troubled Furr's Restaurant Group, he took on a higher-profile role at what became Ruth's Hospitality Group, where he was chief executive from 2004 to 2008. Before he left, he said, the high-end Ruth's Chris had added about 30 steak houses. So, to him, the math is simple: More than 700 new restaurants opened during his career, multiplied by an average number of about 60 new employees per restaurant, for more than 40,000 jobs. (For his specific estimates, see box.) Miller said his job claim did not include a National Restaurant Association stat-booster that says every restaurant job supports almost a full position elsewhere in the economy, which he figured would have put his job creation total "somewhere north of 80,000 or 90,000." "I tried to be conservative, because I come from a financial analysis background," he said. "I wanted to make sure we don't overstate what I've done." With Miller's calculus in hand, we started our own search, chatting with folks and digging through old news clips and earnings releases to piece together the numbers — and Miller's role in them. We'll accept the average-employees-per-restaurant figure of 62.5 that Miller used in making his claim — after checking with experts and industry data. And his estimates for the numbers of restaurants that popped up during his tenure at a handful of companies, while not exact, were generally close when we spot-checked them against business stories and earnings reports from the time. As for his role: Certainly, the guy has a reputation as a growth machine. Chris Muller, the dean of hospitality administration at Boston University, was an expert in chain restaurants at University of Central Florida when he met Miller. He named Miller UCF's restaurateur of the year in 2000 and featured him at a European food service conference. He also invested in Ruth's Chris when Miller took it public in 2005. He described Miller's approach as "very aggressive" as the head of Uno, which grew from just 10 to 15 restaurants when he joined as a vice president to nearly 200 when he left as CEO, and said he was similarly expansion-focused at Ruth's Chris, where he took the company public, creating additional pressure for growth. "So he does have a history of creating positions for people," Muller said. Of course, that growth also meant Ruth's Chris was stretched thin as the economy started to flail, and its stock price dove. The board asked Miller to leave in 2008. Miller's expansionist style had its "positives and negatives," Muller said, but you couldn't deny he was a "growth-oriented CEO." But what about his role before he was a head honcho? Miller's campaign manager pointed us to Bill Bridges, who worked with Miller for most of the 1970s, starting at General Mills as director of personnel the year before Miller came on board. He recalls a bright, hard-working guy who analyzed sites for expansion and made presentations to the executive committee about where to build. "From that perspective, he was integral to the growth of the company," he said. Miller's own two-page biography says he held positions at General Mills in finance, planning and analysis, development, real estate, corporate growth and purchasing. But he was there for over a decade. We had to know: Did he jump in with both feet, spawning Red Lobsters from his first months at General Mills in his early 20s? And that's when part of the story got off track. In 1996, when Miller was named CEO of Uno Restaurant Corp., the Boston Business Journal wrote a profile. It told of Miller's journey from high-school dishwasher to Vietnam Air Force veteran to accounting major at Florida State University. Then it described his start with General Mills in Tallahassee, after he wrote the company a letter asking about positions at Red Lobster. He didn't yet have his business degree, but "in 1973 became a part-time auditor of the local restaurant." Later, the article says, he was asked to audit the books of another Red Lobster in Central Florida. He finished his degree at University of Central Florida in 1974, it says, and started working in payroll. Eventually he became vice president of finance. Which means Miller claims to have created jobs at restaurants that sprang up as he was a 20-something part-time auditor and then a payroll employee. It's not clear how long it took for him to reach management. The claim gets even murkier when you look closely at his own bio. General Mills Restaurants' success was led by the blockbuster growth of Red Lobster, which by 1983 — just 15 years after the first restaurant opened — had 350 locations in 36 states and had started to reach into Japan, according to New York Times article at the time. But while Craig Miller's General Mills career started with paper-pushing, the last part focused on a chain with a far less impressive legacy than Red Lobster. As a finance guy, Miller had helped General Mills put together the acquisition of small Mexican food chain Casa Gallardo, according to the Boston Business Journal. His biography notes that after that deal in 1979, his "primary duties" were as vice president of the Mexican chain. Starting with just a handful of restaurants — one, according to his bio, or five, according to the Business Journal — Miller and Ramon Gallardo took the Casa Gallardo chain to 34. The goal, said an article at the time, had been 100. Not long after Miller had moved on to Pizzeria Uno, General Mills dumped the chain, which by then numbered just 25. It had been profitable for General Mills, just not profitable enough. "We didn't get it all put together with the speed that enabled us to capitalize," company spokesman Dean Belbas told Minneapolis-St. Paul City Business shortly after the sale. Why does any of this matter? Well, in Miller's back-of-the-napkin math, new Red Lobsters made up nearly half the jobs he claimed credit for. But those include new Red Lobsters while he was a part-time auditor. New Red Lobsters while he worked in payroll. New Red Lobsters while he worked in finance. New Red Lobsters as he built Casa Gallardo. His campaign's response? "He was the top financial and economic adviser to the CEO and was directly involved in all aspects of the company's business, even while serving as vice president of Casa Gallardo," campaign manager Paul Ciaramitaro said. "Craig had a vital hand in the company expansion and job creation at General Mills during the 1970s and into the 1980s." But was Miller ultimately responsible? More so than Red Lobster's founder, Bill Darden, or the man who followed in his footsteps, former Darden Restaurants chairman and CEO Joe Lee? Joe Lee did tell the Boston Business Journal in 1996 he considered Miller "one of the industry's top leaders." (We attempted to reach him at home, unsuccessfully.) But we would dare to speculate he wouldn't credit Miller with every job at every restaurant General Mills added from 1973 to 1984. Where does this leave us? Several folks told us that Miller's a respected restaurateur. Like Herman Cain, a former president and CEO of the National Restaurant Association, he served in leadership there as chairman of the board. Companies grew dramatically under his corporate leadership. But to reach 40,000 jobs created, Miller takes credit for thousands of jobs he wasn't in a position to create. Growth at Red Lobster, early in his career, accounts for 46 percent of his estimate — and it's a stretch to credit him for even half of that. He also counts job gains only and not losses — something any politician relying on net job creation numbers can't do. And we can't know how many jobs he actually added to communities — for every Casa Gallardo, a local mom-and-pop may have closed or had layoffs — though in strong economies, every job may have indeed added to the overall total. Make no mistake, our reporting shows Miller was a gung ho restaurant CEO who stressed expansion and by extension, job creation. A lower jobs number may have rated higher on the Truth-O-Meter. But 40,000 jobs? He just hasn't proved it. We rate this claim Barely True. Jobs math Here's how Craig Miller breaks down his career job creation, with Red Lobster representing nearly half of the total: Ruth's Hospitality Group (2004-08) Miller's role: Joined as president and CEO; from Sept. 2006, also chairman of the board Restaurants added by company during tenure: 37 Estimated jobs created: 2,313 Uno Restaurant Corp. (1984-2001) Miller's role: Joined as vice president for administration responsible for development and franchising, became executive vice president/chief operating officer, then in 1996 president and chief executive officer Restaurants added by company during tenure: About 185 Estimated jobs created: 11,563 General Mills Restaurants (1973-84) Miller's role: Joined as part-time auditor before earning college degree; moved to payroll; held positions in finance, planning and analysis, development, real estate, corporate growth and purchasing; after acquisition of Casa Gallardo in 1979, primary duties were as vice president of Casa Gallardo Restaurants added by company during tenure: Casa Gallardo, about 30; Red Lobster, about 325; other brands, about 125 Estimated jobs created: 30,000 Total: 43,876 Sources: Craig Miller campaign, Boston Business Journal Notes: Restaurants added don't include acquisitions. General Mills Restaurants became Darden Restaurants in 1995. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published.

pomt-01660	"Before I was state treasurer, my Rhode Island business helped create over 1,000 jobs."	true	/rhode-island/statements/2014/aug/21/gina-raimondo/gina-raimondo-says-her-former-company-helped-creat/	In her "Back To Work" campaign ad, General Treasurer Gina Raimondo, one of four Democrats running for governor, stated that her former venture capital firm, Point Judith Capital, helped create more than 1,000 jobs when she was partner. She made the same claim while campaigning for treasurer in the 2010 election. (Raimondo left the firm the day she took office; her investments there are held in a blind trust. The company has been relocated to Boston.) The ad shows Raimondo at Nabsys, a biomedical company in Providence. "Before I was State Treasurer, my Rhode Island business helped create over 1,000 jobs, including here at Nabsys, a biomedical company," Raimondo said. "As governor, I’ll use this as a model for how we create manufacturing jobs. I’ll bring colleges and industry together to develop new products in marine science, green technology, and medical devices, and to train our workers to fill those jobs … We need to get Rhode Islanders back to work." This week, Raimondo reiterated that claim in a new TV ad about how she helped bring back Narragansett Beer, originally brewed in Rhode Island until the brewery closed for good in 1983. ("I helped create over a thousand jobs, from high tech to making beer …") Before we get started, let’s be clear about one thing. Venture capital firms such as Point Judith are not in the business of creating jobs. Their mission is to make money for their investors -- and themselves. They do so by raising money from entities such as private investors and public pension funds, and then investing it in startup companies, hoping for a big return if those companies take off. If the companies succeed and grow, they add jobs. But that’s not the goal of the venture capitalists. To support her claim, Raimondo sent us a list of 21 companies that Point Judith Capital invested in and how many jobs those investments -- and the company’s efforts -- helped create during the time she was a partner. They add up to 1,063. The list was produced by Point Judith Capital in late 2010, in preparation for her run for treasurer. We also interviewed Raimondo. She described Point Judith Capital’s role as an early-stage investor. "Typically, you sit on the board of the company, provide a lot of hand-holding and strategic advice, you help recruit people, and get the bank loan. It’s hands-on. That’s why we say "helped create’" those jobs. "We had to have invested money in the company, which means we had an ownership stake in the company … In every case we either had a board seat and additionally were just very involved in building the business, writing the business plan, helping to get customers. Raimondo said, "In these cases, we invested millions of dollars." Initially she said that was "more than two million in each of those companies." On Wednesday, Raimondo campaign manager Eric Hyers said Raimondo had misspoke. The investments were all at least six figures; they ranged from roughly $400,000 to $2 million or more. Raimondo noted that many of the companies have expanded and added jobs since then. Next, we attempted to call all 21 companies. Many were from out of state. Some had been bought out, and we were unable to reach the principals who worked there when Point Judith Capital was involved. At least one appears to have since closed. Of the representatives of seven companies we reached, all essentially confirmed Raimondo’s claims, representing roughly 480 jobs. In one case, the job number appeared to fall slightly short; in another, a CEO gave Raimondo credit for more than the number of jobs she cited. We spoke with Mark Hellendrung, president of Narragansett Brewing Co. The company is based in Providence. Hellendrung said the beer is now brewed in Rochester, N.Y., Pawcatuck, Conn., Westport, Mass. Test batches have been brewed locally in Rhode Island. Raimondo claimed Point Judith helped create 10 jobs there, and invested more than $1 million. Hellendrung confirmed that Point Judith Capital helped launch the company (which put the famous Narragansett lager beer back on the shelves) with "slightly less than" $2 million venture capital nine years ago, and active involvement. "We’ve got over 10 full-time people, and routinely we’ve got over 20 part-time people that work promotions and events … It’s been a labor of love and a ton of fun and Gina was very helpful in that process," Hellendrung said. We spoke with Michael O’Neil Jr., founder and CEO of GetWellNetwork, a health care technology company headquartered in Maryland. Raimondo claimed Point Judith Capital helped create 121 jobs there. "She’s totally correct," O’Neil said. "Gina and I met just as the company was getting started. Her leadership helped us get off the ground and helped get hundreds of jobs." Those included software engineers and project managers; others were on the services side, O’Neil said. Donna Dooley, chief financial officer at MedOptions, said that the 185 jobs that Raimondo credits Point Judith Capital with helping to create "sounds accurate." Dooley joined MedOptions in 2011, the year after Raimondo left Point Judith Capital, "and by then it was about 250" employees, she said. MedOptions provides behavioral health services in southern New England and the Mid-Atlantic. "I know that Point Judith Capital and another investment company put money in … I do think it’s fair to say that there was a fair amount of job creation" at that time, Dooley said. Steven J. Tallarida, cofounder of the former Spirus Medical, said Raimondo "probably sold herself short" by listing nine as the number of jobs Point Judith Capital helped create at that medical device company. "It was probably around 20," Tallarida said in a phone interview. Those included research and development, manufacturing and sales jobs. Point Judith Capital invested "a couple of million." Raimondo sat on the board, "and she would give governance on how to do things," Tallarida said. (The Massachusetts-based company was sold in 2011 to the Tokyo-based Olympus Corp.) Genevieve Thiers, who cofounded Sittercity, wrote in an email that Point Judith Capital "put in $2.5 million and led our Series A round. Due to them and the other $2.5 million … we were able to grow from 20 employees to about 80." (Raimondo credited her former company with helping to create 80 jobs at Sittercity, a nationwide babysitter-matching website). Thiers added, "That money did not start the company but it was needed for a pivotal stage in growth." Thiers has since left the company but remains on the board. Dr. Barrett Bready, Nabsys cofounder and CEO, said in an email that Point Judith Capital "was the first venture capital firm to invest in the company, and the firm has continued to invest in subsequent financing rounds." Raimondo formerly held a board seat. Nabsys currently has 40 employees: the number Raimondo credits her former company with helping to create. Bob Lentz, founder of the former PermissionTV, in Waltham, Mass., wrote in an email that Point Judith Capital was actively involved." Raimondo said her firm helped create 40 jobs there. Lentz wrote, "It’s been a few years but the numbers sound right." (PermissionTV has been relaunched as VisibleGains). Our ruling: Gina Raimondo said her former firm, Point Judith Capital, helped create more than 1,000 jobs when she was a partner there. She produced a list of 21 companies and a precise number of jobs. We reached representatives of seven companies -- most of them cofounders and/or CEOs. They confirmed that Point Judith capital invested several million dollars - give or take - in each case; held board positions and as such, helped create jobs. The jobs numbers added to roughly 480 at those companies. While we were unable to reach all the companies Raimondo listed, the responses from the companies we did reach supported her qualified claim that Point Judith "helped create" 1,000 jobs. We rate Raimondo’s claim True. (If you have a claim you'd like us to check, email us at politifact@providencejournal.com. And follow us on Twitter: @politifactri.)

pomt-00249	"Some of the Democrats have been talking about ending (coverage for) pre-existing conditions."	pants on fire!	/truth-o-meter/statements/2018/oct/05/donald-trump/donald-trumps-pants-fire-claim-about-democrats-pre/	Democrats across the country have been saying on the campaign trail that the Republicans’ longstanding push to overturn the Affordable Care Act threatens insurance protections for Americans with pre-existing conditions. The law was passed in 2010 by a Democratic-controlled Congress and signed by President Barack Obama; no Republican voted for it. Republicans used popular dissatisfaction with the law to make significant congressional gains in the 2010 and 2014 midterm elections, but the pattern has shifted in 2018, after unsuccessful Republican efforts to repeal the law. The Wesleyan Media Project recently found that health care was the most common subject of Democratic congressional campaign ads, the New York Times reported. But in a rally in Rochester, Minn., on Oct. 4, President Donald Trump sought to flip this narrative on its head. He argued that it’s actually the Republicans who are the champions of pre-existing condition protections, and Democrats who are trying to kill them. "We will always protect Americans with pre-existing conditions," Trump said around the 34:00 mark. "We’re going to take care of them. Some of the Democrats have been talking about ending pre-existing conditions. And some people have -- you know what I say? We'll get a little more money from China. It'll be just fine. It'll be just fine. We'll be just fine." We have previously written that a pending lawsuit against the Affordable Care Act by Republican attorneys general would, if successful, end protections for pre-existing conditions. (Such protections could be reinstated by new legislation if the courts do strike down the law, but health policy experts say the mechanics of achieving this result in a way different from the Affordable Care Act would be tricky; the decades-long fight to protect patients with pre-existing conditions does not provide much optimism for a quick legislative fix.) For its part, the Trump administration has decided not defend the law against the attorney generals’ suit, effectively siding with those who want to overturn the law. The second part of Trump’s assertion, however, was new to us. Is he right that "some of the Democrats have been talking about ending pre-existing conditions"? We found zero evidence of this. For starters, Trump’s assertion is illogical given the Democrats’ role in passing the law and Democratic efforts to hammer Republican candidates over pre-existing condition protections on the campaign trail. Here are examples from Sens. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., Heidi Heitkamp, D-N.D., Claire McCaskill, D-Mo., and Joe Donnelly, D-Ind., and Ohio Democratic candidate for governor Richard Cordray. Drew Hammill, a spokesman for House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., said there is no such chatter among Democratic officeholders or candidates. We also asked independent health-policy experts whether they had heard any Democratic messages — or even whispers — about getting rid of pre-existing condition protections. They said they had not. "I find President Trump’s comments surprising," said Christine Eibner, a health policy specialist at the Rand Corp. "I can’t think of any," said Gail Wilensky, who headed Medicare and Medicaid under President George H.W. Bush. "No — how bad can this (rhetoric) get?" asked John Holahan, a health policy specialist at the Urban Institute. "Unbelievable," said Linda Blumberg, who also studies health policy at the Urban Institute. "No." The White House did not reply to an inquiry seeking examples. Neither did the office of the Senate majority leader or the House speaker. Our ruling Trump said, "Some of the Democrats have been talking about ending (coverage for) pre-existing conditions." We can’t find any examples of what Trump claimed Democrats were saying. A Democratic proposal to end pre-existing conditions would run 100 percent counter to Democrats’ own history with the Affordable Care Act and would undercut one of the Democrats’ most powerful messages on the campaign trail this year. We rate the statement Pants on Fire. UPDATE: Shortly after publication, we lengthened the excerpt of Trump's remarks, so readers could read his complete thought.

The claim that Jordan is leaving Nike and taking his shoes with him is just another false story circulating the internet in the wake of Colin Kaepernick’s new deal with the company. Nike made Kaepernick one of the faces of its "Just Do It" campaign, in its 30th anniversary, and debuted the first ad Sept. 3. Kaepernick confirmed the new deal on social media, generating a mixed response of praise and boycotts. Then a San Francisco 49ers quarterback, Kaepernick started kneeling during the national anthem before games in 2016 to protest the treatment of people of color in the United States. He’s been without an NFL contract for more than a year-and-a-half and has filed a collusion complaint that claims NFL owners have kept him off the field because of his protests, not because of his football ability. CharlottePost.site posted a fictitious article two days later with the headline, "BREAKING: Michael Jordan resigns from the board at Nike-takes ‘Air Jordans’ with him." This story was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) Jordan’s supposed spokesman is quoted in the article saying Jordan is "completely against the hiring of a traitor and is taking his shoes elsewhere." The spokesman’s name is Art Tubolls, an anagram of "Busta Troll."

pomt-01070	Says Mitt Romney "pays less tax than the guys who installed his car elevators."	half-true	/punditfact/statements/2015/jan/18/jennifer-granholm/former-michigan-gov-romney-pays-less-tax-guys-who-/	Count on hearing a lot about federal taxes this week. In his State of the Union address, President Barack Obama will lay out his plan to raise billions of dollars from the wealthiest people and the biggest financial institutions to make community college more affordable and pay for middle class tax cuts. And if that were not enough, we have the return of the 2012 Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney. Romney’s announcement that he’s seriously assessing a third White House bid has revived a conversation topic that bedeviled him the last go around -- that he’s too steeped in cash to connect with the struggles of the average American and benefits from a lopsided tax code. On Sunday, former Gov. Jennifer Granholm, D-Mich., gave a sign of what Romney can expect. Romney had told a gathering of Republicans in San Diego a couple days before that under Obama, "the rich have gotten richer, income inequality has gotten worse, and there are more people in poverty than ever before." Granholm said in sticking up for the little guy, Romney had an "authenticity problem." "You know, he pays less tax than the guys who installed his car elevators," Granholm said on ABC News’ This Week. We decide to look into that claim. Echoes of 2012 What car elevators, you might ask? In the spring of 2012, the public learned that Romney’s plans for a multimillion dollar beach house in La Jolla, Calif., included an elevator to move cars from the basement to street level. Think of it as a way to get more than one car into a one-car garage. This add-on costs about $55,000 fully installed. (Construction on the site is underway, and we don’t know if the elevators are done yet.) Needless to say, this was an unwanted, if minor, distraction for the Romney campaign, which was already dealing with calls to be more transparent about the governor’s financial assets. As part of his presidential campaign, the former Massachusetts governor released two years of income tax returns. They showed that in 2010, he paid 13.9 percent of his reported income in federal taxes and in 2011, 15.3 percent. Those rates were a bit less than the national average. We don’t have all the details on his tax bills. The 2011 return was incomplete, and there was the possibility that Romney’s actual tax rate would be less. With that caveat, these are the best numbers we have. Granholm’s comment mirrored a running theme from the 2012 election that the tax code treats income from work and income from investments differently. Above a certain point, income from work is taxed at a higher rate than income from the stock market. Billionaire Warren Buffett memorably distilled this down to the line that he paid a lower tax rate than his secretary thanks to the favorable treatment of capital gains. Elevator installers Assessing whether the men who installed the elevators paid more in taxes than Romney is difficult. We reached out to Granholm and did not hear back. We take her words to refer to tax rates, not the total tax amounts. Romney made about $22 million a year and paid millions in taxes both years. From the Bureau of Labor Statistics, we see that in the San Diego metro area, the average elevator installer earned $83,460 in 2013. What an installer paid in taxes varies based on a number of factors, including family situation. If the installers were single with no children, then a simple tax calculator gives them an effective federal income tax rate of 17 percent. If they were married and had a child, and had no other income, the rate would fall to 8.4 percent. However, not only is that a bare-bones estimate, it fails to include payroll taxes for Social Security and Medicare. These payments represent a substantial portion of taxes paid by the average worker. The Tax Policy Center, a project of the Urban Institute and the Brookings Institution, uses a complicated tax simulator to estimate the total tax burden. The Tax Policy Center table for 2014 gives a total effective tax rate of 15.7 percent for households making between $75,000 and $100,000 a year. Take this number only as a rough guide. It includes various kinds of income, as well as a range of tax effects, and it blends together single as well as married filers. Comparing tax rates The point is, Granholm's claim could be right or wrong -- it just depends on a person's individual circumstances. A single, childless elevator installer with wages at the higher end of the scale might be paying at a higher rate than Romney did in 2011. That person's, even before payroll taxes, could be as high as 17 percent compared to Romney’s 15.3 percent. On the other hand, someone married and caring for a child could be paying as little as 8.4 percent. Our ruling Granholm said that Romney paid less tax than the guys that installed his car elevator. On the most literal level, we don't even know if the car elevators have been installed. And we don't know anything about the people who did the work. In a broader sense, what elevator installers pay in federal taxes depends on their personal circumstances. They could be taxed at a higher -- or lower -- rate than Romney has been.

pomt-11270	Says Florida Gov. Rick Scott "just signed a bill that could make most of Florida’s beaches private."	mostly false	/florida/statements/2018/apr/26/our-future-florida/did-gov-rick-scott-sign-bill-could-make-most-beach/	Confusion about what a new law means for Florida beaches is prompting fears and political attacks. Advocacy group For Our Future Florida used HB 631 as a wedge in the U.S. Senate race, where Democratic incumbent Bill Nelson is facing a challenge from Republican Gov. Rick Scott, who signed the bill into law in March. "On #EarthDay, we want to thank @SenBillNelson who has always fought for and defended the health of Florida’s coastlines and environment, while @FLGovScott just signed a bill that could make most of Florida’s beaches private," For Our Future Florida tweeted April 22. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com Please pause before cancelling your summer vacation. This claim needs a fact-check. In reality, more than half of Florida beaches are already privately owned. The new law, opposed by many environmental groups, affects the procedure for local governments that want to make private beaches public. Starting July 1, any city or county that wants to enact an ordinance to make private beaches public will have to go through the courts. The sound bite from For Our Future Florida rests on the notion that private beach owners will use the law to limit public access. But we don’t know how those owners will react. What HB 631 will change The law Scott signed isn’t going to turn beaches that are public now over to private ownership. What it will do is make it harder to guarantee public access on beaches that were already privately owned. Before the new law, local governments could adopt ordinances guaranteeing the public’s access to privately owned beach property. Those ordinances stemmed from a legal principle known as "customary use." "Customary use" refers to the public’s historic access to the dry sand portion of the beach that may belong to a private property owner. "The idea and custom goes all the way back to ancient Rome and falls under the same set of ideas as the sea belongs to everyone and all have an equal right to use it," said David Cullen, a lobbyist for the Sierra Club, which opposed the bill. For example, the owners of an oceanfront estate in South Beach may decide they do not like that beachgoers are setting up camp on the shoreside portion of their property. They install a fence and "no trespassing" signs to tell the public to stay away. The Florida Supreme Court ruled that if a private property owner tries to do this, then the local government could enact an ordinance guaranteeing the public’s use of that land under "customary use," following their usual notice and hearing process. If landowners wanted to challenge the ordinance, they would have to sue the local government. Lawmakers drafted HB 631 to put more of the onus on the government and to establish a uniform process that includes all the stakeholders. A situation in the Panhandle’s Walton County, which passed ordinances based on this "customary use" doctrine in 2016, illustrates why some lawmakers supported the bill. After the ordinance was passed in Walton County, some beach property owners filed lawsuits to overturn it. The U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Florida upheld the county’s ordinance, but landowners appealed that decision. "Without the courts involved on the front end, individual property owners could and did sue to challenge county ordinances around the state," said Rep. Paul Renner, R-Palm Coast, in a letter to the editor for the Palm Coast Observer website. "The taxpayers were on the hook for legal fees to defend every individual case against the county and pay any damages awarded if the county got it wrong." What HB 631 means for beach access Starting July 1, local governments that seek to adopt an ordinance that is premised on customary use rights must first notify all the owners of land that might be implicated, and then file a proceeding in court. The court will decide the question of whether the public has customary use rights in that specific area. The Sierra Club’s Cullen predicts the law will embolden people to stick fences and "no trespassing" signs on their properties. If that happens, local governments will have a bigger legal hurdle to clear before guaranteeing the public’s access to that area. That said, the new law does not affect any property or beach use rights. It doesn’t affect the rights the public had to use the dry sand beach before it was enacted, nor does it affect landowners’ rights. Law experts and leaders in the beach communities emphasized that the public should not feel compelled to change patterns of historic beach usage as a result of the law’s passage. "If the public has customary use rights in a given area, the statute doesn’t change that in any way," said Alyson Flournoy, a University of Florida Levin College of Law professor. "Those common law rights exist, whether or not there is an ordinance and whether or not there has been a judicial decision. The rights may be contested, but that doesn’t mean they are any more or less valid after July 1, 2018." Our ruling For Our Future Florida said that Scott "just signed a bill that could make most of Florida’s beaches private." The law does benefit private beach owners in a way. But this is a poor explanation that obscures critical facts. The law Scott signed would not result in turning more public beaches into private ones. In reality, when the law takes effect, it will make it harder for local governments to guarantee public access to beaches that are already private by throwing in a new judicial obstacle. It’s unclear at this point how the law will change private beach access, because that depends on the actions of local governments and private beach owners. We rate this claim Mostly False.

pomt-00073	"Democrats let him (cop killer Luis Bracamontes) into our country," and "Democrats let him stay."	pants on fire!	/truth-o-meter/statements/2018/nov/01/donald-trump/donald-trumps-pants-fire-claim-democrats-let-cop-k/	In his final push before the midterms, President Donald Trump promoted a political video that says Democrats are responsible for letting a murderer stay in the country illegally to kill people. Trump tweeted a campaign-style video Oct. 31 about two California sheriff officers who were shot to death by an immigrant in the country illegally. The video opens with courtroom footage of a smiling Luis Bracamontes. Superimposed are the words, "Illegal immigrant, Luis Bracamontes, killed our people!" As Bracamontes boasts about killing the two officers and saying he would kill more if he could, new text says, "Democrats let him into our country." That’s quickly followed with, "Democrats let him stay." The video continues with footage from the caravan of Central Americans moving north in Mexico. At the end, it returns to Bracamontes’ smirking face and asks, "Who else would Democrats let in?" The final text says, "President Donald Trump and Republicans are making America safe again." Was Bracamontes in America because Democrats let him in? Not for his most recent entry. And did lax policies under Democrats let him stay? He evaded discovery, despite increasing efforts to track down criminal and immigration law offenders. The slayings Bracamontes in April was sentenced to death for the killings in California of Detective Michael Davis, Jr., and Deputy Sheriff Danny Oliver. Davis, of the Placer County Sheriff’s Office, responded in October 2014 to a call of a suspicious vehicle occupied by a man and a woman. Davis was shot as he got out of his car and later died in the hospital. Authorities said that before shooting Davis, Bracamontes also shot and killed Oliver, of the Sacramento County Sheriff's Department, when he was investigating a suspicious vehicle in a motel parking lot that same day. Authorities said Bracamontes shot Oliver in the forehead and then fled. Bracamontes was convicted of the killings in February 2018; he is currently in California's San Quentis State Prison. His wife, Janelle Monroy, was convicted of assisting Bracamontes and sentenced to nearly 25 years in prison, the Sacramento Bee reported. Tracking Bracamontes’ path Bracamontes comes from Mexico, and his adult life followed a pattern of sneaking across the border, being deported, and sneaking back in. He was arrested for drug possession in Arizona in 1996. That was in Maricopa County, the home of then-Sheriff Joe Arpaio. Federal authorities deported him in 1997. He was arrested in Arizona again in 1998, turned over to immigration authorities, but apparently not deported. Another arrest on drug and weapons charges followed in 2001, and he was deported again. (There’s one report of another arrest in Maricopa County later in 2001.) Sometime after 2001, Bracamontes moved to Utah and began using an alias. Utah court records show that between 2003 and 2009, he had 10 driving violations. But none were serious enough to require fingerprints, according to the New York Times. In 2010, Utah entered into an agreement with Immigration and Customs Enforcement, or ICE, to assist the agency in immigration enforcement. Enforcement under Democratic and Republican administrations Bracamontes’ time in America up to the killings spanned three administrations. He was arrested and deported once under Democratic President Bill Clinton, but there was a failure to deport him in 1998. He was arrested and deported again in 2001, this time under Republican President George W. Bush. He came back that same year, and was arrested again in 2001. After that, Bracamontes apparently evaded deportation through the time of his 2014 killing spree during the administration of Democratic President Barack Obama. So for eight years, from 2001 through 2008, you could argue a Republican administration failed to identify and definitively deport him. For five years, from 2009 to 2014, a Democratic administration similarly failed. (And if you want to give blame to Congress for not passing stricter laws or dedicating more resources, the two different parties shared control of Congress during the timeframe in question.) Immigration enforcement tools strengthened after 9/11 with the subsequent creation of the Department of Homeland Security, said Randy Capps, director of research for U.S. programs at the nonpartisan Migration Policy Institute. The Obama administration ramped up efforts to track down felons who were in the country illegally. It expanded the Secure Communities program launched under Bush. The program fostered information sharing among federal agencies and local jails. Immigration enforcement priorities during Obama’s first term were just as broad as they are now, with people being deported for things such as traffic violations, Capps said. Immigrant advocates in 2014 famously dubbed Obama the "deporter-in-chief." Overall, research shows that the crime rate among immigrants, including those here illegally, is lower than in the general population, Capps said. "The implication of this video is that there’s a large number of criminals in the unauthorized population, which isn’t true," Capps said. "That’s the fundamental point of this commercial, and it’s wrong." It’s not the first time that Trump has brought up Bracamontes in his narrative about illegal immigration. Trump invited the officers’ family members to his first address to a joint session of Congress in 2017, where he highlighted crimes by immigrants in the country illegally. Trump attempts to link caravan to Democrats Trump’s tweet included footage of migrants walking north to the United States, of some attempting to push through a fence at the Guatemala-Mexico border, and of a Fox News interview of a man in the caravan saying he wanted to ask for pardon. A woman translating in the video says the pardon he’s seeking is for attempted murder. Trump’s tweet suggests Democrats would let in murderers into the United States. Democrats are not telling caravans to come in, as Trump has falsely claimed. They’ve said people who seek asylum should be allowed to go through that legal process. But asylum applicants would need to be screened by Trump’s administration before being granted the immigration protection. Our ruling Trump tweeted a video that said "Democrats let him (cop killer Luis Bracamontes) into our country," and "Democrats let him stay." The reality is that Bracamontes’ last illegal entry was under Bush, a Republican president. The majority of his time going undetected was also on the Republican watch, though some of it was on the Democrats’ watch, too. Democratic and Republican administrations deported Bracamontes, but also failed to keep Bracamontes out of the United States. We found no evidence that he was proactively allowed to stay. We rate this claim Pants on Fire. Clarification: Federal immigration enforcement was reorganized after 9/11, and subsequently, Immigration and Customs Enforcement, or ICE, received its current name. This report has been updated to remove references to the name ICE prior to 2003.

pomt-04964	"Obamacare" is the "biggest tax increase in American history."	false	/wisconsin/statements/2012/jul/25/mark-neumann/biggest-tax-hike-us-history-obamacare-says-gop-us-/	Among Republicans, if there’s a topic as hot as the record-breaking heat of the summer of 2012, it’s President Barack Obama’s health care reform law. "I think it's the worst piece of legislation that's been passed in my lifetime," former Republican Wisconsin congressman Mark Neumann said. "It's stopping business from growing and creating jobs. It's the biggest tax increase in American history, likely to bankrupt this country by spending $2.6 trillion; $500 billion taken out of Medicare; the list just goes on and on and on." Neumann, who is running in the August 2012 primary for the U.S. Senate, went on at some length about his first TV ad -- which hits "Obamacare" -- during a July 10, 2012 interview with WTMJ-AM’s Charlie Sykes, a conservative talk show host in Milwaukee. But we’ll zero in on the boldest claim made by Neumann -- that the law is "the biggest tax increase in American history." Neumann’s evidence Neumann campaign manager Chip Englander cited a July 2010 article by FactCheck.org, a project based at the University of Pennsylvania. It concluded that "as measured by the rather useless yardstick of raw dollars, with no adjustment for inflation," the Affordable Care Act could be the largest tax hike in U.S. history. At $76.8 billion in 2014, the law would be the largest one-year tax increase in raw dollars since 1968, FactCheck.org said, using U.S. Treasury data. But Neuman ignores what the article goes on to say: "that attack is misleading, and the raw-dollar measure is a poor way to measure the size of a tax increase." The reason is the simple fact of inflation, which means a dollar today is worth less than one years ago. Adjusting for inflation, a 1982 tax hike under GOP President Ronald Reagan is the largest tax increase ($85.3 billion), and Obama’s health reform law drops to fourth ($71.7 billion), FactCheck.org found. And using what it called the best yardstick -- the amount of revenue raised in one year as a percentage of gross domestic product -- the health law ranks as the seventh-largest tax hike since 1968. The article’s conclusion: "There’s no way the ACA’s tax and other revenue increases come close to being the largest in U.S. history." Englander also cited a Forbes opinion column that claims the reform law is the largest tax increase if both the premiums people pay for health insurance and the penalties paid by those who don’t get insurance are considered taxes. But premiums paid to insurance companies obviously are not the same as taxes paid to the government. (On July 24, 2012, Neumann claimed a new Congressional Budget Office analysis found the law will increase taxes by $100 billion "more than anticipated." But the analysis focused on the June 2012 U.S. Supreme Court ruling on the law, which had effects on Medicaid, but didn’t make major changes to tax provisions. The new analysis found, according to the National Journal, that the law is $84 billion cheaper and that repealing it would worsen the federal deficit by $109 billion over 10 years.) Other evidence Before the FactCheck.org article was published, our colleagues at PolitiFact National also did some digging in rating as Pants on Fire an even bolder claim by Rush Limbaugh -- that the reform law is "the largest tax increase in the history of the world." They found that the health law is tied for fifth among the largest tax hikes between 1968 and 2006 as a percentage of gross domestic product. That includes the law’s penalty for not having insurance. That makes Obama’s health law a big tax increase, but not biggest. Our rating Neumann said "Obamacare" is the biggest tax increase in American history." But even the article he uses as evidence states flatly that the health care reform law is not the biggest, and that to cite raw dollars, as Neumann does, is misleading. More reliable measures put the law among the largest tax hikes, but not at the top. We rate Neumann’s statement False. Editor's note (July 25, 2012): The original version of this article incorrectly stated that the health reform law (rather than the repeal of it) would add an estimated $109 billion to the deficit.

pomt-14622	Says U.S. Sen. Ron Johnson wants to put 100,000 troops, including 25,000 Americans, "into the area where ISIS is."	half-true	/wisconsin/statements/2016/jan/29/russ-feingold/ron-johnson-wants-100000-troops-iraq-syria-fight-i/	With the 2016 campaign getting more contentious, Democrat Russ Feingold responded to a question about President Barack Obama's performance on foreign policy by pivoting to his opponent, Republican U.S. Sen. Ron Johnson. The question was posed by host Mike Gousha at a Jan. 26, 2016 forum at Marquette University Law School in Milwaukee. Feingold, who lost the Senate seat to Johnson in 2010, commented on Obama’s record in the international arena. Then he turned to terrorism, saying "no one in Washington has taken" threats from foreign extremists "as seriously as they should, and now we have to deal with it. "But those who say the way to handle it is to go put 100,000 troops into the area where ISIS is -- which is what Senator Johnson wants to do -- how does this work?" Gousha interjected, saying Johnson has talked about only 25,000 of the troops being American, with the rest coming from an international coalition. Feingold responded by asserting that Johnson said there should be 100,000 troops total, including 25,000 Americans. So let’s sort out what Johnson has called for. Johnson’s general position As the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel has reported, Johnson is among the most aggressive voices in his party in proposing a ground invasion to drive the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria out of those two countries. As early as October 2014, he called for "boots on the ground," a position in line with that of most of the 2016 GOP candidates for president. But Johnson has not been so clear about the numbers of troops. Feingold’s evidence In backing Feingold’s claim, his campaign spokesman said the former senator was referring to comments Johnson made to Gousha during a television interview in November 2015. The campaign also cited a Huffington Post article about that interview that carried this headline: "GOP senator wants a coalition of 100,000 troops in Iraq and Syria." But the headline goes further than what Johnson actually said. Here’s the exchange, with Gousha pressing Johnson for a number of American troops: Gousha: Senator, you've said on a number of occasions that you favor U.S. troops as part of this coalition going in to these countries to help move ISIS out of its safe areas. How many American troops would you support sending overseas to accomplish this mission? Johnson: Well, I'm not a military expert. The model I use is what George H.W. Bush did when Saddam Hussein went into Kuwait …. Gousha: And I know you're not a military guy, but is it 10,000? Is it 20,000? Give us some idea of what you're talking about in terms of an American presence overseas. Johnson: I've been told by military experts that ISIS -- in terms, militarily -- is not particularly capable … militarily, it really would not be that difficult. Probably it wouldn't take anywhere near the effort that the first Gulf War did. I've been hearing 25,000 troops, a total coalition of maybe 100,000. I really don't know the exact numbers, but we have to be committed to the goal …. So, Johnson didn’t commit to a number. And he hasn’t in other interviews. The previous month, Johnson said he didn’t know how many U.S. troops would be needed in Syria, although that was in reference to responding to a refugee crisis. And the following month, Johnson indicated to the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel he was open to the numbers of American troops that were being discussed. Asked if it would take more than 20,000 to 25,000 U.S. troops to retake and hold the territory now held by ISIS, he responded: "What’s the alternative? … This is a real and growing threat." But also in December 2015, Johnson said experts have talked about the need for 10,000 American troops, something he said he would support if Obama committed to an effective strategy. In contrast, Republican U.S. senators John McCain of Arizona and Lindsay Graham of South Carolina called specifically for 100,000 foreign troops to fight ISIS in Iraq and Syria. Graham also called for 10,000 American troops. Our rating Feingold said Johnson wants to put 100,000 troops, including 25,000 Americans, "into the area where ISIS is." Johnson favors sending foreign and American troops to Iraq and Syria in an effort to defeat ISIS there. He’s said he has heard experts say the effort would require 100,000 troops, including 25,000 from the United States. He indicated he might support those levels, or perhaps 10,000 American troops, but didn’t go so far as to call for any particular numbers. For a statement that is partially accurate but leaves out important details, our rating is Half True.	None	Russ Feingold	None	None	None	2016-01-29T14:16:01	2016-01-26	['United_States']
pomt-05542	"The average age of members of the House of Representatives is 57 years old."	true	/tennessee/statements/2012/apr/09/weston-wamp/25-year-old-congressional-candidate-weston-wamp-sa/	Age equals wisdom, or so the saying goes. So what do you do if you’re a young guy running for Congress? Weston Wamp, a 25-year-old Republican candidate for the U.S. House in Tennessee’s 3rd Congressional District, is trying to convince voters that his youth will be an asset in a Congress where seniority rules. Wamp is running for the House seat held for 16 years by his father, Zach Wamp, who retired from Congress in 2010 after an unsuccessful run for governor. Weston Wamp’s campaign web site portrays him as a "young entrepreneur" and a member of the "debt-paying generation" who has a broad understanding of the world and business. He also says he knows a thing or two about politics, having grown up "at the feet" of many national leaders in politics and business during his father’s congressional career. One of his underlying campaign themes seems to be that there’s a serious need for some new blood in Washington. "Of the 435 members of the House of Representatives, only two were born in the 1980s," noted a recent press release from his campaign. "The average age of members of the House of Representatives is 57 years old." We knew firsthand that both the House and the Senate are filled with gray-hairs, but we wondered if the average age in the House is really that high. We contacted Wamp’s spokeswoman, Bonnie Brezina, and asked for the source of that information. She said she wasn’t sure, but she’d get back to us. She didn’t, so we did a little digging of our own. Turns out, young Wamp is correct. The average age of U.S. House members is 57.44, according to Congressional Quarterly, a publication that provides news and analysis about Congress. "That takes into account the current makeup of the House – not when it convened in January," said David Meyers, CQ’s managing editor of member information and research. Three of the 435 House seats are currently vacant, so the average age could go up or down slightly once those three seats are filled. The average age of the Senate’s 100 members as of January 2011 was 61.5, according to the Senate Historical Office. Wamp also was right on another front: Only two House members – U.S. Reps. Aaron Schock, R-Ill., and Justin Amash, R-Mich. -- were born in 1980 or later. Schock is 30; Amash is 31. Other publications have noted the advanced age of Congress. When President Barack Obama entered the White House in January 2009, USA Today reported that Obama – one of the nation’s youngest presidents – would be working with the nation’s oldest Congress. When Obama took the oath of office, the average age was 57 in the House and 63 in the Senate, the paper said. In each case, it was the highest on record. Our ruling We won’t attempt to fact-check the argument that age equals wisdom. But on Wamp’s claim that the average age of House members is 57, the young Republican is correct and earns a True rating on the Truth-o-Meter.

pomt-01127	"We've caught Iran cheating on the interim (nuclear) deal."	mostly false	/punditfact/statements/2014/dec/31/stephen-hayes/hayes-iran-cheated-interim-nuclear-deal/	As the pundits look ahead to 2015, they know that time is running out for the United States to reach a permanent deal with Iran over its nuclear program. The five permanent members of the United Nations Security Council — China, France, Russia, the United Kingdom and the United States — along with Germany, have until mid March to come to terms on a deal with the Islamic republic. If all goes the way the United States hopes, a signed agreement will keep Iran out of the nuclear weapons club. For now, the two sides are operating under an interim agreement, which rolls back Iran’s stock of enriched uranium and freezes the country’s capability to produce nuclear materials that could be used to make a nuclear bomb. In exchange, Iran can sell its oil more freely and gain access to millions of dollars in frozen assets. On Fox News Sunday Dec. 28, 2014, Stephen Hayes of the conservative Weekly Standard magazine spoke skeptically about what lies ahead. Hayes believes a final deal is likely, but he doubts the Obama administration will drive a hard bargain. "They want the deal for the sake of having the deal," Hayes said. "We basically caught -- we've caught Iran cheating on the interim deal and rather than saying, ‘Look, we're done, you've proven that you're not an effective partner, that we can't trust you,’ they say, ‘We'll give you more time because we're going to get to a deal.’ " We decided to check whether Iran was caught cheating on the interim agreement. Hayes told us he had two violations in mind. The one most tightly tied to Iran’s nuclear program had to do with Iran’s work with a new model of centrifuge. Centrifuges are key to enriching uranium and enriched uranium is key to making a bomb. The other violation had to do with Iran selling more oil than it is allowed. In our research, we found a third possible violation involving Iran buying parts for its heavy water reactor in Arak. What we discovered is that while Iran isn’t squeaky clean, no point is definitively in violation of the interim agreement. Importantly, the International Atomic Energy Agency has reported no violations with the Joint Plan of Action. We’ll deal with each potential violation in turn. Work with a new model of centrifuge One of the pillars of the interim agreement, the Joint Plan of Action, was to freeze Iran’s centrifuge facilities. It could keep the tens of thousands of centrifuges it has and could repair any that were broken, but it couldn’t expand its capacity. As part of the agreement, Iran could continue some limited research and development work. A problem emerged in November when the International Atomic Energy Agency reported that in the "R&D area," Iran "has been intermittently feeding natural UF6 (uranium fluoride) into the IR-5 centrifuge." Agency inspectors said that no enriched uranium emerged because the Iranians recombined everything back together at the end of the run. This set off red flags because, until then, the Iranians had not fed uranium fluoride into that particular centrifuge. "Iran was caught red-handed engaged in centrifuge activities," Hayes said. "When confronted by the State Department, Iran stopped feeding the IR-5." Hayes relied on an assessment from the Institute for Science and International Security, a Washington-based group that aims to stop the spread of nuclear weapons. In November, the institute initially said, "The feeding of the IR-5 centrifuge is an apparent violation of that commitment to freeze centrifuge R&D activities." Hayes told us that he took an "apparent violation" to be the equivalent of cheating. But David Albright, the institute’s president, said that after a closer look, it wasn’t that cut and dried. "It’s hard to say definitively one way or the other on the question of a clear violation," Albright told PunditFact. Albright and his group’s latest assessment is that the Joint Plan of Action didn’t specifically allow the Iranians to feed the uranium into the IR-5 centrifuge. But it’s not clear if that constitutes a violation. Albright said that an administration official told him that the action was "inconsistent with the United States’ understanding of the Joint Plan of Action." That could be a diplomatic way of saying there had been a violation, or it might mean that the original agreement was unclear, a lawyer told Albright. What is clear: The Americans asked Iran to stop, and Iran did. Adam Mount, a nuclear security fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations, said as far as anyone can tell, the interim agreement has achieved what it set out to do. "There is no publicly available evidence that Iran has violated the terms of the Joint Plan of Action," Mount said. "Progress on the Iranian nuclear program is frozen and in some of the most important areas, it has been rolled back." Daryl Kimball, executive director of the Arms Control Association, a group that hopes to see a final nuclear agreement with Iran, said it would have been better if Iran hadn’t fed the uranium into the IR-5 centrifuge. "Was it useful or helpful?" Kimball asked. "No. Was it specifically prohibited by the Joint Plan of Action? Also no. There is a big difference between the Iranians have been caught cheating, and a dispute about the one centrifuge." In sum, the weight of the evidence says that it would have been better if Iran had not fired up that IR-5 centrifuge, but doing so didn’t rise to the level of violating the interim agreement. Iran sold too much oil Hayes’ second contention is that Iran sold more oil than allowed as part of the interim agreement. "Iran violated the terms of the Joint Plan of Action by exporting more crude than the agreement allowed, specifically to China, India, Japan and South Korea," Hayes told us. For evidence, Hayes pointed us to a Reuters article that reported that in the first nine months of 2014, sales to those countries had risen nearly 20 percent from the year before, to about 1.14 million barrels per day. But again, things aren’t so cut and dried. The Joint Plan of Action says that the five Security Council countries and Germany would stop trying to reduce the amount of oil that Iran could sell. It also says that countries can continue to buy "their current average amounts of crude oil." There are no specific caps, however, and no clear explanation of what would constitute a violation. We spoke to Mark Dubowitz, who is executive director of the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, a group that monitors enforcement of sanctions against Iran. Dubowitz said he believes both Iran and the countries that bought its oil skirted the deal. But ultimately, Dubowitz said we can’t know for sure whether Iran’s oil sales violate the terms of the agreement because we lack access to a critical piece. Behind the public summary of the Joint Plan of Action is a much more detailed implementation agreement. Only people with a certain level of security clearance can see it. "We don’t know what that says," Dubowitz said. "Iran’s sales might be a violation. Or they might not." Also, several of the countries that are buying Iran’s oil, such as India, Japan and South Korea, didn’t sign the interim agreement and thus wouldn’t be bound by it. And lastly, while the United States has set limits on the amount of oil Iran can sell, those are not written into the Joint Plan of Action. Buying parts for a heavy water reactor Some analysts we reached thought Hayes might have been thinking of another potential problem with Iran. According to some reports, it has continued to buy parts that could be used in its heavy water reactor, which is another means to produce fuel for a nuclear bomb. However, even if those reports are accurate, the activity falls outside the interim agreement. Matthew Kroenig is a professor of international relations at Georgetown University. Kroenig would not call these purchases a violation of the Joint Plan of Action. On the other hand, Kroenig said that shouldn’t make anyone feel any better. "It is in violation of U.N. sanctions prohibiting Iranian procurement of sensitive nuclear technology," Kroenig said. "It also might reveal something about how sincere Iran is about shutting down or converting the reactor as part of a final deal." Our ruling Hayes said Iran had been caught cheating on the interim deal to rein in Iran’s nuclear program, called the Joint Plan of Action. First, the International Atomic Energy Agency has reported no violations with the Joint Plan of Action. That said, there are some actions by Iran that certainly cut near the boundaries of the terms of the agreement. Iran has worked with a new kind of centrifuge that, while perhaps not a formal violation, does seem to contradict the United States’ understanding of the deal, an expert told us. When confronted on the matter, Iran stopped its work. Also, there is some question about the amount of oil Iran is exporting. But an expert said we just don’t have enough information to determine whether that constitutes a violation of the agreement or not. Hayes said we caught Iran cheating. You can say some allege that, and you can say there’s some evidence that might suggest that. But we found no hand in the cookie jar. As such, we rate this claim Mostly False.

pomt-03490	Says Democratic Party created Planned Parenthood	false	/virginia/statements/2013/jun/10/stephen-martin/state-sen-stephen-martin-says-democartic-party-cre/	In defending controversial statements by the Republican Party’s candidate for lieutenant governor, State Sen. Steve Martin made some of his own. Martin, R-Chesterfield, attended a May 23 fundraiser for E.W. Jackson, the GOP nominee for the No. 2 spot. A Richmond Times-Dispatch reporter asked Martin to weigh in on a video from last fall in which Jackson denounced the the Democratic Party, the Ku Klux Klan and Planned Parenthood in the same breath. "The fact is that both the KKK and Planned Parenthood are creations of the Democratic Party," Martin said. We recently gave a False rating to Martin’s claim that the Democratic Party started the KKK. In this Truth-O-Meter, we’ll look at his contention that the party started Planned Parenthood. Planned Parenthood founder Margaret Sanger began her crusade for birth control access through a magazine called "The Woman Rebel" that she started in 1914. Sanger was subsequently arrested and charged with mailing obscene materials because the magazine championed birth control, which was illegal, and published information on sex. But the Democratic Party was not involved in her trials nor her opening of clinics in Brownsville, N.Y., in 1916 or in Harlem in 1923, according to the book "Margaret Sanger: A Life of Passion." The book’s author, Jean H. Baker, sent us an email saying Sanger "abstained from any political commitments." The book says Sanger was angered by politicians from both parties who refused to back birth control programs, including Democratic Presidents Franklin Roosevelt and John Kennedy. Baker attributed the opposition to the doctrine and power of the Catholic Church rather than any political party creed. Sanger founded the American Birth Control League in 1921. Members during its first decade were typically upper-middle-class women of childbearing age, according to the book "Woman of Valor: Margaret Sanger and the Birth Control Movement in America." The author, Ellen Chesler, wrote that of the members of the league willing to to list their party affiliation, "just over half said they were Republicans, while 8 percent identified themselves as Socialists, reflecting the movement’s, and Margaret’s own, idiosyncratic histories." Sanger resigned in 1928 as president of the league, which became the Planned Parenthood Federation of America in 1940. Is there any evidence the Democratic Party created Planned Parenthood? When we asked Martin, he told us he phrased his claim poorly and should have said the Democratic Party has "sustained" Planned Parenthood. Soon after our conversation, Martin released a statement saying he "regretted the carelessness and inaccuracy" of his comments." Although it’s not the purpose of this article to examine whether the Democratic Party has "sustained" Planned Parenthood, we should note that Martin’s substitute claim needs qualification. Congress did not start funding birth control efforts until 1967 -- 46 years after Sanger founded the organization that would become Planned Parenthood. For a long time afterwards, there was strong bipartisan support for funding birth control organizations. Only in 2011, with abortion debate heating up, were there partisan floor votes in which the GOP sought to strip federal money from Planned Parenthood and the Democrats insisted on preserving it. House Republicans have introduced another bill this year to end taxpayer funding for the organization. Planned Parenthood reported receiving $524 million from the U.S. government in grants and payments during the fiscal year that ended last Sept. 30 -- roughly 45 percent of the organization’s revenues. Our ruling Martin said that Planned Parenthood was created by the Democratic Party. There’s no evidence to support that claim. Biographers of Margaret Sanger, the founder of Planned Parenthood, say she shunned political commitments and was critical of presidents from both parties. Recognizing that Martin has since expressed regret for his words, we rate his statement False.	None	Stephen Martin	None	None	None	2013-06-10T13:00:00	2013-05-23	['None']
pomt-04490	Says President Obama has "doubled" the deficit.	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/oct/05/mitt-romney/mitt-romney-says-barack-obama-has-doubled-deficit/	During the first presidential debate in Denver, Mitt Romney took President Barack Obama to task for his record on the deficit. "The president said he’d cut the deficit in half," Romney said. "Unfortunately, he doubled it." We already ruled the first half of this statement True, noting that Obama said on Feb. 23, 2009, "Today I am pledging to cut the deficit we inherited in half by the end of my first term in office." But what about Romney’s second claim, that Obama "doubled" the deficit he inherited? Romney is way off. The final Congressional Budget Office baseline deficit projection before Obama took office -- noted in table 5 in this January 2009 CBO report -- showed a fiscal year 2009 deficit of $1.19 trillion. That figure doesn’t account for any of Obama’s own spending initiatives, such as the stimulus bill. But the deficit grew quickly under Obama: The fiscal 2009 deficit rose to $1.41 trillion and has remained above $1 trillion annually ever since. But compared to what Obama inherited, the annual deficit has gone down slightly. CBO projects that for fiscal 2012, which has just ended, the fiscal 2012 deficit will be $1.09 trillion. So, far from doubling the deficit, Obama (along with, it should be noted, some Republican help in Congress) has instead reduced the deficit by about 8 percent. The only way to get to doubling is to use a different starting point, which is what the Romney campaign does. His campaign compares the current deficit to the final fiscal 2008 deficit of $458.6 billion. But we don't find that to be the correct starting point. Romney was referring to a statement Obama made on Feb. 23, 2009, so the correct comparison would be the deficit at that point. The 2008 deficit covered a fiscal year that ended about four months before Obama took office -- and which was also a period of rapid economic deterioration that affected the scale of CBO’s deficit projections. So CBO’s January 2009 figure offers a much more accurate indication of what Obama "inherited" -- which, we should repeat, is the word Obama used in his broken promise of February 2009. Romney would still have been off if he had said the federal debt, rather than deficit, had doubled on Obama’s watch. The debt held by the public -- one of two key measures of federal debt -- rose from $6.3 trillion on Jan. 20, 2009, to $11.3 trillion on the day of the debate, an increase of 79 percent. The total federal debt, which includes debt the government holds itself, rose by a smaller amount over that period, 53 percent. Our ruling Romney said that Obama has "doubled" the deficit. In reality, using the most appropriate comparison, he and Congress have actually decreased the deficit slightly. We rate Romney’s statement False.

pomt-04038	"Today, about 40 percent of guns are purchased without a background check."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2013/jan/30/kirsten-gillibrand/gillibrand-says-40-percent-guns-sold-today-escape-/	Gun control advocates are lining up behind President Barack Obama’s call for a law requiring universal background checks on gun purchases. "The background checks bill is vitally important," New York Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand said in an interview on MSNBC Jan. 24, 2013. It’s "going to basically say you can’t buy guns without getting a background check. Today, about 40 percent of guns are purchased without a background check." If the figure sounds familiar, it’s because gun control advocates are citing it with abandon. Obama mentioned it in the White House ceremony outlining his slate of new gun restrictions. A white paper by researchers at Johns Hopkins University asserts it without qualification. Indeed, it’s a powerful claim: that 40 percent of guns are bought and sold in America with no paper trail, no fingerprint of the hands they fall into. Gillibrand is right that federal law does not require background checks on all gun purchases, contrary to what polls show most Americans support. It’s the 40-percent figure that’s the sticking point. We have examined this claim before at PolitiFact, when New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg said in July 2012, "There's a loophole where you can sell guns without a background check … 40 percent of guns are sold that way" at gun shows and over the Internet. At the time we rated the claim Mostly True. But since the Newtown, Conn., school shooting, we’ve heard the statistic repeated again and again, plus seen criticism of its use. So we’ve decided to take another look. We have since re-rated the Bloomberg fact-check to Half True. The 1997 study The original source of the 40 percent figure is a 1997 National Institute of Justice study by researchers Philip Cook of Duke University and Jens Ludwig of the University of Chicago, who examined data from a 1994 telephone survey about gun ownership. The survey, which sampled 2,568 homes, asked owners an array of questions, including how many guns were in the house, what they were used for, how they were stored and how they were obtained. But it’s important to note that of the 2,568 households surveyed, only 251 people answered the question about the origin of their gun. But in those answers, Cook and Ludwig found that 35.7 percent of respondents reported obtaining their gun from somewhere other than a licensed dealer. (That has been rounded up to 40 percent.) Some people answered "probably" and "probably not" if they weren’t entirely sure whether the seller was a licensed dealer. In some cases, where the respondent skipped the question about whether the gun came from a licensed dealer, the researchers made a judgment call. Ludwig said in an email that they mined answers to other questions (such as whether the gun was a gift) to guide them. "Our approach ... was to be conservative in estimating what fraction of sales are in the primary market," Ludwig wrote. "Primary market" refers to guns sold by dealers in retail stores or pawn shops. The "secondary market" includes gun shows and other transactions where a background check is not required. Some critics find fault with the 40 percent figure because it includes guns that are inherited or won -- in other words, transactions that could reasonably be assumed not to involve a background check. The NRA, arguably the loudest voice of opposition to tighter gun controls, referenced the study in a recent blog post. The group does not dispute the method or findings of the study but says the 40 percent claim is a misinterpretation by gun control advocates. We’re confident that the study, conducted by respected researchers using the best available evidence, was reliable in its time. What’s less clear: how reliable it remains today. ‘I have no idea’ We asked Cook, the other study author, what he thought about the 40 percent figure being referenced so frequently since gun control lurched back to the forefront of the national debate. "I’ve been amazed at how much interest there’s been in it. It’s been lying there dormant for 20 years," he said. So is it still a current, reliable estimate of secondary market gun sales? "The answer is I have no idea," Cook said. "This survey was done almost 20 years ago. … It’s clear there are a lot of transactions that are not through dealers. How many, we’re not really clear on it. … We would say it’s a very old number." Other scholars had similar views. "I don’t see how anyone could know that number," said James Jacobs, Center for Research in Crime and Justice at New York University School of Law. Paul Blackman is a retired criminologist and former research coordinator for the NRA Institute for Legislative Action. "Personally, I think your safest bet is to say that no one knows, but that the vast majority of crime guns come from some other source than gun shows," he told us. One expert, David Kopel at the University of Denver law school, said he doesn’t think the figure was ever accurate because of what the survey actually asked. "The study did not say whether there was a background check on the sale. It asked the buyer, do you think there was? So some buyers may have known, some may not have known," Kopel said. "All it measured was buyer perception, not whether a check actually occurred." A stable market We looked but couldn’t find any more recent studies like Cook’s and Ludwig’s. Some gun control advocates blame a federal freeze on funding gun research for the lack of new data. But even absent that, some experts argue that little has changed about the gun market in the decades since the study was conducted. "It’s a fairly stable market. That is to say, gun stores have had their part, police supply stores have had their part, and then there are the gun shows and private dealings about which we know very little," said Robert McCrie, of the John Jay College of Criminal Justice. "To be sure, there has been this bump up in gun purchases, which we know from reports from gun stores and the companies like Smith & Wesson. There’s the knowledge that the market has been more vigorous and probably that higher vigor has been reflected in gun shows and private sales in tandem." His take: "The 40 percent seems about right." Jay Corzine has attended and studies gun shows in Florida. The University of Central Florida professor says that based on his observation, no more than 15 to 20 percent of sales at gun shows happen without a background check. But when you add in other private sales -- neighbors selling to neighbors, ads in the paper, etc. -- the 40 percent figure is "probably accurate" and "a very good figure to use." Gary Kleck, whose research has provided the foundation for less restrictive concealed carry laws, agrees that conditions in the gun market haven’t changed much. "I know of no affirmative reason to think that the methods of acquiring guns has significantly changed in recent decades, or that conditions have changed such that private (non-dealer) transfers have become more (or less) important. The laws regulating gun sales have not gotten significantly more (or less) strict since the 1994 Brady Act, so there's no strong basis for expecting fewer dealer sales or more non-dealer sales as a result of legal changes," Kleck, a professor at Florida State University, wrote in an email. Kleck says the 40 percent estimate is "probably still reasonably valid today." But he further argues that this fact shouldn’t guide new policy, because the problem is not how legal, background-checked purchasers are obtaining guns, but how criminals are. Our ruling Gillibrand claimed that "today, about 40 percent of guns are purchased without a background check." She, and other gun control advocates who have cited that figure, correctly repeated the findings of a well-respected study about gun ownership. There’s no question that many guns are bought and sold in America without the oversight of a background check. But is 40 percent true "today," as Gillibrand said? Even the author of the original study says nobody knows. By mentioning the statistic as if it is current and accurate, Gillibrand revealed nothing of the fact that the figure is almost 20 years old. That’s an essential detail that people engaged in the gun debate should know. All this leads us to rate her statement Half True.

pomt-11398	"The state is set to recapture an additional $500 million in Robin Hood payments from taxpayers and not one penny of it will go to public education in Texas."	false	/texas/statements/2018/mar/23/mike-collier/mike-collier-says-pending-robin-hood-funds-wont-fu/	For the sake of equity, state law since the 1990s has required Texas school districts with lucrative property-tax bases to share revenue with the state to help balance funding for less fortunate districts. In 2018, according to the state, the so-called Robin Hood or "recapture" system resulted in 185 districts sending $2 billion to the state. In raw dollars, the biggest givers were the Austin, Houston and Plano districts; the Austin district’s contribution exceeded $544 million. And that money gets spent on education, right? Not so in the state’s next budget year, Mike Collier of Houston, the 2018 Democratic nominee for lieutenant governor, declared. In a March 18, 2018 tweet that made us wonder, Collier said: "The state is set to recapture an additional $500 million in Robin Hood payments from taxpayers and not one penny of it will go to public education in Texas. Instead, the state government is confiscating our property tax dollars to pay its own bills." That $500 million figure, Collier later told us by email, ties to how much more the state budget written by the 2017 Legislature takes from wealthy districts in the budget year beginning Sept. 1, 2019 compared to the amount so budgeted for the previous year. In fact, the budget shows the upcoming recapture total of $2,521,000,000 running $471.1 million ahead of the $2,049,900,000 budgeted for the previous 12 months. Money coming to the state from that increase "does not go to any school," Collier said in a statement emailed by Scott Spiegel of his campaign. Collier further noted that the state budget shows education aid drawn from state tax collections decreasing by $1.6 billion, from $19.1 billion in fiscal 2018 to nearly $17.5 billion through August 2019. "So despite higher recapture payments, overall funding is down," Collier said. "The only way anyone could argue that $500 million increase in recapture payments was staying in schools would be to show an overall increase in school funding by $500 million," he said. Checking figures, state law Collier overlooked some spending; the education part of the budget lists more than a dozen revenue sources including proceeds from the state’s lottery and federal aid. All told, the budget shows, lawmakers voted to spend $28.2 billion on public education in fiscal 2018 with that commitment dropping to $27.2 billion the next year. Meantime, experts including R.J. DeSilva, staff spokesman for the Legislative Budget Board, which advises lawmakers on fiscal matters, indicated it’s not legally possible for recapture funds not to support education. State law specifies that recapture "receipts shall be deposited in the state treasury and may be used only for foundation school program purposes," meaning the state’s primary way of funding schools. To our inquiries, school advocates said Collier made a solid point about local property values reducing pressure to spend state revenue on education. By email, Joe Wisnoski, a former Texas Education Agency official who lobbies for districts, called Collier’s tweet "false to the extent that it implies recapture funds are directly spent on functions of state government other than public education." Yet Wisnoski and Tom Canby of the Texas Association of School Business Officials each noted that any escalation in recapture amounts, influenced by increases in local property values, enables lawmakers to pony up less state revenue toward delivering each district the aid it’s entitled to receive based on state formulas rooted in changes in enrollment and its mix of students. Wisnoski wrote: "State aid earned by school districts is based on formulas set in statute, and the amount of recapture in and of itself does not impact those formulas directly. Recapture is a method of finance for the appropriation for the Foundation School Program, so increased recapture means the state needs to draw less money from other sources to total up to the amount of Foundation School Program state aid, like state general revenue." By phone, Josh Sanderson of the Equity Center, which says it advocates for "chronically underfunded" districts, similarly agreed that by law all recaptured dollars go to fund education. But when local property values are expected to increase, the state can budget fewer state tax dollars to fulfill its commitments, Sanderson said. He pointed out that the 2018-19 state budget presumes that local property values, and related tax collections, will increase 7.04 percent through August 2018 and by 6.77 percent the next tax year. "Any property value increases essentially serve to offset the state’s share" of formula-set funding, Sanderson said. He called Collier’s statement sort of correct and sort of incorrect, elaborating: "He’s incorrect in saying that Robin Hood payments don’t go to benefit public education. However, he’s correct in saying it’s effectively reducing what the state puts in." We also asked the Texas Education Agency to appraise Collier’s claim; we didn’t hear back. Our ruling Collier said Texas state government is set to take $500 million more from taxpayers in certain school districts "and not one penny of it will go to public education in Texas." This claim waves at a general truth that lawmakers can spend less state revenue on education provided local property values escalate. But by law, the $471 million more in recapture funds set to flow from districts to the state this next budget year must be deposited in the state treasury to be used only to fund education. This statutory reality makes Collier’s claim False. FALSE – The statement is not accurate. Click here for more on the six PolitiFact ratings and how we select facts to check.

pomt-08777	U.S. Rep. Jim Marshall (D-Ga.) refuses to return $37,000 in "dirty" campaign contributions from U.S. Rep. Charles Rangel (D-N.Y.)	half-true	/georgia/statements/2010/aug/23/national-republican-congressional-committee/marshall/	Republicans are raising questions about a controversial campaign contributor to a Democratic Georgia congressman. The National Republican Congressional Committee put together a recorded telephone message that it said went to residents on Aug. 10 in Democrat Jim Marshall's congressional district in Middle Georgia. The message said U.S. Rep. Charles Rangel, who is in a heap of ethics trouble, made $37,000 in campaign contributions to Marshall. Rangel, a Democrat from New York City, is facing 13 ethics charges largely surrounding whether he used his office for personal gain. Rangel admits to belatedly reporting hundreds of thousands of dollars in income and assets. But Rangel insists he's not corrupt. The RNCC urges Marshall in the message to give the money back. "So far, Congressman Marshall's fellow Democrats have returned almost $640,000 in dirty campaign money from Rangel," the unidentified voice in the message says. "Yet, Congressman Marshall refuses to return $37,000." Is a New York congressman who is under an ethics cloud helping fund the campaign of a Middle Georgia congressman running for re-election? AJC PolitiFact Georgia contacted Marshall's office about the NRCC allegation. Our initial search of federal campaign contributions from Rangel for Congress showed the congressman sent just $9,000 to Marshall. Marshall's spokesman Doug Moore said the GOP has included money from a political action committee Rangel is involved with called "National Leadership PAC." In all, Moore said Marshall has received $38,000. But that money arrived before Rangel's ethics problems, Moore said. A leadership PAC is a fundraising device politicians to back other candidates. National Leadership PAC is Rangel's PAC. It collects money that is then doled out to other Democrats running for office. Moore called it a "technicality" to say the money from the National Leadership PAC is from Rangel. Moore argued the message is misleading because all of contributions were made by 2007, a year before the ethics allegations surfaced. Marshall has since refused to accept contributions from Rangel or the PAC, Moore said. Marshall represents Georgia's 8th Congressional District, which includes Macon and much of Middle Georgia. It's considered a swing district that Republicans are eager to seize this fall in their attempt to win control of Congress. Marshall has won several close races in recent years. Linking him to Rangel, a liberal with ethics issues, could damage Marshall this election cycle, experts say. "(Republicans) are trying to say this guy might be dirty like the rest of them," said Emory University associate political science professor Michael Leo Owens. Marshall is trying to distance himself from such comparisons. He told PolitiFact Georgia in a statement that "if Rangel is indeed guilty of the charges, he should have resigned a long time ago." Anthony Corrado, an expert in campaign finance laws, said it is common practice for members of Congress to give money from their PACs to fellow members facing tough re-election battles. The National Leadership PAC donated $899,000 to various Democratic candidates in 2008, said Corrado, a government professor at Colby College in Maine. National Leadership is probably one of the top 10 PACs in terms of donations, Corrado said. Corrado said candidates return money to someone or an organization that becomes politically liable. However, he said that Rangel giving money to Marshall during the last election cycle does not carry the same weight as if the contributions were made after Rangel's ethics allegations went public. "It's not the same," he said. Kennesaw State University political science professor Kerwin Swint agreed with Owens that the RNCC is smart to attempt to link Marshall with Rangel. However, Swint said the robocall is "slightly misleading" because it does not mention that contributions were made before the ethics allegations emerged. "That's politics," Swint said. "All is fair." So is the NRCC's message correct? The total amount of money was off by $1,000. But a point that concerned us more is that the contributions were made before the allegations surfaced. Anyone who hears the message would not know from it when the contributions were made, which made a difference to every expert we spoke with. We believe the statement does contain some truth. But it leaves out important details and takes some things out of context. On our Truth-o-Meter scale, that rates as Half True.

pomt-07214	Oil companies are able to sell oil that costs no more to produce today than it did one year ago.	mostly true	/oregon/statements/2011/jun/04/jeff-merkley/jeff-merkley-says-oil-production-costs-are-flat-ye/	For all of you who’ve watched the spinning numbers at the gas pump, PolitiFact Oregon offers a new challenge -- calculating the cost of finding oil and bringing it to the surface. Oregon Sen. Jeff Merkley believes he’s cracked the code. He claimed as much in a May 16, 2011, speech on the Senate floor in which he urged his colleagues to pass legislation that would strip $2 billion in annual tax subsidies from the five biggest oil companies. (The bill failed.) "So the companies are able to sell oil that costs no more to produce today than it did one month ago, no more to produce today than it did three months ago, when oil was much lower, no more expensive to produce today than one year ago, when it was $3 a gallon," he said, noting that the price of oil as he spoke was $100 a barrel. With the economics of oil in constant flux, we will focus on the last part of Merkley’s assertion, that oil is "no more expensive to produce today than one year ago." The ultimate price is derived from a complicated -- and dense -- synthesis of fixed costs, the financial markets, geopolitical developments (Libya, for example) and global economics. That includes actual fixed costs such as transporting and refining oil in addition to a highly fluctuating value added by commodity traders. That’s why members of Congress, including Merkley, have been asking so many questions of late about the role of market speculators who by some estimates can add $20 or more to the cost of a barrel of oil. To back up his claim, Merkley cites a report by Democrats on the Finance Committee that finds production costs roughly the same from year to to year. That number, however, includes oil from old and very large fields that is much cheaper than oil from new and smaller deposits. He also points to testimony by ExxonMobil CEO Rex Tillerson to the Senate Finance Committee on May 12, 2011. Tillerson, who was actually responding to a question about the impact of speculators, seemed to corroborate Merkley’s suggestion that the production cost has been stable. Noting that it’s hard to judge, Tillerson estimated the cost at $60 to $70 a barrel. That includes all production costs, but not the additional costs added by the financial markets. John Felmy, the chief economist for the oil industry’s trade group, the American Petroleum Institute, argues that Merkley is "flat out wrong." The costs fluctuate, he says, based on location, competition for crews and equipment and a host of other factors. There’s also this: The true cost of finding oil and bringing it to the surface, which is known as the "lifting cost," is directly tied to the size of the deposit. The bigger the reserve, the lower the cost. That’s a problem these days,Felmy says, because oil "is getting progressively harder to find," which means the deposit is usually smaller and the overall cost higher. Tillerson also raised the point that the costs of finding oil and bringing it to the surface increase as supplies dwindle. But he said that the industry has become more efficient and used improvements in technology to keep costs lower, making total production costs roughly the same. It’s also worth noting that the "finding costs" are only a fraction of the total cost of a barrel of oil. The Energy Information Administration, a federal department that independently collects and synthesizes data about energy production and costs, also shows production costs roughly the same from 2006 to 2009. Those are the most recent years for which data has been collected and published. While the total price of oil is known each day, EIA economist Neal Davis said, data on the production of oil lags more than a year behind. For that reason, he said, it’s impossible to conclusively say whether Merkley’s assertion is correct or not. He also said that costs vary from year to year so it is difficult to draw conclusions on future costs based on a previous year. Because no absolute answer can be given until new data is available, we think Merkley’s statement needs clarification. But his fundamental point -- that total production costs haven’t changed much in recent years -- is largely correct. Even Exxon CEO Tillerson says total production costs are relatively stable. We rate Merkley’s claim: Mostly True. Comment on this item.	None	Jeff Merkley	None	None	None	2011-06-04T06:00:00	2011-06-16	['None']
pomt-00075	"The Democrats want to invite caravan after caravan of illegal aliens into our country. And they want to sign them up for free health care, free welfare, free education, and for the right to vote."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2018/nov/01/donald-trump/donald-trump-falsely-says-democrats-invite-migrant/	President Donald Trump is rallying support for Republican candidates in the midterm elections with sweeping rhetoric about Democrats looking out for waves of "illegal aliens" over the interests of Americans. "The Democrats want to invite caravan after caravan of illegal aliens into our country," Trump said Oct. 26 at a campaign rally in Charlotte, N.C. "And they want to sign them up for free health care, free welfare, free education, and for the right to vote." A caravan of Central American migrants is in southern Mexico trekking north to the Mexico-U.S. border. Some are fleeing gangs in Central America and plan to request asylum in the United States. Others say they are migrating due to poverty in their home countries. (Here’s what we know about the caravan, and here’s a round-up of misinformation about it.) The White House did not provide an on-the-record response to back Trump’s claim. Democrats have said immigrants should be allowed the legal right to ask for asylum, but that’s not the same as inviting caravans to come to the United States. They also haven’t said they want to "sign them up" for benefits or to vote illegally, or to go beyond existing laws. No Democratic invitation for caravans Democrats have largely remained silent about the caravan, focusing instead on Republicans and health care as the Nov. 6 Election Day nears. Some Democrats have said that immigrants seeking asylum should be allowed to go through that legal process, but that’s not necessarily extending an invitation. CNN’s Jake Tapper in an Oct. 23 interview asked Tom Perez, chairman of the Democratic National Committee, to address the Democratic Party’s message about the caravan and whether they’d be allowed to "come in and apply for refugee status." "We are a nation of laws, and the laws that are on the books deal with issues of refugee and asylum status, and those are the laws that have always applied," Perez said. "It's a humanitarian issue of significance, and our laws require that people be treated with dignity and given that process." Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif., made a similar statement. "Our strength has always been that we are a tolerant country, that we are welcoming in particular those who have fled harm," Harris said Oct. 22 in Iowa, according to CNN. "The idea that we're vilifying any one group, and the fear-mongering — that's not in the best interest of our country." House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi and Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer in an Oct. 20 joint statement said Trump was "desperate to change the subject from health care to immigration because he knows that health care is the number one issue Americans care about," adding that Republicans "are making a mess of our health care system." Pelosi reiterated that message in another statement: "Despite Republicans’ fear-mongering, this group of families may not even make it to the U.S. border, and those migrating for economic reasons will not qualify for asylum." Caravan members are also not "illegal aliens," said Stephen Legomsky, a professor emeritus at the Washington University School of Law in St. Louis, who served as chief counsel of U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services during the Obama administration. "Of course the U.S. isn’t obligated to grant asylum to everyone who applies," said Legomsky, "but upon reaching the border they have a legal right, explicitly granted by Congress, to apply for it." "Sign them up for free health care, free welfare, free education, and for the right to vote" Democrats aren’t saying they want to sign up caravan members for perks upon arrival, much less the right to vote without being U.S. citizens. PolitiFact has repeatedly debunked Trump’s claims of mass voter fraud. Even if some caravan members were granted asylum and became citizens, it would take several years before they are able to vote for candidates for federal office. (A small number of jurisdictions allow noncitizens to vote in local races.) "The only caravan members who might one day become eligible to vote would be those who are found to meet all the legal requirements for asylum, later acquire green cards, and then eventually become naturalized citizens," Legomsky said. A person must be a green card holder for at least five years and meet certain other requirement before applying for U.S. citizenship. If granted asylum, immigrants do become eligible for Medicaid and other forms of government assistance, Legomsky said. Federal law bars immigrants in the country illegally from most public assistance programs. However, they can receive free school lunches, the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) and emergency medical care. "Concern over illegal immigrants placing significant demands on public service is well founded," said Steven Camarota, director of research at the Center for Immigration Studies, a think tank that favors low immigration levels. "But it is not some moral defect on their part, rather it reflects the very low education levels of this population and resulting low income and them needing services." A 1982 U.S. Supreme Court case also said that immigrants, regardless of immigration status, are allowed free elementary and secondary education. "But immigrant children can’t access that right if they are detained waiting for their asylum hearings, except in a few family detention centers," said Stephen W. Yale-Loehr, an immigration law professor at Cornell Law School. If caravan members get into the United States and receive emergency medical care, go to public school and get free school lunch, it wouldn’t necessarily be because Democrats "sign them up," it would be because it’s permitted under law. If they eventually obtain U.S. citizenship, they’d be allowed to vote. Our ruling Trump said, "The Democrats want to invite caravan after caravan of illegal aliens into our country. And they want to sign them up for free health care, free welfare, free education, and for the right to vote." A top Democrat said immigrants should be allowed go through the asylum application process, which is available under law. But it’s a stretch for Trump to say that’s an invitation for caravans to come to the United States. Immigrants granted asylum become eligible for Medicaid and other forms of government assistance. Immigrants in the country illegally can receive emergency medical care and limited access to programs, such as free school lunch and free public education. That wouldn’t be because Democrats "want to sign them up," but because it’s allowed by law. Trump’s claim also falsely implies Democrats want to rush caravan members in to vote in the midterm elections. Trump’s claim is inaccurate and a distortion of the facts. We rate it False.

pomt-06914	Says the state budget "doubled property tax credits for seniors and middle class New Jerseyans" and had "no tax increases for any New Jersey family for the second year in a row."	half-true	/new-jersey/statements/2011/jul/24/chris-christie/gov-chris-christie-says-new-jersey-budget-doubled-/	Gov. Chris Christie recently took the budget battle to the airwaves, touting his $29.7 billion spending plan for fiscal year 2012 as a model of fiscal responsibility. In a radio spot sponsored by the New Jersey Republican State Committee, Christie said the budget "doubled property tax credits for seniors and middle class New Jerseyans" and included "no tax increases for any New Jersey family for the second year in a row." PolitiFact New Jersey found that the new budget is projected to double the average Homestead property tax credit. The question of tax increases is not as clear-cut, however: the state’s major tax rates have stayed the same, but tax credit programs, including Homestead, were reduced last year. First, let’s tackle the Homestead credits. The governor’s office did not respond to multiple requests for comment. A Republican Party spokesman cited the Homestead program to back up the governor’s claim. According to a budget analysis by the state’s nonpartisan Office of Legislative Services, Christie is right that Homestead credits are set to double under the state budget for fiscal 2012. The fiscal 2012 budget increased funding for the Homestead program from $268.2 million in fiscal 2011 to $458 million. According to OLS, the "$189.8 million funding increase is slated to pay for a doubling in (fiscal) 2012 of homestead credits beneficiaries received in (fiscal) 2011." The analysis, citing estimates from the governor’s office, said the average credit for 938,500 homeowners would increase to $476 in fiscal 2012 from $238 in fiscal 2011, when credits were cut significantly. So, Christie technically doubled credits in fiscal 2012. However, the average Homestead benefit would still be less than half of the $1,035 average in fiscal 2010, according to OLS estimates. Also, in fiscal 2012, Christie is maintaining the eligibility requirements for homeowners set by his predecessor -- up to $150,000 in income for senior and disabled homeowners and up to $75,000 in income for all other homeowners. But the fiscal 2011 reduction in the Homestead credits work against the governor’s argument that there have been no tax increases for two consecutive years. It is true that the rates for the state’s three major taxes -- gross income, sales and corporation business -- have not increased under Christie. But it’s also true that the state has reduced funding for some tax credits, which could leave people with less money to offset their tax bills. Between fiscal 2010 and fiscal 2011, the state reduced funding for the Homestead and senior freeze programs as well as the State Earned Income Tax Credit. Individuals can receive the earned income tax credits even if they don’t owe taxes. Senior freeze provides additional property tax relief for senior citizens and the disabled. Four experts with different political persuasions and a Rutgers University professor told us that cutting one or all of those payments could be considered tax increases. Josh Barro, a fellow at the right-leaning Manhattan Institute, said a reduction in the earned income tax credit was not a tax hike, because it’s a welfare payment through the tax code. But reducing the property tax credits could be considered tax increases, since they’re meant to offset property tax burdens, Barro said. Curtis Dubay, a senior policy analyst at the conservative Heritage Foundation, said a reduction in the earned income tax credit could force a recipient to pay more taxes if his credit still falls short. For example, an individual may owe $1,000 in income taxes and then receive a credit for $800, but still owe $200 in taxes, Dubay said. But Alan Berube of the centrist-to-liberal Brookings Institution’s Metropolitan Policy Program said in an email that a reduction would affect earned income tax credit recipients with no remaining income tax liability. "For all, it will increase their total tax bill when you consider all state and local taxes together (i.e, not just income taxes)," he wrote. Andrew Pratt, a spokesman for the state Treasury Department, argued in a series of emails that the earned income tax credit is just a payment to low-income individuals, not a tax break. Pratt pointed out that nearly 75 percent of recipients in 2010 did not owe income taxes. Individuals don’t have to file income tax returns if they earn less than $10,000 annually for single filers or less than $20,000 for married couples filing jointly. Pratt added, "The Senior Freeze and Homestead credits are payments from the Treasury. You cannot classify a reduction or a freeze in the payment or eligibility as a tax increase, unless you are doing so to score political points." Let’s recap: Christie said in a radio ad that the fiscal 2012 budget doubles property tax credits and includes no tax increases for the second consecutive year. The governor’s right about the property tax credits being doubled, even though they’ll remain below the fiscal 2010 average. It’s true that the rates for the state’s three major taxes have remained the same. But three tax credit programs were reduced in fiscal 2011, and several experts said at least one of those reductions could represent a tax hike. We rate the statement Half True.

pomt-04489	Says 50 million people would lose their health insurance if Obamacare is repealed.	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/oct/05/barack-obama/obama-says-50-million-lose-coverage-if-obamacare-r/	Both President Barack Obama and Republican Mitt Romney say they want more Americans to have affordable health insurance. That’s about where their agreement ends. In the first debate of the general election, the candidates sparred about how best to improve the health care system, with Romney calling for a repeal of Obamacare, and Obama defending the reform law. "Gov. Romney says we should replace (Obamacare)... But the problem is, he hasn't described what exactly we'd replace it with, other than saying we're going to leave it to the states," Obama said. "But the fact of the matter is that some of the prescriptions that he's offered, like letting you buy insurance across state lines, there's no indication that that somehow is going to help somebody who's got a pre-existing condition be able to finally buy insurance. In fact, it's estimated that by repealing Obamacare, you're looking at 50 million people losing health insurance." It’s that last line that grabbed our attention: 50 million people losing their health coverage if Obamacare is repealed. We decided to check it out. The two plans Obama’s health care law seeks health coverage for every American by requiring most Americans to obtain coverage or face a fine. To help people meet that requirement, it expands Medicaid for the poor, provides subsidies for people of modest means to buy insurance and requires businesses to provide employee insurance. It also creates exchanges where individuals and businesses can purchase private policies. Government analysts predict that as the law is implemented, the number of uninsured Americans will decline. Opponents argue that it imposes new taxes on families and businesses and could discourage hiring. Romney has pledged to repeal the law. He has offered a general outline of what he would replace it with, though with few specifics. His campaign website says he will limit requirements on private insurance and Medicaid, encourage "flexibility" in the market and convert Medicaid to a block grant program administered by the states. In speeches, he has also said he would provide an income tax deduction for the cost of purchasing insurance. The projections If Romney wins the election and acts to repeal Obamacare on Day 1, there is no accounting that shows 50 million people losing their insurance right away. Obama didn’t say so, but his statement referred to projections out to 2022. That said, the Congressional Budget Office predicts that Obamacare will reduce the number of uninsured. Without the law, the CBO says there will be a total of 60 million uninsured Americans by 2022. With the law, that number will be only 30 million. So if Obamacare is repealed, that’s 30 million people without insurance as a result. The remainder of Obama’s 50-million number originates with a study gauging the impact of Romney’s plan. Edwin Park, vice president for health policy at the left-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, said Romney has suggested converting Medicaid, the health program for the poor, to block grants, with a cap on federal funding of inflation plus 1 percentage point. That’s similar to the budget proposed by vice presidential nominee Paul Ryan, versions of which passed the House this year and last. (We should note that any move to turn Medicaid into a block grant would require new legislation passed by Congress.) Both proposals, Park said, fall short of Medicaid’s current growth rate. "We’re talking a big gap between what Medicaid would be scheduled to grow at vs. what it would be under the block grant," Park said. The Ryan budget, he said, cuts $810 billion from the program over 10 years. (Campaign finance records show that Park has donated $350 to the Obama campaign.) The Urban Institute, a think tank that studies health policy and social programs, determined that the cuts will force states to tighten eligibility for the program, leading to between 14 million and 27 million people being dropped. Another study, written for the liberal organization FamiliesUSA, also concluded that Romney’s plan for Medicaid would end up pushing people out of the program. To estimate how many, author Jonathan Gruber, who was an architect of both Romney’s health plan in Massachusetts and of Obamacare, said he assumed in the study that states would find a way to absorb 25 percent of the cuts (by becoming more efficient, cutting down on overhead, etc.) but that the rest would have to be made up by tightening eligibility and dropping Medicaid recipients. He found that by 2022, 18 million more people would be uninsured. In a second study, Gruber assumed greater savings by the states -- 50 percent -- in absorbing the Medicaid cuts before dropping people, and determined that 12 million more people would lack health insurance. "The bottom line is it depends on assumptions you make, but no matter what you do it’s going to be a huge difference in the number of uninsured," Gruber said. The counter arguments Yuval Levin, a fellow at the conservative Ethics and Public Policy Center, said the studies fail to account for the Medicare cuts, tax increases, and increased premium costs in Obamacare, "and so presents a description of the law’s effects on the health care system that is badly skewed." With Medicaid, Levin said it’s "high implausible" that states would drop people upon implementing the block grant, which will also create unaccounted for savings. "This all leads them to the implausible conclusion that Romney’s extensive efforts to expand insurance coverage (through purchasing pools, the transformation of the tax treatment of coverage, purchasing across state lines, co-insurance, expanded health savings accounts, protections for people with pre-existing conditions, etc.) would result in less rather than more coverage," Levin said. (Campaign records show he donated $2,467 to the Romney campaign and $200 to the Republican National Committee.) Joseph Antos, a scholar with the conservative American Enterprise Institute, said he found flaws with the assumptions about Obamacare’s impact. "FamiliesUSA assumes that all states fully expand Medicaid, despite the Supreme Court ruling that they cannot be penalized by losing all federal funds if they do not do it. Obviously, the poorer states won’t expand in that case—that 100 percent fed funding disappears in a few years, and the states then begin paying, and many haven’t figured out how to cover teachers pensions yet," Antos said in an email. "They also assume that states will fully implement the exchanges on time. That is also not going to happen. Some will, some won’t." "Conclusion: far fewer than 32.9 million will be covered by Obamacare." Our ruling Obama said in the debate that by repealing Obamacare, "you're looking at 50 million people losing health insurance." He didn’t say so, but that figure is based on projections for a decade down the road, and it applies to people who don't have insurance now. If Romney repeals the health care law, some of those people will not have actually gotten coverage. And, only about 30 million to 32.9 million people would lose coverage by 2022 if Obamacare was simply repealed. An additional 18 million people might lose coverage if Romney achieves his plan of converting Medicaid to a block grant, according to some studies. Obama’s number assumes the worst about the possible effect of Romney’s plan, whose stated purpose is to get more people covered. And some critics say the promise of Obamacare is inflated -- that not so many people will gain coverage, therefore not so many would lose it if the law is repealed. Obama is right that repealing the health care law will result in millions losing coverage, but his statement is an oversimplification of long-term projections and includes more than just a simple repeal of the 2010 law. On balance, we rate Obama’s statement Mostly False.	None	Barack Obama	None	None	None	2012-10-05T17:47:47	2012-10-03	['None']
pomt-04225	The "error rates" for the Fulton County elections department are "well below the average."	false	/georgia/statements/2012/nov/26/emma-darnell/no-evidence-found-back-fulton-commissioners-claim/	Fulton County election officials have been the subject of much scrutiny from state officials and some news outlets for problems many voters had at the polls on Election Day. Annoyed by the criticism, County Commissioner Emma Darnell defended the staff at a recent meeting. "I did some checking on my own to see what are the error rates for elections departments as large as this one. You’re well below the average," Darnell said during the County Commission’s meeting Nov. 7. PolitiFact Georgia was curious to determine whether Fulton’s error rates were below average, but we encountered a roadblock. Darnell said she respects the work of PolitiFact Georgia but wouldn’t discuss anything related to the election department. She complained about biased media coverage on the subject, particularly by The Atlanta Journal-Constitution. The commissioner did suggest we examine Fulton and compare it with other Georgia counties. Since Fulton is Georgia’s highest-populated county, we also thought a fair comparison would be to examine Fulton against other counties across the nation with similar populations. Without knowing exactly what the commissioner meant by "error rates," we sought ways to examine mistakes by election officials at the polls. In Georgia, most voters cast their ballots on touch screens that are recorded on cards. Other states use other methods to record votes, so there is not a uniform way to measure errors. One uniform method to count votes, though, is provisional ballots, which appeared to be a problem for Fulton on Election Day. The greatest complaint about Fulton came from people who said they were told their names weren’t on the county’s voter rolls. In such cases, the person is given a provisional ballot and the county then works to verify that person is registered to vote. According to the Georgia Secretary of State’s Office, 9,575 provisional ballots were cast on Nov. 6 in Fulton. That was more than twice the total of provisional ballots cast in Cobb, DeKalb and Gwinnett counties combined, state data show. More than 100 people who tried to vote in Fulton have filed complaints to the state about the Nov. 6 election, the AJC reported. Fulton elections officials were still printing and delivering supplemental voter lists to precincts hours after the polls opened, the AJC has reported. Georgia Secretary of State Brian Kemp called the situation a "debacle." Fulton officials have made some mistakes in recent years administering elections. In 2008, the county sent absentee ballots late to as many as 2,500 voters, the AJC reported at the time. The result: Some voters were unable to cast ballots in that year’s presidential election. In April 2009, state records show some Fulton election workers tossed thousands of voter registration cards in a Dumpster, violating proper procedure. They also failed to retain absentee ballot applications. The State Elections Board ordered Fulton to pay a $120,000 fine, plus costs associated with an investigation, a remedial plan and other penalties. Nearly 400,000 people voted in Fulton in the November 2012 general election, according to the Georgia secretary of state’s website. The county has 567,174 registered voters, state records show. Charles Stewart III, a political science professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, used 2008 federal elections data to compare the percentage of provisional ballots used by Fulton and nearly three dozen other U.S. counties with 400,000 to 800,000 voters. Other experts on elections also suggested we contact Stewart. In 2008, slightly more than 400,000 Fulton residents voted in the presidential election. About 4,100 ballots were cast using provisional ballots. That’s a 1 percent rate, which was about average among those 35 counties, Stewart said. Fulton’s 1 percent was twice as high as that in Cobb, DeKalb and Gwinnett counties. There were nine smaller Georgia counties with a higher percentage of provisional ballots than Fulton, Stewart found. Those provisional ballots still needed to be checked to determine whether the vote should be counted. Nearly 1,500 of those provisional ballots in Fulton were rejected, Stewart said, which amounts to an acceptance rate of nearly 64 percent. The average acceptance rate for U.S. counties similar to Fulton was about the same, Stewart said. Stewart looked at the number of provisional ballots cast in Fulton in the Nov. 6 election and compared it with all the people who voted. "If there are 11,000 provisional ballots this year out of 400,000 cast, that’s a 2.8 percent rate, which is quite a bit higher than 2008," Stewart said. Let’s recap. Fulton Commissioner Emma Darnell said the number of errors by the county’s elections staff was "well below the average." She declined to provide details to back up her claim. Research shows Fulton was in the middle among U.S. counties of comparable size when it came to provisional ballots rejected in 2008, the last presidential election. That year, twice as many provisional ballots were cast in Fulton than there were in some of Georgia’s largest counties. From the evidence available, the county’s recent history and the high number of provisional ballots cast in this month’s election, there’s not much evidence to back up Darnell’s claim that Fulton was "well below the average." We rate her claim False.	None	Emma Darnell	None	None	None	2012-11-26T06:00:00	2012-11-07	['None']
pomt-05641	Says "we got a chance to pass what I think is Oregon's first human trafficking bill which has increased by 66 percent the calls to the human trafficking hotline."	mostly false	/oregon/statements/2012/mar/22/jefferson-smith/did-human-trafficking-bill-lead-dozens-hotline-cal/	Last November Portland mayoral candidate and state Rep. Jefferson Smith sat down with Portland Monthly magazine to talk about his candidacy and the future of the city. He opened the discussion with a list of some of his legislative accomplishments, including this one: "We got a chance to pass what I think is Oregon's first human trafficking bill, which has increased by 66 percent the calls to the human trafficking hotline." Smith was referencing a bill that passed in the February 2010 special session. Essentially the law asked the Oregon Liquor Control Commission to send out a letter highlighting the issue of human trafficking with each license renewal notice. The letter included a sticker that bar owners and others could post directing people to a hotline run by the National Human Trafficking Resource Center. The bill was a start, but we wondered if it really had the effect of increasing calls to the hotline by 66 percent. We called the OLCC first to get a handle on just how the law ended up playing out. Spokeswoman Joy Spencer told us the organization sent notices to just over 10,000 licensees between April 2010 and March 2011. The program has since ended. Next, we checked with the hotline to see how Smith’s numbers panned out. Thankfully, the Polaris Project, which runs the hotline, made this pretty easy for us. The project publishes yearly statistics on the hotline, which has been up and running since 2007. The statistics are incredibly comprehensive. They show where the calls are coming from -- down to the county level -- along with the caller’s language, profession if disclosed, and the way they learned about the hotline. We did some quick math and found Smith was right. Between 2009 and 2010, the number of calls coming from Oregon increased 66 percent, jumping from 95 to 158. Even more impressively, that trend continued into 2011, when the hotline received 191 calls. That’s a 20 percent increase from the previous year. The figures, though, are always the easy part. Smith was clearly claiming a causation between the increase in the calls and the bill he helped pass. For that, however, there wasn’t much evidence. As Megan Fowler, spokeswoman for the Polaris Project pointed out, the hotline has been seeing the same trend nationwide. Between 2009 and 2010, the number of calls nationally rose from 7,637 to 11,874, a 55 percent increase. In 2011, the number hit 19,427 -- a 63 percent increase. What’s more, if you look at where most people in Oregon found the hotline number, the biggest sources are the Internet or "prior knowledge." Few people came by ways of posters or other materials. A number of callers -- 24 percent in 2010 and 33 percent the following year -- didn’t specify where they got the number. However, that seems to run somewhat counter to Fowler’s experience with Texas where, she said, the Legislature made a law mandating that establishments put up a poster referring people to the hotline. There, she said, a huge number of callers cited "posters" as their informational source. "We definitely encourage actions like" Oregon’s law, Fowler said. "We do see greater success when the bill is a mandatory posting. But I wouldn't want to dissuade people from putting the hotline number out." We called Smith to check in with him on the statement. He immediately said that to draw a direct relationship between the hotline gains and his bill was an overstep on his part. He also pointed out that in more recent references, he’s been more humble in what the bill accomplished. Part of the reason, Smith said, is that since the discussion in November he’s had more time to look at the figures and realized the connection wasn’t as strong as he initially expected. "I don't think that (the quote) accurately reflects the way we typically talk about it." Smith followed up by sending us a few copies of a list of legislative achievements he’s since distributed. Here’s how he usually plays the human trafficking law: "Chief Co-sponsor of the Human Trafficking Hotline bill -- one of Oregon’s first pieces of human trafficking legislation. Chief Co-sponsor of HB 4146, providing for the expungement of sex trafficking victims. Calls from Oregon to the national hotline have reportedly increased by 66-68%." "I try to be very careful not to say ‘because’ -- because I rarely can be confident of ‘because,’" Smith wrote. It’s true that in his more recent statements, Smith doesn’t make an explicitly causal relationship. But even so, it’s implied. That brings us to our ruling. The number of calls to the hotline has increased significantly over the past couple years -- even more so than the 66 percent Smith cites if you consider the 2011 figures. That said, there’s not much evidence that Oregon’s "hotline law" was the driving force. Nationally, the figures are up by about the same degree and most callers don’t report that they found out about the hotline by way of a poster or other such material. We rate this claim Mostly False -- there’s a grain of truth, but it ignores critical facts that would give a different impression.

pomt-15161	"Our companies are moving into Mexico more than almost any other place right now."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/aug/27/donald-trump/trump-says-us-companies-moving-mexico-more-almost-/	Among Donald Trump’s most talked-about immigration policies is his proposal to make Mexico pay for a border wall. Trump laid out the rationale for why Mexico would agree in an interview with CNN’s Chris Cuomo. "You know what, because they make a fortune with us," Trump explained on Aug. 19. "Our companies are moving into Mexico more than almost any other place right now. We are losing our industry. We're losing our business to Mexico." We were curious about Trump’s claim that more U.S. companies are relocating south than almost any other place in the world. (China, anyone?) His campaign didn’t get back to us, but given the context of Trump’s claims, we’ll assume he’s talking about outsourcing production overseas, rather than companies packing up their headquarters and moving abroad for good (a practice known as corporate inversion, which often takes place in the Bahamas). Experts told us there’s no official tally of the number of companies closing plants in the United States and moving production abroad. "Outsourcing is hard to measure," explained Gene Grossman, a professor of international economics at Princeton University. "Only rarely can we see a firm close a plant in one place and open a new one someplace else doing the same thing. So, we use proxies." We’ll look at three different proxies: the amount of imports from other countries, the number of U.S. companies operating in different countries, and the amount of money U.S. companies are investing in firms abroad (known as foreign direct investment). Our southern neighbor doesn’t top the list by any of these metrics, but Trump has a point when he says Mexico is near the top. It’s No. 3 in import value, No. 7 in number of U.S. firms (out of 189 countries), and No. 15 (out of 171 countries) in foreign direct investment. If Trump really wanted to name a country as the top outsourcing destination, experts agreed that it would be China, not Mexico. It’s No. 1 in import value and No. 6 in number of U.S. companies. (Europe dominates foreign direct investment.) "He’s mistaken. More companies are moving to China than Mexico," said Robert Scott, who studies trade at the liberal Economic Policy Institute. "China, in particular, has been a favorite location for many U.S. businesses, often due to the lure of the vast and growing Chinese market," added James Jackson, an international trade analyst for the Congressional Research Service. Much of outsourcing to China is indirect, according to Scott. He pointed to Apple Inc. as a prime example of a U.S. company letting someone else do the manufacturing (their most notable contractor is the controversial company Foxconn). Mexico, however, is certainly competitive and will remain an important outsourcing destination -- thanks to its proximity to the United States and particularly when it comes to making cars and car parts, experts said. While there’s no official tracking, there are plenty of anecdotes of automakers moving south, cited by Trump himself. Yet some experts contend that while his claim has some truth to it, these relocations and outsourcing are not signs of the U.S. "losing" businesses or jobs to Mexico. Rather, these developments are typical of a dynamic economy. "Moving jobs to Mexico has not been the major reason for the decline in manufacturing jobs in the U.S.," said Martin Baily, a senior economics fellow at the Brookings Institution. "Manufacturing jobs as a share of total jobs have been declining in the U.S. for over 50 years, same is true in all other advanced economies." Our ruling Trump said, "Our companies are moving into Mexico more than almost any other place right now." There’s no direct measure of how many companies are moving plants from the United States to Mexico. When we look at outsourcing through official metrics (imports, foreign direct investment, and the number of U.S. business housed in a certain country), Mexico places near the top but not at the top. Experts said China was the top outsourcing destination. Trump used the qualifier "almost," which makes his statement partially accurate, but it still needs additional context and information.

pomt-06826	The debt-ceiling bill "doesn’t cut the debt. It will add about $7 trillion in new debt over the next 10 years."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/aug/08/jim-demint/jim-demint-says-debt-ceiling-bill-wont-actually-cu/	After the agonizingly drawn-out negotiations to raise the federal debt ceiling, Americans may be forgiven for thinking that the enacted legislation will actually result in lower federal debt. But Sen. Jim DeMint, R-S.C., says that such a view is mistaken. "This bill doesn’t cut the debt," DeMint, a leading fiscal conservative, told The State newspaper. "It will add about $7 trillion in new debt over the next 10 years on the backs of our children and grandchildren. This bill doesn’t stop deficit spending. It locks in trillion-dollar spending deficits for years to come." A reader asked us to check DeMint’s claim that the bill "doesn't cut the debt," so we did. In the big picture, we found that the bill does slow the rate of growth in the debt. But we also found that the debt still rockets upward in absolute terms due to a tide of prior spending commitments. But we'll also note that arithmetic is only part of it: DeMint's phrasing is also somewhat off-base. He attributes the increase in the debt over the next 10 years to the bill itself, when, in fact, it is a result of the bill's inaction in curbing spending commitments already set in motion. A fine point, perhaps, but one that we think is worth pointing out. We'll return to this issue in a moment. First, let's take a look at the numbers. Doing so is tougher than it sounds, since budget experts said there is no debt estimate for 2021 that you can simply point to -- you have to estimate it from scratch. With the help of Marc Goldwein, policy director of the centrist Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, we were able to navigate the spreadsheet jungle and put together these calculations, some of which we rounded for simplicity. First, here's our starting point for measuring the debt in 2021 We start with a Congressional Budget Office’s estimate from March -- long before the debt deal was signed -- of the "baseline" for publicly held debt in 2021, in table 1-5 of this CBO document: About $18 trillion. (All the figures we are listing here assume a 10-year extension of the policies listed.) Next, we adjust for other policies that are expected to reduce or increase that debt figure over the next decade • Subtract the approximate savings from the appropriations bill passed in March ($122 billion) plus interest savings (more than $24 billion), listed on the final page of this CBO document: Reduction of about $150 billion, leaving $17.85 trillion. • Subtract savings from the military draw-down in Iraq and Afghanistan, including interest savings, listed in table 1-7 of this CBO document: Reduction of about $1.37 trillion, leaving $16.48 trillion. • Add the cost of extending the George W. Bush tax cuts and adjusting the Alternative Minimum Tax ($3.82 trillion) plus interest ($795 billion), listed in table 1-7 of this CBO document: Addition of $4.62 trillion, making the running total $21.1 trillion. • Add the cost of avoiding scheduled reductions in Medicare physician reimbursements, commonly known as the "Doc Fix" ($298 billion for a 10-year freeze) plus interest ($60 billion), in row one of table 3 of this CBO document: Addition of approximately $360 billion, making the running total -- or how much the debt was expected to grow before the debt deal -- roughly $21.5 trillion. Next, we subtract the 2011 debt DeMint was talking about how the debt would increase over "the next 10 years," which is from 2012 to 2021. Take the running total of $21.5 trillion -- the estimated debt in 2021 -- and subtract the debt for 2011 ($10.4 trillion), as listed in table 1-5 in this CBO document, meaning that the increase in debt from 2012 to the end of 2021 is an estimated $11.1 trillion. Finally, we determine how much the debt deal changed this number Subtract the savings from the debt ceiling deal that are slated to accrue between 2012 and 2021 ($2.12 trillion), leaving roughly $9 trillion. So by this calculation, DeMint actually underestimates the growth in the debt over 10 years -- it could be as much as $9 trillion in additional debt rather than $7 trillion. And that only strengthens DeMint’s point that "this bill doesn’t cut the debt." We should note some caveats with our estimate. Most notably, Congress and the president could decide to cut back more aggressively than the deficit deal requires -- for instance, through a bigger military draw-down or allowing the upper-income Bush tax cuts to expire in 2012. That would reduce the additional debt accrued -- but even if that happens, DeMint still has a nice cushion for his estimate. We should also explain that the cuts envisioned in the debt-ceiling deal are real -- they just won’t make that much of a dent in a debt that’s growing rapidly due to increases in spending on items such as Social Security and Medicare, as well as interest for previously accrued debt. So DeMint’s numbers are actually a cautious estimate -- our math suggests that the debt could continue to grow by as much as $9 trillion. Since the senator’s main point was to warn people that the debt-ceiling deal "doesn’t cut the debt," even his low-ball estimate amply supports his point. However, as we noted, there’s a problem with how DeMint phrased his statement. Technically, the debt that will be added is not a result of the debt ceiling bill itself, as DeMint indicated. The bill didn’t "add about $7 trillion in new debt," as he put it -- instead, it fails to stop that debt from being added. We understood what DeMint’s point was -- and thought it was a valid one -- but at PolitiFact, one of our guiding principles is that "words matter." In this case, DeMint was wrong to say that the debt ceiling bill itself added to the debt, but he was right in his point that, despite passage of the bill, debt will continue to grow. For that reason we rate his statement Mostly False.	None	Jim DeMint	None	None	None	2011-08-08T14:56:16	2011-08-03	['None']

A story from March 21, 2017, carried the headline "2 liberal Democrat congressmen arrested for planning Trump’s assassination." Facebook users flagged it as potentially fake, as part of the site’s efforts to winnow fake news from users’ news feeds. The post said Rep. Harold Spunkmeyer, D-Ill., and Rep. Johnathon Leominster Jr., D-Mass., plotted to ambush Trump during a trip to Florida. The story quoted a federal agent as saying "there was enough evidence when presented to the president for him to order us to take them as terrorism suspects." You don’t have to be from Illinois or Massachusetts to be able to quickly confirm that there are no members of Congress named Harold Spunkmeyer or Johnathon Leominster Jr. There also has been no record of any such arrests of other lawmakers, because the story isn’t real. We emailed ProudLeader.com to see if they knew that, since there’s no disclaimer on the link, but never heard back. We’ve seen the same post pop up on some other websites, but its origins are a familiar source: TheLastLineOfDefense.org, which posted the original story on Feb. 23. The parody website has been the source of several fake news stories that we’ve previously checked. TheLastLineOfDefense.org fabricates posts keyed to topics designed to inflame conservatives. The articles quite often end up being passed around on multiple websites, often without an indication that they are fake. TheLastLineOfDefense.org doesn’t immediately indicate that any of its stories are fake, but its About Us link notes that "all articles should be considered satirical and any and all quotes attributed to actual people complete and total baloney."

pomt-00257	Sen. Joe Manchin "stands with Hillary Clinton and D.C. Dems on gun control, higher taxes, amnesty, and Planned Parenthood."	half-true	/west-virginia/statements/2018/oct/04/patrick-morrisey/fact-checking-patrick-morrisey-positions-held-joe-/	In his battle to unseat U.S. Sen. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., Republican state Attorney General Patrick Morrisey is working hard to paint Manchin as a captive of his party even though West Virginia voters strongly back President Donald Trump. In a tweet on Aug. 31, Morrisey said, "On life, guns, tax cuts, and coal, I stand with President @realDonaldTrump and West Virginia. Meanwhile, lying liberal Joe Manchin stands with Hillary Clinton and DC Dems on gun control, higher taxes, amnesty and Planned Parenthood. The choice could not be more clear. #WVsen." See Figure 2 on PolitiFact.com In this fact-check, we’ll look at whether Morrisey had a point about Manchin’s stances on guns, taxes, immigration and Planned Parenthood. Guns Manchin once received strong support from the National Rifle Association. But that’s not the case any more. In 2004, when Manchin was running for governor, he received an A-plus rating from the NRA and received the group’s endorsement when running for governor. And in 2010 and 2012, when Manchin was running for a U.S. Senate seat, he was endorsed by the NRA and received an A rating. "Joe Manchin is committed to protecting the Right to Keep and Bear Arms guaranteed to all Americans," Chris Cox, chairman of the NRA Political Victory Fund, wrote in 2012. But Manchin’s relations with the NRA soured in 2013 after he and Sen. Pat Toomey, R-Pa., proposed legislation that would have enacted tighter background checks for certain gun purchases. Manchin and Toomey framed the bill as a compromise, but the NRA saw it as the first step down a slippery slope and opposed it. (It never became law.) This year, the NRA gave Manchin a D and said it was airing ads on behalf of Morrisey in the Charleston and Bluefield markets. "Contrary to what Joe Manchin says in West Virginia, he has supported the agenda of Barack Obama and Chuck Schumer by voting in favor of gun control in Washington, D.C.," Cox wrote this year. In an interview on CBS news in March 2018 — in the wake of the school shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla. — Manchin defended his position as "not gun control. It’s gun sense. … This bill of ours, the Manchin-Toomey bill, should be the base bill they work off of." He also has signaled support for banning bump stocks and raising the legal age of purchasing assault rifles. Manchin added that he would not support a ban on AR-15s. When he was asked about the possibility of the ban, he said, "I don’t have any friends that own the gun right now, I don’t know anyone who’s committed a crime with it, so I wouldn’t take their gun away." "Joe Manchin supports protecting West Virginians’ Second Amendment rights," said Manchin spokesman Grant Herring. "Manchin is a lifetime NRA member. Manchin opposed banning assault weapons and sponsored and voted for legislation allowing concealed-carry reciprocity." Taxes The biggest tax vote in recent years came in December 2017, when the Senate considered a bill backed by President Trump and the GOP-controlled House that made major tax cuts and enacted other changes to the tax code. Manchin, like the chamber’s other Democrats, voted against passage, but the bill received enough Republican support to become law. Manchin’s vote against the bill isn’t exactly a vote for "higher taxes" — it was a vote to keep the status quo on taxes — but he did pass up the opportunity to lower taxes for many Americans, so this charge has some validity. Previously, we’ve reported that in 2012, Manchin voted for the "Buffett Rule," which would have imposed a minimum effective tax rate for high-income taxpayers. He also supported legislation offered by the Bowles-Simpson commission, which was an attempt to balance the budget in a way that included tax increases as well as spending cuts. Immigration policy In 2013, Manchin voted in favor of the "Gang of Eight" bill that, among other things, would have set up a path to legal status and an eventual opportunity for citizenship. The "Gang of Eight" refers to a bipartisan group of eight senators — four Democrats and four Republicans — Jeff Flake, R-Ariz., Marco Rubio, R-Fla., Lindsey Graham, R- S.C., and John McCain R-Ariz. It was endorsed by former President Barack Obama. The bill passed the Senate, 68-32, with 14 Republicans joining 54 Democrats and Democratic-caucusing independent senators in voting for it. (The bill did not get a hearing in the House and never became law.) Manchin was one of the Democrats who voted for it. But did it amount to amnesty? As we’ve concluded in the past, defining "amnesty" is tricky. Some view it as blanket permission for undocumented immigrants to remain in the United States, while others view amnesty as any measure that is favorable to any undocumented immigrants, even if it includes a list of tough measures they have to meet. Republicans who supported the legislation, along with most Democrats, argued that the bill did not offer amnesty. At the time, we concluded that the bill did not offer blanket legal residency to unauthorized immigrants. It mandated fines, background checks and waiting periods and was tougher than a 1986 law that was more in line with a traditional definition of "amnesty." "This bill includes numerous punishments for unauthorized immigrants who broke the laws, including paying fines and other legal sanctions," Alex Nowrasteh with the libertarian Cato Institute told PolitiFact in 2013. "If it was amnesty they would be legalized immediately with no punishment, no process. They would just be forgiven and handed a green card." Since then, Manchin has sought to find a middle ground in the Senate. However, facing a tough reelection campaign in a solidly pro-Trump state, he has often emphasized his stance on toughening border security. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com In a press release from February 2018 — after the Senate failed to reach agreement on legislation protecting undocumented immigrants who came to the United States as children, along with new investments in border security — Manchin said, "I share the president's commitment to border security. That’s why I voted for his plan." Herring, his spokesman, added that Manchin "also supports Kate's Law, which would increase penalties for criminals who re-enter the country illegally." Planned Parenthood The national health and family-planning clinic network has been a longtime target of anti-abortion groups because it provides abortion services. By law, federal money cannot be used to pay for abortion services, but federal dollars do flow to Planned Parenthood for other purposes — something that rankles opponents of abortion, who say that money is fungible. We have previously looked at what Manchin has said and done about Planned Parenthood. Critics pointed to photos Manchin took with constituents carrying pro-Planned Parenthood signs, although he has also taken photos with supporters carrying anti-Planned Parenthood signs. Manchin has said that he’s personally anti-abortion but supports federal funding for Planned Parenthood as long as the funding comports with existing federal law. In a statement to PolitiFact, Herring said that Manchin "has always been pro-life. Planned Parenthood doesn’t receive taxpayer money for abortions. The only Planned Parenthood in WV provides basic health care services and screenings, and Sen. Manchin doesn’t want to take away health care from women." Our ruling Morrisey said Manchin "stands with Hillary Clinton and DC Dems on gun control, higher taxes, amnesty, and Planned Parenthood." We’re not entirely sure what Hillary Clinton has to do with this, but Morrisey can point to some evidence to support Manchin’s loyalty to Democratic orthodoxy in each of these four areas. That said, Morrisey glosses over important nuances. On guns and immigration, for instance, Manchin has often worked with Republicans to find common ground, rather than taking a strong Democratic line. On taxes, Manchin did vote against the Trump-backed tax bill, but his position would have left the tax code the same, rather than imposing "higher taxes." And Morrisey ignores Manchin’s personal anti-abortion position in focusing on Manchin’s support for Planned Parenthood; Manchin supports the status quo on federal funding, which is to provide it only for non-abortion services.

pomt-08778	"Over 81 percent of the babies that are born at LBJ Hospital right here in Houston are born of women who are not here legally."	false	/texas/statements/2010/aug/23/debbie-riddle/debbie-riddle-says-more-81-babies-born-houston-hos/	State Rep. Debbie Riddle, R-Tomball, has long expressed concerns about illegal immigration. She sounded that theme anew Aug. 10 during an appearance on CNN, telling host Anderson Cooper that mothers who are illegal residents routinely have babies in the United States to "anchor" their families in this country. "The fact is it is documented," Riddle said. "Over 81 percent of the babies that are born at LBJ Hospital right here in Houston are born of women who are not here legally. It is well-known that women come over here, cross the border in order to have the babies here because once they get here and once that little American citizen is born and becomes an anchor baby — look, I'm a grandmother of 10, I love children, but the fact is this is breaking the back of the taxpayers of Texas and the United States." Eighty-one percent? Documented, well-known? We decided to check Riddle's claim, remembering that PolitiFact recently rated as Half True South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham's statement that people come here to have babies and then leave. While there's ample evidence that many illegal immigrants give birth in the U.S. every year, PolitiFact's research found that the incentive for illegal immigrants to come here is based more on economic hopes than quickie citizenship for U.S.-born babies. Cooper grilled Riddle after she claimed that pregnant women were entering the U.S. as tourists to give birth to their children "with the nefarious purpose of turning them into little terrorists who will then come back to the U.S. and do us harm." Riddle didn't offer Cooper evidence to back up the claim, and when we contacted her, Riddle told us in an e-mail that she shouldn't have talked about the "terror babies," as they've come to be known. "I demand proof when my opponents challenge my viewpoints, and it's reasonable to expect me to do the same," she said. "That doesn't mean the things I said aren't true; it just means that I shouldn't assert them as fact unless I'm prepared to show you the facts." So what are the facts on the babies born at Houston's Lyndon Baines Johnson General Hospital to mothers who are not here legally? Jon English, Riddle's legislative chief of staff, said she based her claim on an opinion article by state Sen. Dan Patrick, R-Houston, published in the April 30 Houston Chronicle. Noting that Texas bears a cost from illegal immigration, Patrick wrote: "In recent years, 81 percent of babies born at the LBJ General Hospital were born to mothers who were here illegally." Patrick's chief of staff, Logan Spence, told us that Patrick heard the 81 percent number from officials at the Harris County Hospital District, which oversees LBJ Hospital. However, six years of delivery data from the district did not confirm that statistic. Melinda Muse, a spokeswoman for the district, told us that Patrick's figure may have also included mothers who are legal immigrants as well as deliveries at Ben Taub General Hospital, the other hospital in the district that delivers babies. In a search of newspaper stories, we found an Aug. 8, 2010, Dallas Morning News article which reported that 82 percent of the births at LBJ and Ben Taub in 2009 were to women who were not U.S. citizens. The article relied on Texas Health and Human Services Commission information derived from an emergency Medicaid program that reimburses hospitals for delivering the babies of poor women who lack U.S. citizenship. But Stephanie Goodman, a spokeswoman for the commission, said that information included births to both legal and illegal immigrants. She said that the state doesn't know how many of the Medicaid mothers were undocumented. We also found a September 2006 Houston Chronicle story on the rising number of undocumented immigrants from Mexico and Central America coming to South Texas to give birth. The article quoted Shannon Rasp, then a spokeswoman for the hospital district, as saying that "using anecdotal information provided us by our staff, statistics from other public hospital systems and our patient demographics, we believe that approximately 70 to 80 percent of our obstetrics patients are undocumented." The best information we found to assess Riddle's statement was the district's six years of delivery data. A caveat: Delivery statistics refer to the number of women who give birth, not the number of babies born, which Riddle and Patrick were talking about. Deliveries of multiple children, like twins and triplets, mean that there are more babies than mothers in any given year. About 85 percent of the 8,974 deliveries at Ben Taub and LBJ in fiscal 2010 — March 1, 2009, to Feb. 28, 2010 — were to noncitizens, which include both legal and illegal immigrants. Forty percent of those were at LBJ. Of those, 2,418 were to undocumented mothers. That means that in fiscal 2010, 63 percent of total deliveries (3,818) at LBJ hospital were to undocumented immigrants. For fiscal 2009, that figure is 59 percent. Previous years saw higher percentages — 71 percent in 2008, 73 percent in 2007, 70 percent in 2006 and 69 percent in 2005. Remember, those statistics are for mothers only. When we asked the hospital district for data that links babies born at LBJ with the immigration status of their mothers, Muse said the district doesn't keep that information. "Since all babies who are born in the hospital are American citizens, we don't link them to either documented immigrant or undocumented immigrant mothers," Muse said. That means it is unlikely that Patrick accurately cited how many babies were born to undocumented immigrants because the hospital district doesn't have those figures. And Riddle was relying on Patrick's newspaper column when she made her claim. In an e-mail, Patrick told us that if he was off "by a few percentage points, the big picture is still the same. The fact that the number ranges from 58 to 72 percent over the last several years at LBJ reinforces my message that the state of Texas cannot control its economic or cultural destiny until the border is secured." Close but no cigar? According to the latest statistics at LBJ hospital, the proportion of deliveries to illegal immigrant mothers was 63 percent, not 81 percent. The average over the past six years: 68 percent. If Riddle had said those deliveries constitute a clear majority, she'd be on solid ground. But that's not the claim she made on national TV. As PolitiFact has noted before, numbers matter — and when it comes to issues as fractious as immigration and so-called "terror babies," politicians have an obligation to be scrupulously accurate. We rate her statement as False.	None	Debbie Riddle	None	None	None	2010-08-23T06:00:00	2010-08-10	['Houston']
pomt-07924	"Last year, out of the 500,000 (in) population growth we had in the state of Texas, about 250,000 of the 500,000 came to Texas... from the other 49 states."	half-true	/texas/statements/2011/jan/29/david-dewhurst/david-dewhurst-says-last-year-250000-people-moved-/	Texas is a bastion of opportunity that attracts newcomers, Lt. Gov. David Dewhurst said in his Jan. 18 inaugural address. "Last year, out of the 500,000 (in) population growth we had in the state of Texas, about 250,000 of the 500,000 came to Texas, voted for Texas, with their feet," Dewhurst said. "They came from the other 49 states--and it wasn’t because of our weather." That was more dramatic than his prepared remarks, which read: "Last year, more than 200,000 people moved to Texas from the other 49 states." Either way, that’s a lot of volunteer Texans. We zeroed in on what Dewhurst actually speechified. Asked for back-up information, Dewhurst spokesman Mike Walz pointed us to the state demographer, Lloyd Potter of San Antonio. Potter said there are no published figures yet on the state’s population gains in 2010 due to migration from other states. However, Potter singled out a U.S. Census Bureau estimate covering July 2008-July 2009, which says the population of Texas increased by 478,012, or 2 percent, to 24.8 million over those 12 months. During the period, net migration from other states--the number of people who moved to Texas minus those who left Texas for other states--was 143,423. The net migration of residents who moved to Texas from outside the U.S. was 88,116. That is, the state’s population increased by nearly 480,000 with the 143,423 new residents hailing from other states accounting for about 30 percent of the increase. At the bureau, Dallas spokeswoman Suzee Privett guided us to a different collection of data estimating new Texans. According to the bureau’s 2009 American Community Survey, Texas enjoyed a net gain of 128,137 residents coming from other states in 2009. Robert Bernstein, a Maryland-based bureau spokesman, said the two census estimates differ because they cover different time periods--July 2008-July 2009 compared to calendar year 2009--and use different data-gathering approaches. The former estimate draws on government records including birth and death certificates, he said, while the survey is based on samplings of households across the country. Potter said it’s possible that Dewhurst’s reference to 250,000 people moving here from other states included those from other countries, which is a common misunderstanding. We shared the 2009 estimates with Walz. He replied by e-mail that Dewhurst was trying to show that roughly half of the state’s population growth is from migration, with the other half due to natural increases, in-state births minus deaths. But we’re left weighing what Dewhurst actually said: that half the growth Texas experienced -- 250,000 out of 500,000 additional residents last year, he said -- was due to residents moving in from other states. Not quite. First, the census data for 2010 hasn’t been released yet. And the most generous census estimate prior to last year indicates net migration from other states equaled 143,000 people from July 2008 to July 2009, accounting for less than a third of the state’s population increase in the period. However, looking at Texas population growth in terms of people moving here "with their feet" versus people born here, Dewhurst pegged the ratio correctly -- about half-and-half. We rate his claim Half True.	None	David Dewhurst	None	None	None	2011-01-29T06:00:00	2011-01-18	['Texas']
pomt-11076	Says Sen. Tim Kaine "approves of and even applauds his son's participation in a known terrorist organization, #Antifa."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2018/jun/20/corey-stewart/corey-stewarts-comments-sen-tim-kaine-and-antifa/	Corey Stewart, the Republican candidate for U.S. Senate in Virginia, promised a ruthless campaign against incumbent Sen. Tim Kaine. A day after securing his party’s nomination, he tweeted one of his first attacks. "Virginia's sitting senator approves of and even applauds his son's participation in a known terrorist organization, #Antifa," Stewart wrote June 13, 2018. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com Kaine’s son, Linwood Michael "Woody" Kaine, has indeed attended protests affiliated with Antifa, a far-left collection of autonomous anti-fascist groups that are spread throughout the country and share several causes, including the resistance of white supremacist movements. Because Antifa is an umbrella term for many different groups, it does not have an official website or membership. When asked for evidence to support the tweet, Stewart campaign spokesman Noel Fritsch pointed to an article in The Federalist, a conservative website, about Woody Kaine’s arrest for counter-protesting at a pro-Donald Trump rally held in the state Capitol in Minnesota on March 4, 2017. According to local reports, Woody Kaine was one of six counter-protesters arrested by St. Paul Police. He was part of a group of approximately 100 counter-protestors, some of whom set off smoke bombs and fireworks inside the building. Witnesses reported seeing Antifa flags in the crowd of counter-protestors. Though peaceful during the rally, police said the younger Kaine tried to run when approached by an officer and that he had to be restrained. A judge sentenced him to a year of probation and ordered him to pay $236 in fines and fees for resisting arrest. Other counter-protestors were charged with felonies for using tear gas. "While some were charged for disruptive activity at the rally, Woody behaved peacefully there and faced no such charges," said Kaine spokeswoman Miryam Lipper after the sentencing. "He has pled guilty to a misdemeanor in connection with actions during an arrest after leaving the rally." Fritsch said another statement issued jointly by the senator and his wife shortly after the arrest showed that Kaine approves of his son’s Antifa participation. "We love that our three children have their own views and concerns about current political issues," the couple said via a spokesperson. "They fully understand the responsibility to express those concerns peacefully." But elsewhere, Kaine has been more forceful in his condemnation of non-peaceful protests. In a Sept. 8, 2017, letter sent to constituents inquiring about Antifa, Kaine wrote, "I condemn all violence at any political demonstration, including any violent activities by members of Antifa." (We obtained a copy of the letter from Ian Sams, communications director for Kaine’s re-election campaign). "I have spent my whole life fighting for people and causes I care about, but always peacefully," Kaine said. "Whether in the form of civil discourse or peaceful protest, Americans should continue to have frank discussions with each other and with their leaders." Sams noted that Kaine also expressed his preference for civil discourse in an op-ed published to CNN. "We must always balance that popular activism with a requirement to be peaceful — violence has no place in civic discussion," he wrote. "We cannot tolerate violence by anyone, of any political viewpoint, if we truly embrace the principles expressed in the Constitution." "Peacefully protesting at a rally does not equate to being a member of Antifa," Sams said. For the record, characterizations differ as to whether Antifa qualifies as "a known terrorist organization." According to a 2017 Politico report, the Department of Homeland Security formally classified Antifa activities as "domestic terrorist violence" in 2016. The Southern Poverty Law Center, by contrast, does not recognize Antifa as a hate group because "antifa groups do not promote hatred based on race, religion, ethnicity, sexual orientation or gender identity," even if it does display a "propensity for violence." It is also worth noting that the image Stewart quote-tweeted was doctored to show Kaine presenting before Congress with a poster board of his son’s face. (A hammer and sickle is plastered in the top corner.) In the real photo, Kaine was presenting beside a poster-sized image of a Trump tweet. Sams noted that this is not the first misleading image Stewart has shared in support of the same claim. In August 2017, Stewart tweeted a photo of Antifa — and said Kaine’s son was pictured — that had previously appeared in a Swedish blog more than a year before the Minnesota rally. This was also not Stewart's first misleading tweet related to Kaine's son. In May 2018, for example, he tweeted that Woody Kaine "attacked elderly people entering a Trump rally." Our ruling Kaine has encouraged his son and others to peacefully express their political views. But Stewart’s statement that Kaine "approves of and even applauds his son’s participation in a known terrorist organization" implied that Kaine has indicated he would be okay with his son’s participation in the violence at Antifa protests, as well. Kaine’s statements tell a different story — namely, that he approves of his son’s Antifa-related protests only when they are peaceful. Kaine has more than once advocated for peaceful protest, and he has also condemned the violence that has driven some to label Antifa as a terrorist group. We rate Stewart’s statement Mostly False.

pomt-00793	"You know how many children in the history of the United States have died in a fire (at school)? Zero."	false	/florida/statements/2015/apr/06/greg-steube/debate-school-gun-bill-legislator-says-there-have-/	By next school year, some school workers may be allowed to pack heat. A bill that has received approval by some legislative panels would allow superintendents to designate certain K-12 employees to carry concealed firearms. State Rep. Greg Steube, R-Sarasota, a sponsor of the bill, said the measure makes a lot of sense considering school shootings of recent years. Here’s what he said during a Florida House judiciary committee hearing April 2: "Right now our schools are required to do two or three fire drills a year. You know how many children in the history of the United States have died in a fire? Zero. You know how many have died because of a school shooting? Quite a few, but the state doesn’t require them to do any type of training. So this would require them to do, every year two times, school safety training as it relates to active shooters to work out these type of details that need to be worked out." The committee voted in favor of the bill -- as did two other House panels in March. We were alerted to Steube’s statement about the lack of fatal school fires by Associated Press reporter Gary Fineout who tweeted about it. So we decided to check it out. Data on school fires Steube told PolitiFact Florida that he "definitely misspoke" about school fires. "I was talking about Florida," said Steube, who first proposed such legislation in 2013 after the mass shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn. "There has never been in the history of Florida a child who died in a school fire." Steube said the point he was trying to make is that Florida schools are required to do fire drills, but not lockdown drills. (Staff analysis of the bill states that schools must develop procedures for hostage and weapons situations; Steube’s bill inserts language that requires schools to do drills for active shooter/hostage situations.) Some school districts already do lockdown drills including in Broward, Hillsborough, Miami-Dade Pasco and Pinellas counties. We drew information about fatal school fires from the National Fire Protection Association. The association lists school fires with 10 or more deaths. Most of the fires go back to the first half of the 20th century. We will summarize a few of the fires: Consolidated School in New London, Texas: This school fire has the largest number of fatalities documented by the association. A gas explosion in March 18, 1937, led to the deaths of 294 students and teachers at the school which was next to an oil refinery. A teacher turned on a sanding machine in an area filled with a mixture of gas and air, which set off the fire. "Immediately the building seemed to lift in the air and then smashed to the ground. Walls collapsed. The roof fell in and buried its victims in a mass of brick, steel, and concrete debris," states history from a museum that memorializes the fire. Lakeview School in Collinwood, Ohio: A suburban Cleveland elementary school caught fire and killed 173 children and three adults on March 4, 1908. A furnace set fire to wooden supports, and the conflagration quickly spread throughout the building. Our Lady of the Angels school, Chicago: On Dec. 1 , 1958, fire broke out at the foot of a stairway in the school, killing 90 pupils and three nuns. A student smoking might have been the cause. Thankfully, those types of fires are no longer common due to modern safety standards. "In recent years, the very few deaths that do occur in schools tend to be either adults or juvenile firesetters who set a fire in the school," said Marty Ahrens, who works for the association. In recent decades, the association has collected fire data through the federal government’s National Fire Incident Reporting System and its own survey. Between 2007-11, U.S. fire departments responded to an estimated average of 5,690 structure fires in educational properties including day cares, K-12 schools and colleges. These fires caused an annual average of 85 civilian fire injuries and $92 million in direct property damage. In search of fires at schools in Florida Since Steube told us that he meant to say there had been no children who died in fires at Florida schools, we asked state experts if they could recall any. A spokeswoman for the state fire marshal said there were no fire-related fatalities in K-12 schools between 2000 and 2014, which includes all available incidents in the fire marshal’s database. We did find a case of a 4-year-old girl dying in a fire at a day care center in Tallahassee. A malfunctioning fan caused a fire at Stepping Stones child care center in Tallahassee in 2008. The day before the fire, a problem with a bathroom exhaust fan was noted on a repair sheet. A "floater" teacher assigned to the girl and her class that day had not yet been trained on what to do in a fire and was scheduled to be trained that day, the Tallahassee Democrat reported. We also found records of a dormitory fire in 1914 that killed six children and two staff members at the Arthur G. Dozier School for Boys, the infamous reform school in Marianna (although that was a penal institution and not a traditional school). The school’s superintendent and staff were on a "pleasure bent" in town when the fire started. The superintendent was dismissed after facts were presented to a grand jury. The school was shut down in 2011 after a bleak history full of rape, torture and unreported child deaths. Our ruling When talking about a bill to designate certain people in K-12 schools to carry firearms, Steube said "You know how many children in the history of the United States have died in a fire (at school)? Zero." There have been at least eight school fires with 10 or more deaths in the United States, though the most recent one was in 1958, according to a national association that tracks such fatal fires. None on that list were in Florida. Steube admitted that he misspoke -- he meant to say no children died in school fires in Florida. We rate this claim False.

pomt-04773	The state government workforce grew when Tim Kaine was governor.	mostly false	/virginia/statements/2012/aug/27/george-allen/george-allen-says-state-government-workforce-grew-/	Republican Senate candidate George Allen scoffed when his Democratic rival Tim Kaine said in a July debate that he undertook a series of budget cuts as governor. "You talk about budget cuts," Allen said to Kaine during a July 21 debate at Hot Springs. "But Virginia, at the end of your term, had a larger state workforce than at the beginning of your term." Politifact Virginia previously checked a claim from Allen that the state workforce declined substantially while he was governor from 1994 to 1998 and rated it Mostly True. We wondered if it was true that Virginia’s workforce saw a net increase while Kaine was governor. The Allen campaign, on its website, backs Allen’s claim by pointing to U.S. census tables showing the full-time equivalent employment for Virginia’s state government. Those tables show that from March 2006 to March 2010, the number of full-time-equivalents rose from 122,634 to 124,709. But those census tables only look at a state’s employment levels as of March of each year. Kaine was sworn into office on Jan. 14, 2006, and left office on Jan. 15, 2010. So Allen’s campaign is looking at a time period that starts about two months after Kaine was inaugurated and ends two months after Kaine left office. The census numbers also include jobs in the judicial branch of government, over which a governor has limited control. Seeking tallies more closely aligned with Kaine’s tenure and control, we turned to the website for the Virginia Department of Human Resource Management, the agency that keeps tabs on the size of the state workforce. Anne Waring, a DHRM spokeswoman, said the department does not keep records of the workforce size on every single day. But the agency does count the size of the state’s staff as of the last day of every month. As in our previous story about Allen, we examined tallies of full-time equivalent workers in the executive branch, since that’s the part of the bureaucracy employs about 96 of workers and over which the governor has the most control. There are two logical points to start counting. One is to compare the size of the workforce on Dec. 31, 2005 -- two weeks before Kaine took office -- and compare that to Dec. 31, 2009, two weeks before Kaine left office. Between those dates, the total number of full-time-equivalent employees in the executive branch fell from 116,334 to 113,425. That’s a drop of about 2,909, or 2.5 percent. By this measure, Allen’s statement is wrong. But since Kaine was inaugurated in the middle of January, we also looked at figures from Jan. 31, 2006, to Jan. 31, 2010. Between those dates, the number of workers rose from 111,917 to 112,212 -- an increase of 295 employees, or one-fourth of 1 percent. That makes Allen’s statement right, but not by much. One reason the shift in the number of employees is so dramatic is because between the end of December 2005 and the end of January 2006, the number of temporary workers -- those paid on an hourly basis -- fell from 19,579 to 15,060. Waring explained that temporary employees at colleges and universities who were counted in December were on winter break in January and, therefore, not counted as working that month. Finally, we looked the DHRM numbers from March in 2006 and 2010 to see if they showed an increase in state employment that was similar to the census figures cited by Allen for those two months. They did not. The census figures Allen uses show Virginia’s payroll increased by 2,175 employees from March 2006 to March 2010. DHRM data shows a decrease of 828 full-time equivalent workers in the executive branch over the four-year span. Our ruling Allen said the state workforce expanded during Kaine’s governorship. But there are no records that tabulate the number of executive branch employees on the mid-January day when Kaine took office in 2006 and the day he left four years later. Allen backs his claim by using U.S. Census data that only allows a comparison of numbers in March 2006 -- two months after Kaine entered office -- to March 2010 -- two months after Kaine left. The Census data also includes workers in the judicial and legislative branches, over which a governor has limited control. Better information is available from Virginia’s government, which counts the number of state employees at the end of every month. Determining the increase or decrease in the workforce under Kaine depends on when you start counting. If you compare Dec. 31 figures from 2005 to 2009, the executive workforce -- controlled by the governor -- dropped by 2,909 full-time equivalents. The decrease appears largely because of the number of temporary employees on Virginia’s payroll at the close of 2005. If you compare Jan. 31 figures from 2006 to 2010, the state staff increased by 295. Contrary to the Census numbers cited by Allen, state records show that the bureaucracy under the governor’s control shrank by 828 full-time equivalents between March 2006 and March 2010. So Allen’s information does not come from the best source: The state government. Using state numbers, Allen is barely right by one measure and wrong by two others.

pomt-02673	Marriage "decreases the probability of child poverty by 82 percent."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2014/jan/09/marco-rubio/marco-rubio-says-marriage-decreases-probability-ch/	On the 50th anniversary of President Lyndon B. Johnson’s announcement of the War on Poverty, Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., gave a speech at an event titled, "Income Mobility and the American Dream," sponsored by the American Enterprise Institute, a conservative think tank. During the speech, Rubio made a claim about the relationship between marriage and poverty. "Until at least a few decades ago, our economy proved sufficiently dynamic and innovative to replace old jobs with new ones, but that hasn't been happening in recent years," Rubio said. "Social factors also play a major role in denying equal opportunity. The truth is that the greatest tool to lift people, to lift children and families from poverty, is one that decreases the probability of child poverty by 82 percent. But it isn't a government program. It's called marriage." He continued, "Fifty years ago today, when the War on Poverty was launched, 93 percent of children born in the United States were born to married parents. By 2010, that number had plummeted to 60 percent. It shouldn't surprise us that 71 percent of poor families with children are families that are not headed by a married couple." A reader asked us to investigate whether Rubio is correct that marriage "decreases the probability of child poverty by 82 percent." So we did. The claim appears to come from this article by Robert Rector of the conservative Heritage Foundation. Rector wrote, "According to the U.S. Census, the poverty rate for single parents with children in the United States in 2009 was 37.1 percent. The rate for married couples with children was 6.8 percent. Being raised in a married family reduced a child’s probability of living in poverty by about 82 percent." We concur that the Census Bureau data Rector cited -- from this table -- supports Rubio’s point. However, we have a couple of quibbles. First, there’s more recent census data, covering 2011. And second, there’s a bit of a mismatch between what Rubio said and what Rector wrote about. Rector was comparing female-headed single-parent households that include kids to married households that have kids. But Rubio didn’t specify that he was talking only about female-headed households that have kids. About one of every five single-parent households is headed by a man. If you use 2011 data and include single-parent households headed by either sex, the numbers come out a bit differently. The data show that 37.2 percent of single-parent households are in poverty, compared to 10.9 percent for married families with kids. That’s a 71 percent decrease in the likelihood of poverty, rather than 82 percent. In addition, these statistics are calculated by counting all the people, adult or child, living in households that include children, noted Michael Wiseman, a public policy professor at George Washington University. In other words, the numbers Rubio cited don’t speak directly to the likelihood of a child being in poverty, which was how he worded his claim. We should note that some critics have taken issue with the implications of the statistic Rubio cited. Philip N. Cohen, a sociologist at the University of Maryland, wrote on his blog, "By the same logic, (Rubio) should have said, ‘The greatest tool for lifting children and families out of poverty is getting a job, which increases your income by $40,000 per year’ — because the median weekly earnings of full-time, year-round workers is $771 per week, which is $40,000 per year more than people with no jobs earn." Meanwhile, the liberal group Think Progress pointed to a blog post from a few days earlier by the Council on Contemporary Families, a group of academics that study family policy, that said a "nationally representative study of more than 7,000 women found that approximately 64 percent of the single mothers who married were divorced by the time they reached age 35-44. More importantly, single mothers who marry and later divorce are worse off economically than single mothers who never marry." These may be valid points. However, in his comments, Rubio did not suggest that government pursue any specific government policies to directly promote marriage. He also said that being a two-parent family "decreases the probability of child poverty," which sounds to us like a mathematical analysis of the existing data, rather than a suggestion that changing policies to encourage marriage will actually reduce poverty that already exists. For this reason, we are analyzing the mathematics that underlie his comment question, not the conclusions that can, or can’t, be drawn from the statistic. "We take issue much less with the basic numbers than with the implication that marriage per se is what’s driving these differences in poverty," said Arloc Sherman, a senior researcher at the liberal Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. Our ruling Rubio said that marriage "decreases the probability of child poverty by 82 percent." Our research suggests that a more current and more accurate statistic to back up his claim would be a decrease of 71 percent. That’s lower, but not dramatically so. We rate his claim Mostly True.

pomt-01325	Four members of the Rhode Island General Assembly "went to vote in 2010 and were told they had already voted."	false	/rhode-island/statements/2014/oct/26/john-carlevale/john-carlevale-says-four-ri-legislators-were-victi/	In the race for Rhode Island Secretary of State, Republican John Carlevale and Democrat Nellie Gorbea are sharply divided on the state’s voter ID statute, which was passed into law three years ago. Gorbea doesn’t see the need for the statute and questions whether it may be disenfranchising legitimate voters. Carlevale calls it a well-crafted law that is helping to stamp out voter fraud in the Ocean State. During an Oct. 19, 2014 debate on "10 News Conference," Carlevale responded to criticism from Gorbea by trying to illustrate the scope of the problem with fraudulent voting before the legislature, in 2011, passed the controversial law, which requires voters to show photo identification. "Let’s talk about the four members of the General Assembly who went to vote in 2010 and were told they already voted," Carlevale said (at the 5:40 mark in the video). "They were disenfranchised." That caught our attention. If four state legislators were victims of voter impersonation in a single election, that would indicate voter fraud would have been pretty widespread. We called Carlevale who told us that the legislators testified about their first-hand experience with voter impersonation when the ID bill was being debated at the State House. But he said he could remember the name of only one of the legislators: Rep. Anastasia P. Williams, a Providence Democrat. He said she would probably recall the other names and recommended we call her. We tried to contact her repeatedly by phone and by email but couldn’t reach her. We checked news reports on the 2011 legislative session and found references in several Journal stories to an allegation made by Williams that she was a victim of voter fraud in 2006. No details were included in those initial stories. In a subsequent PolitiFact Rhode Island item on voter fraud, Williams provided more details, saying that "she and her daughter went to their polling place in 2006, only to discover that two other people had used their names." She spoke about her claim again in interviews in 2012 with reporters for The New Republic and The Providence Phoenix. According to The New Republic story, Williams said that "in 2006 her vote was stolen by an illegal alien who was promised a passport by a state official." A more detailed account was included in the Phoenix story. (Additionally, according to the New Republic story, "during the 2010 elections, [Williams] says she saw a Hispanic man vote twice at the same polling place, wearing a different outfit each time. "What caught my eye was [he] was a hottie," she told the reporter.) Williams never filed a complaint with the Board of Elections about any alleged instance of fraud. The only other legislator named in news reports who spoke of specific cases of voter fraud was Sen. Harold Metts, who sponsored the ID bill in the Senate. According to those stories, Metts said that over the course of 20 years, constituents had told him about fraudulent voting practices at the polls, including one occasion when a man identified himself but couldn’t spell his own name correctly. Metts, however, never said that he had been a victim himself. When we called him, he confirmed that was the case. He also could not recall any members of the General Assembly apart from Williams who said they had been impersonated at the polls. (The Phoenix story on voter fraud also included anecdotes from Sen. William Walaska and Rep. J. Patrick O’Neill in which they alleged voting irregularities, but not impersonation.) We checked recordings of the debates on the House and Senate floor before the ID bill was passed. In the House session, Williams said that she and her daughter had been victims of voter fraud without offering further details. She also made reference to seeing two men each vote twice in one election. Then-Rep. Leo Medina implied that people voted illegally in an election he lost in 2004, but nobody else talked of being impersonated at the polls. In the Senate session, Metts recounted anecdotes of fraud from constituents and repeated the claim Williams made about being impersonated, but no senators said that they had been victims of fraud. We called Robert Kando, executive director of the Rhode Island Board of Elections, who said that in the nine years that he has been at the board there has never been a confirmed case in which one voter has tried to impersonate another. Robert Rapoza, the board’s elections director, said that he has not come across a confirmed case in his 17 years at the board. Kando said that Anastasia Williams was the only legislator he could recall who alleged being a victim of voter fraud during the 2011 debate about the ID bill. He confirmed that she never filed a complaint. A database compiled by students at Arizona State University of voter fraud cases across the nation between 2002 and 2012 found only five complaints in Rhode Island. None involved voter impersonation. In addition, Justin Levitt, a professor at Loyola University Law School who tracks voter impersonation cases, has found only 44 credible cases around the country since 2000. None were in Rhode Island. When we shared what we found with Carlevale, he said: "There was a report that I read somewhere, that there were two or three additional members of the General Assembly who had a similar experience to Anastasia [Williams.]" But he said he couldn’t immediately locate it. Our ruling John Carlevale said that four members of the Rhode Island General Assembly "went to vote in 2010 and were told they had already voted." Carlevale’s statement, which he’s made in at least one other debate, is dramatic and specific. He’s saying that on multiple occasions in one election people impersonated legislators at the polls. The claim hints at a wider problem. Legislators are presumably well-known and recognizable in their districts. If their votes were stolen, then many others must have been too. But we could find only one legislator who made a public claim along those lines: Rep. Anastasia Williams, who says she was impersonated at the polls -- in 2006. She never filed a complaint. We rule Carlevale’s statement False. (If you have a claim you’d like PolitiFact Rhode Island to check, e-mail us at politifact@providencejournal.com. And follow us on Twitter: @politifactri.)

pomt-09618	"A number of the national publications have put this race in a tossup race between Democrats and Republicans. They don't know who's going to win this race."	mostly false	/florida/statements/2010/jan/12/kendrick-meek/fla-democrat-calls-us-senate-race-toss-/	With Republicans Charlie Crist and Marco Rubio dominating news coverage about Florida's U.S. Senate race, Democratic U.S. Rep. Kendrick Meek would like you to know he's running, too. "A number of the national publications have put this race in a tossup race between Democrats and Republicans," Meek said in an interview with Bay News 9 and the St. Petersburg Times that aired Jan. 10, 2010. "They don't know who's going to win this race." Meek, a Miami congressman serving his fourth term, is seeking the Senate seat originally held by Sen. Mel Martinez and now held by Sen. George LeMieux, both Republicans. Meek is facing former Miami Mayor Maurice Ferre in the Democratic primary. Crist, the Florida governor, and Rubio, former speaker of Florida's House, are among the Republican candidates. When it comes to November, are national prognosticators putting Democrats like Meek on equal footing with the GOP? Congressional Quarterly's map lists Florida as "Likely Republican." Stuart Rothenberg, an oft-quoted political analyst, currently has Florida's Senate race as "Clear advantage for incumbent party," or in this case Republicans. Another familiar name in political speculating, the Cook Political Report, lists the Florida race as "Likely Republican." Larry Sabato at the Center for Politics: "Likely Republican." Ken Rudin at National Public Radio: "Republican favored." A group called Intrade says Republicans have a 78.45 percent chance to keep their Florida Senate seat. New York Times: "Likely Republican." At the Washington Post, The Fix's Chris Cillizza does not list Florida among his 10 Senate seats most likely to switch parties. At FiveThirtyEight.com, Florida ranks as the 13th-most likely seat to switch hands in November. Struggling to find the word "tossup" anywhere associated with the Florida Senate race, we asked the Meek campaign for help. They referred us to a blog post from the Wall Street Journal on Jan. 6, 2010. The post, entitled "2010 Tossups: A Rundown of the Most-Competitive Senate Races," includes Florida among 11 other races. About Florida, Susan Davis writes: "So much of the focus in this race has been on the Republican primary between Gov. Charlie Crist and former state House Speaker Marco Rubio that it's important to remember that either candidate still has to win a general election. Crist — back when Crist was seen as inevitable — was regularly leading likely Democratic nominee Rep. Kendrick Meek in the polls. But the evolving nature of the GOP primary, and what it says about the party and state, means that the Florida race is shaping up to be one of the more interesting and entertaining contests of the midterms." That's the only example Meek's campaign provided and we didn't find any others on our own. Meek spokesman Adam Sharon says the ratings may change based on the shifting dynamics of the Republican primary, where Crist is quickly losing his front-runner status, but we're checking Meek's statement based on current predictions. Meek says a number of national publications consider Florida's Senate race this fall a tossup. That number, however, appears to be just one. The overwhelming majority of pundits who attempt to predict election outcomes all have Republicans favored in the Sunshine State. Maybe the ratings will change. But they haven't yet. We rate Meek's claim Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.

pomt-03720	Says "a pack-a-day smoker who quits because of the tax increase will save about $1,650 a year."	true	/oregon/statements/2013/apr/15/nancy-nathanson/would-pack-day-smoker-save-1650-year-if-they-quit-/	Lawmakers in Salem are taking a look at the state’s cigarette tax and floating the possibility of allowing counties to add their own tax on top of the the current $1.18 per pack. Advocates spend a lot of time talking about how a higher per-pack price would cut the number of youth smokers -- and the various health benefits that would come with never starting. But Rep. Nancy Nathanson, D-Eugene, took a slightly different tack during a House floor speech earlier this month: Not only would an increased tax save some lungs, but if smokers quit as a result of the increase, their wallets would thank them, too. "A pack-a-day smoker who quits because of the tax increase will save about $1,650 a year to spend on other essential household goods and services, a not insubstantial number for that family," Nathanson said. We started thinking about everything we’d buy with that $1,600 -- some shoes, maybe, definitely a few new records, a new computer even. Then we remembered nobody at PolitiFact Oregon smokes. Still, we couldn’t help but wonder if Nathanson’s math added up. We gave her office a call and they told us the figures came from a study done by the Multnomah County Health Department. The department found that a pack ran between $4.37 to $4.97 with brands ranging from Marlboro, Lucky Strike, American Legend and Newport. That meant a pack-a-day smoker would save between $1,600 and $1,800. Nathanson’s $1,650 figure came from the cost of L&M cigarettes at WinCo, which was $4.51 a pack. The report’s figures came from this March and April but PolitiFact Oregon likes to do a little independent research for any given claim. We set out on our own and hit up a Safeway in downtown Portland for a price survey of our own. Cigarettes at Safeway do not come cheap. A pack of Marlboros came in at $6.20 and you’d have to fork over $8 for American Spirits. That’d put you at a yearly savings of anywhere between $2,250 and $2,900. (We’d buy two computers with that bonus.) We were about to check on the price of a carton of cigarettes because our moms taught us to shop in bulk, when the kind woman behind the counter said we ought to just walk a block to the nearest Plaid Pantry. There, you could get a pack for anywhere between $4.98 and $6.25. A carton of Marlboro reds came in at $50 for 10 packs, which seemed about right. The ruling: Nathanson said that a pack-a-day smoker would save $1,650 a year. Her numbers were based on a report from the Multnomah County Health Department, but it turns out that’s a pretty conservative estimate, at least for Portland. Still, her point is that quitting will save a hefty chunk of change and we rate that claim True.	None	Nancy Nathanson	None	None	None	2013-04-15T16:37:40	2013-04-04	['None']
pomt-11579	"Texas is home to more feral pigs than any other state — an estimated 50 percent to 75 percent of all feral swine in the nation."	half-true	/texas/statements/2018/feb/01/southwest-farm-press/more-feral-hogs-texas-than-any-other-state-but-not/	Texas happens to be home to most of the nation’s feral pigs, according to a publication focused on farmers and ranchers in Texas, New Mexico and Oklahoma. Southwest Farm Press declared in a January 2018 news story that while 39 states have reported wild pig problems, "Texas is home to more feral pigs than any other state — an estimated 50 percent to 75 percent of all feral swine in the nation." Really all of that for Texas by its lonesome? We wondered. Texas No. 1 in feral hogs? From our previous feral-hog investigations, we already suspected that Texas, with its vast open spaces and habitat-friendly Gulf Coast, was home to more of the pesky animals than any other state. Our attempts to verify that part of the publication’s claim led us to a South Carolina expert, Jack Mayer, Ph.D., who responded by emailing us his 2014 paper finding Texas to be home to the most wild hogs. According to the paper, 99 percent of U.S. wild pigs live in 10 states: Alabama, Arkansas, California, Florida, Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi, Oklahoma, South Carolina and Texas. "As an individual state, Texas had the largest numbers," the paper says, accounting for 30 percent (1.8 million) up to 41 percent (3.4 million) of the nation’s total depending on which estimates are chosen. States with the next-most feral hogs, the paper suggests, were Georgia and Florida. Then again, there’s at least one other way to judge population differences. In that vein, we adjusted the average estimate of feral hogs in each of the 10 high-hog states for the state’s 2014 human population. By this metric, Oklahoma led with nearly 13 hogs per 100 residents with Texas landing fifth with a little under 10 hogs per 100 residents. Up to three in four feral hogs live in Texas? We separately asked Southwest Farm Press the basis of its finding that Texas was home to "50 percent to 75 percent" of U.S. feral hogs. By email, Eric Braun responded with an explanation attributed to the story’s author, Logan Hawkes. "Fair question, tough topic," Hawkes wrote, adding that every count offered of feral hogs is an estimate. Hawkes specified that he reached his finding that 50 percent to 75 percent of U.S. feral hogs reside in Texas drawing on information from the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service in the U.S. Department of Agriculture and the Texas A&M Agrilife Extension Service. Hawkes said that "if the U.S. population is estimated as much as 6 million feral swine (USDA-APHIS), and the Texas population is as much as an estimated 4 million feral swine (Texas Agrilife), then I believe my percentage would be on target. If we take the lower estimated figures instead of the highest, then that percentage would, of course, be less. Again, the range is wide and all numbers are estimated. I should have pointed that out in retrospect." Braun pointed out that Gail Keirn of the APHIS National Wildlife Research Center was quoted in February 2017 saying that there are likely between 5 million and 6 million invasive wild pigs in at least 35 states. More recently, Braun noted, the inspection service has said the national count exceeds 6 million. Per feral pigs in Texas, Braun pointed out that Texas Agrilife said in a 2012 report that Texas was home to 1 million to 4 million feral hogs. Counting Texas feral hogs But that 2012 report, we found, presents the described estimate of 1 million to 4 million feral hogs in Texas (in the past tense) before declaring a lower estimate. The report initially states: "Often, the number of feral hogs are reported from 1 to 4 million in Texas. These estimates are not based on scientific studies." But the authors subsequently describe their efforts to gauge feral hog concentrations in different parts of Texas and to adjust for suitable hog habitats before reaching their own estimate. "By multiplying the density estimate to the total potential suitable feral hog habitat," the report says, "we estimated the number of feral hogs statewide to be between 1.8 and 3.4 million, with the average being 2.6 million." We also connected with the USDA’s Keirn, who agreed by email that Texas has one of the country’s largest "feral swine populations." Yet Keirn said the state’s share of U.S. feral hogs probably runs closer to 30 percent to 50 percent. Nationally, Keirn told us, the feral hog population is "currently estimated at over 6 million and is rapidly expanding. Range expansion over the last few decades is due to a variety of factors including their adaptability to a variety of climates and conditions, translocation by humans and a lack of natural predators." Keirn similarly noted the 2012 Texas report suggesting an average of 2.6 million feral hogs statewide while she said that the Texas Parks & Wildlife Department estimates there are more than 1.5 million feral swine in the state. "The accurate estimation of wildlife populations is difficult and requires considerable investment of resources and time," Keirn wrote. When we reached out to TPWD about its hog estimate, Steve Lightfoot responded by emailing us a September 2017 document presenting 42 feral hog questions and answers written by a Texas A&M professor emeritus, Billy Higginbotham. The document says there are no U.S. estimates of the feral hog population based on scientific data but guesstimates suggest a national population of 8 million to 9 million. In Texas, the document says, "we estimate 2.6 million head based on several population studies." Another Higginbotham answer says a Texas A&M AgriLife Extension survey of landowners made in 2010 "estimated that we are removing approximately 761,000 pigs from our 2.6 million population annually, which accounts for only 29% of the population. We estimate that in Texas we need to be removing 66% of the wild pigs annually just to hold the population steady." We asked Higginbotham about the accuracy of the Southwest Farm Press claim. By email, he replied that it’s most likely that feral hogs in Texas comprise 20 percent to no more than 33 percent of the U.S. population. Mayer, the South Carolina expert, later advised by phone that he’s part of a research team drawing on improved hog-density research to devise fresh counts. As of 1982, Mayer said, a little more than half the nation’s feral hogs resided in Texas. Mayer said the team’s yet-to-be completed paper will say that in 2016, some 2.5 million Texas feral hogs accounted for nearly 37 percent of 6.9 million U.S. feral hogs. Texas’s reduced share, Mayer said, can be attributed to hog populations surging elsewhere. We shared some of what we’d gleaned about U.S. feral hogs in Texas with Southwest Farm Press. By email, Braun replied that its story would be corrected. The story was shortly amended to say: "Texas is home to more feral pigs than any other state — an estimated 30 percent to 50 percent of all feral swine in the nation, according to USDA." Our ruling The publication said: "Texas is home to more feral pigs than any other state — an estimated 50 percent to 75 percent of all feral swine in the nation." Texas remains home to the most feral hogs, we confirmed, though several states topped by Oklahoma lately have more hogs per 100 residents. It looks otherwise like Texas accounts for about one third of the nation’s feral swine--considerably short of 50 percent to 75 percent. We rate this since-modified claim Half True.

A June 2, 2017, post on NewsForMeToday.com said that the Earth will go dark later this year with the headline, "NASA confirms Earth will experience 15 days of darkness In November 2017." Facebook users flagged the article as possibly being fabricated, as part of the social media site’s efforts to identify fake news stories. "NASA confirms what’s been circling the web recently – our planet Earth will experience total darkness for 15 days in November 2017 starting from November 15 to November 29," the post read. Specifically, the event "will start on November 15 at 3:00 am and will most likely last until November 30, 4:45 pm." The post also quotes NASA administrator Charles Bolden as saying the so-called "blackout event" will raise the Earth’s temperature up to 8 degrees, but should have no lasting effects. "This event would be similar to what Alaskans experience in the winter," Bolden is quoted. For the record, Bolden resigned on Jan. 20, 2017. There also was something in there about the alignment of Venus and Jupiter and a hydrogen explosion in space, but that doesn’t matter, because the story is a persistent Internet concoction that isn’t true. The NewsForMeToday.com post doesn’t link to any official source, a sure warning sign of an unreliable news report, but does cite a Jan. 12, 2017, post on ReflectionofMind.org. That site, in turn, links back to a now-defunct page on GlobalRevolutionNetwork.com, which the Internet Archive told us was originally dated Oct. 24, 2016, and warned of the event happening in November of that year. This unfounded rumor goes back to at least 2015, and has been posted time and again. Dates and details may change (one version said a solar storm would darken the Earth for six days in December), but none of them were correct. We couldn’t find any evidence of NASA making such an announcement, of course. We contacted NASA about the possibility an inky fortnight of celestial shenanigans, but didn’t immediately hear back. The fake story about Earth going dark has been around for some time, but it’s time we bring this hoax to light. We rate it Pants On Fire!

pomt-01581	Says on contraception, his plan is "cheaper and easier for you" than Sen. Mark Udall’s	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2014/sep/08/cory-gardner/cory-gardner-says-his-plan-contraceptives-namely-p/	Democratic Sen. Mark Udall has consistently attacked his Republican challenger, Rep. Cory Gardner, for supporting anti-abortion measures like personhood legislation. But Gardner is on the offensive with a new ad airing in the Colorado Senate race about women’s health issues. "What’s the difference between me and Mark Udall on contraception?" Gardner says. "I believe the pill ought to be available over the counter, around the clock, without a prescription. Cheaper and easier for you. Mark Udall’s plan is different. He wants to keep government bureaucrats between you and your health care plan. That means more politics and more profits for drug companies. My plan means more rights, more freedom and more control for you." Udall’s "plan" is essentially the Affordable Care Act, which requires health insurance companies to provide access to FDA-approved contraceptives without cost sharing, meaning the consumer pays nothing for their prescription at the pharmacy. Gardner, who has repeatedly voted to repeal President Barack Obama’s health care law, says he believes a "cheaper and easier" alternative is to allow the pill to be sold over the counter, meaning without a prescription. Gardner’s campaign said his plan has two parts: Allow the pill to be sold over-the-counter and "ensure that women can be reimbursed for those through insurance." His campaign said both can be accomplished without the Affordable Care Act. If the Affordable Care Act is not repealed, though, Gardner wants to allow insurance providers to cover the pill over-the-counter without a prescription. Udall’s campaign said he supports allowing over-the-counter sales of the pill as long as insurance companies are still mandated to cover it without any cost sharing. So we’re left comparing the Affordable Care Act to Gardner’s position, which is repeal the ACA and replace its contraceptive component with his proposal. Which contraceptive plan is "cheaper and easier"? We found that even the groups that advocate making the pill available over the counter — like Jessica Arons, president and CEO of the Reproductive Health Technologies Project and Dan Grossman, vice president for research at Ibis Reproductive Health — did not believe it was a cheaper alternative for consumers than requiring insurance companies to cover contraceptives without cost sharing. Gardner’s campaign pointed us to a study by the Consumer Healthcare Products Association, an advocacy group for the consumer health care products industry. The study looked at savings from several different drugs becoming available over-the-counter, but not the pill. The group estimated that each dollar spent on over-the-counter medicines saves the health care system up to $7, which comes to $102 billion annually. About $25 billion of those savings come in the form of reduced drug costs. But the bulk of the savings is actually from avoiding trips to the doctor to get a prescription, the association found. (Imagine going to the doctor every time you had a cold to get a prescription for Sudafed or for Claritin when your allergies flared up. Those visits add up.) However, under the Affordable Care Act, women’s preventive health care must be covered without cost-sharing, meaning a trip to the doctor to get a prescription for birth control would not have any out-of-pocket costs. So a big chunk of the alleged savings from moving the pill over-the-counter would not be realized; it’s already not costing consumers anything. It’s also speculative for Gardner to insist that his plan is cheaper. As far as we can tell, there hasn’t been a study that looks specifically at the cost benefits of moving the pill over-the-counter, and a spokesperson for the Consumer Healthcare Products Association told us that they "can't speak to any specific product or ingredient." That’s not to say that providing birth control without cost-sharing, as the Affordable Care Act does, is free to the healthcare system. When insurance companies are required to cover birth control or doctor visits without asking for a co-payment, those costs are baked into the monthly premium. You may not have to pay anything at the pharmacy, but you may pay for it in other ways, especially if you previously chose not to purchase insurance and suddenly are forced by the law to buy a policy. Some grandfathered plans may also choose to not cover these services and it does not address the millions of individuals who would remain uninsured under the law. Zack Cooper, a health policy and economics professor at Princeton University, said it’s possible that if the pill was reclassified as over-the-counter, consumers would have more options, sales volume would go up and competition would increase between drug companies. These factors can all lead to prices going down. But he said it’s also possible that it has a negative effect, since suddenly consumers are paying for birth control at the point-of-purchase instead of getting it at no cost. "When you make something even a little more expensive, use goes down," Cooper said. "That means more women get pregnant, and babies cost a lot more than birth control. You can argue it would actually increase the cost of insurance and the government will be on the hook for more federal subsidies." So there’s a lot of uncertainty as to which would actually be cheaper. We would also like to see more details from Gardner on how he would "ensure that women can be reimbursed for (the pill) through insurance," but so far he has not produced legislation or a detailed summary. And Gardner’s plan only applies to one particular birth control: the pill. While the pill is the most common form of birth control, it’s not the only method. About 27 percent of female contraceptive users reported that the pill was their prefered method, meaning three-quarters use another option (though this survey included male condoms and vasectomies, which aren’t covered by the law and make up a big chunk of contraceptive use). Other birth control methods may be more effective or more preferable for certain patients, but they are also a lot more expensive at the point of purchase, said Alina Salganicoff, vice president and director of Women’s Health Policy at the Kaiser Family Foundation. Like intrauterine devices, which can cost $500 to $1,000 without insurance. So when Gardner asks "what’s the difference between me and Mark Udall on contraception," but only provides a plan for the pill, he’s leaving out a lot of people who medically cannot use the pill or chose another option. Absent the Affordable Care Act, these other methods would undoubtedly be more expensive for consumers. Similarly, it would definitely be "easier" for a lot of individuals to obtain the pill over-the-counter instead of going to a doctor first to get a prescription, especially those who live in rural areas where a doctor’s office is not nearly as close as the corner pharmacy. But this again does not address all contraceptives, just the pill. Gardner’s campaign also noted that the American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists issued an opinion in 2012 expressing medical support for over-the-counter access to oral contraceptives. However, the group also maintained its support for the Affordable Care Act provision that provides women access to the pill without cost-sharing, noting that "numerous studies have shown that even small cost-sharing requirements can limit use of needed preventative care." Our ruling Gardner said his plan on contraceptives is "cheaper and easier for you" than Sen. Mark Udall’s plan. This is based on his support for a plan to allow for over-the-counter sales of the pill. Gardner’s plan is lacking in concrete details that would allow a thorough evaluation. There’s some evidence that health care costs generally go down when drugs are made available over-the-counter, but those studies did not look specifically look at the pill. There is a lot of uncertainty and experts — from advocates to economists — question whether Gardner’s proposal would be cheaper to most consumers or the health care system compared to the Affordable Care Act. And Gardner’s plan would only address one type of contraceptive, meaning the many people who choose other methods of birth control would see higher costs. We rate the statement Mostly False.

pomt-14540	Says state Supreme Court candidate Joe Donald twice "supported" incumbent Justice Rebecca Bradley.	mostly true	/wisconsin/statements/2016/feb/14/joanne-kloppenburg/one-state-supreme-court-candidate-once-backed-cand/	The first TV ad run by state Appeals Court Judge JoAnne Kloppenburg in the Wisconsin Supreme Court campaign criticizes Justice Rebecca Bradley, who was appointed to the high court by Republican Gov. Scott Walker. Then the ad turns quickly to Milwaukee County Circuit Judge Joe Donald, who is the third candidate in the Feb. 16, 2016 primary for Bradley’s seat. The two candidates who get the most votes will face off in the April 5, 2016 general election. "Joe Donald," the narrator says in Kloppenburg’s ad, which was released Feb. 8, 2016, "he supported Rebecca Bradley, Walker’s choice, twice." At the same time, these words are shown on the screen: "Donald twice supported Walker appointee Bradley," with the quote attributed to a blog. Kloppenburg, who is running from the left, is associating Donald with the candidate who is clearly on the right. As we’ll see, Donald’s support for Bradley was explicit for one judicial post, but split for another. The candidates Kloppenburg, of Madison, ran for the Supreme Court once before, in 2011. Then an assistant state attorney general, she lost to Justice David Prosser in a race so close it went to a recount. Kloppenburg won election to the Madison-based District 4 Court of Appeals in 2012. Bradley, of the Milwaukee suburb of Wauwatosa, was appointed to the Supreme Court by Walker in October 2015 after the death of Justice Patrick Crooks, and is now running for the seat for the first time. Bradley had also been appointed by Walker to the Milwaukee-based District 1 Court of Appeals in May 2015 and before that to the Milwaukee County Circuit Court in 2012. Donald, of Milwaukee, was appointed to the Milwaukee County bench in 1996 by GOP Gov. Tommy Thompson and has won election to the court four times, without opposition. He is also running for the high court for the first time. The Milwaukee County court is the link between Bradley and Donald. Given her incumbency and her position on the ideological scale, Bradley is expected to advance to the general election, which means the real race in the primary is between Kloppenburg and Donald. Kloppenburg’s evidence On Kloppenburg’s claim that Donald twice supported Bradley, let’s look at the instances cited by Kloppenburg’s campaign. Both were first reported by WisPolitics.com. 1. Donald specifically endorsed Bradley in 2013 in her first run for the Milwaukee County Circuit Court. She had been appointed the year before by Walker to the seat, and defeated two challengers in the election. It is common for sitting judges to support one another in elections, something Donald’s campaign itself has said in explaining Donald’s backing of Bradley. Donald, though, has also said he got "bamboozled," telling WisPolitics: "I really thought (Bradley) was about being a trial court judge. It became apparent that it had nothing to do with it, that this was clearly a process to put her in place to put her on the Supreme Court." 2. Donald gave his name as a reference when Bradley applied to fill the 2015 vacancy on the state appeals court -- but he also recommended that Walker choose another candidate. Bradley’s application letter to Walker lists Donald as one of four references, noting that Donald had previously served as presiding judge of the Milwaukee County Children’s Court. Bradley served there after being appointed to the Milwaukee court by Walker. Donald’s campaign acknowledges that Donald consented to Bradley listing him as a reference for her appeals court application. But the campaign also cites a letter Donald wrote to Walker in which Donald recommended that Walker choose Milwaukee County Circuit Judge Timothy Dugan for the slot. So, in contrast to the first instance, when Donald’s support for Bradley was unilateral, his support in the second instance was split. Our rating Kloppenburg says Donald twice "supported" Bradley. Donald explicitly endorsed Bradley in a 2013 election for the Milwaukee County Circuit Court. When there was a vacancy on the state appeals court in 2015, Donald supported Bradley by allowing her to use him as a reference in her application, although he also recommended that the governor choose a different applicant for the post. For a statement that is accurate but needs additional information, our rating is Mostly True.	None	JoAnne Kloppenburg	None	None	None	2016-02-14T05:00:00	2016-02-08	['None']
pomt-12283	"U.N. official John Ashe set to testify against the Clintons may not have died by accident."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2017/jun/30/blog-posting/blogger-falsely-ties-death-un-official-clintons/	A self-described conservative blog revived a rumor from the Clinton body count archives. The blog Conservative Politicus had the stirring headline "U.N. official John Ashe set to testify against the Clintons may not have died by accident after all," on June 17. This has the essential ingredients to meet the appetite of any conspiracy fan: Clintons, a legal case and a dead man. That doesn’t mean those elements are on the money. Yes, Ashe died in 2016, and yes, there was a criminal case. But no, he wasn’t going to testify against either Bill or Hillary Clinton. Now, for the back story. John Ashe represented Antigua and Barbuda at the United Nations and at one time served as president of the General Assembly. In October 2015, the FBI accused Ashe of receiving at least $500,000 in bribes to benefit a Chinese businessman named Ng Lap Seng. Ng isn’t a household name today but back in 1998, a Senate report identified him as the source of hundreds of thousands of dollars funneled through an Arkansas restaurant owner to the Democratic National Committee and the Clinton-Gore campaign in the mid 1990s. Ng visited the White House 10 times. That is the known extent of any Clinton connection. In June 2016, the rumor-busting website Snopes asked the office of the U.S. District Attorney for the Southern District of New York if their case involved either Clinton. A spokesman said not at all. The complaint against Ashe makes no mention of the Clintons. Ashe wasn’t scheduled to testify against the Clintons. He was slated for what the spokesman described to Snopes as a standard pre-trial meeting. As for Ashe’s death, he died at home in June 2016 when a barbell crushed his throat. That happened near the time he was scheduled to meet with prosecutors. The death was ruled an accident. Several conspiracy-minded posts emerged soon after his death. One about a month afterward included Ashe’s name with two others who allegedly died under mysterious circumstances. The one common thread was a tie to the Clintons. Our ruling A conservative blog revived a year-old rumor that a UN official died shortly before he was going to testify against the Clintons. While the man did die and he was scheduled to meet with prosecutors, that’s the extent of the accuracy here. Prosecutors said Ashe had received at least half a million dollars in bribes, and he was headed for trial. The case had no connection to the Clintons, except that the man who allegedly provided the bribe had illegally given to Democrats about 20 years earlier. The official autopsy found he died in an accident and no evidence suggests otherwise. We rate this claim False.

pomt-04085	Kohl’s Department Stores in 2012 "announced the creation of 3,000 new jobs."	half-true	/wisconsin/statements/2013/jan/19/scott-walker/citing-his-accomplishments-gov-scott-walker-says-b/	In his "state of the state" speech on Jan. 15, 2013, Gov. Scott Walker said Wisconsin is improving as a place for doing business, then boasted of a job-creation coup. "Employers feel good about our state," the Republican governor said, reflecting on the first half of his four-year term. "During the past year, Kohl’s Department Stores worked with us and announced the creation of 3,000 new jobs." In a state with unemployment well above 6 percent, having 3,000 jobs set to come online would be huge news. But that’s not the headline we remember. Indeed, no ground has yet been broken on a second corporate headquarters for Kohl’s that was announced in 2012, although planning is well under way. When it comes to employment, there are jobs and even promised jobs. Then there are potential jobs. Saying Kohl’s "announced the creation of 3,000 new jobs" is different than saying Kohl expects or hopes to hire that many people. Where does this one stand? Growth of Kohl’s The first Kohl’s department store opened in 1962 next to a Kohl’s grocery store in the Milwaukee suburb of Brookfield. Both the department store chain and the now-defunct grocery chain were started by Max Kohl, the father of Herb Kohl, who served for 24 years as a U.S. senator from Wisconsin before deciding not to seek re-election in 2012. Kohl’s is now a chain of more than 1,100 family-oriented department stores in 49 states, selling Jennifer Lopez, Princess Vera Wang and other lines of clothing, as well as a variety of home goods and other items. With $18.8 billion in sales in 2011, the publicly traded company -- which is no longer connected with the Kohl family -- ranked 20th on the National Retail Federation’s 2012 list of the nation’s top 100 retailers. In December 2011, news surfaced that Menomonee Falls-based Kohl’s, which has 4,900 corporate employees in the Milwaukee area, might be close to announcing a decision on where to build a second headquarters building. Milwaukee was competing with Menomonee Falls, its suburban neighbor, for the $250 million corporate expansion. Three months later, Kohl’s said it had decided against downtown Milwaukee and in July 2012, the company announced its chosen site in Menomonee Falls. Walker’s evidence When we asked Walker spokesman Cullen Werwie for evidence to support Walker's claim, he provided us a news article and a news release from the governor. Like a number of other news articles during the year, the four-paragraph November 2012 news item in the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel said the new headquarters was expected to create 3,000 jobs over 12 years. The Walker news release was issued on the day Kohl's announced the Menomonee Falls site. Walker said in the release that Kohl's would receive up to $62.5 million in state tax credits over 12 years, but the actual amount "will be completely dependent upon the number of newly created jobs and the amount of Kohl’s capital expenditure." The state Economic Development Corp. said that under the deal, Kohl’s must retain 4,500 jobs, create 3,000 jobs and invest $250 million in new and existing facilities to get the full amount of the tax credits. So, even news releases from Walker’s office and one of his state agencies talk about the possibility of 3,000 jobs, not a certainty that they had been or would soon be created. Indeed, in a Milwaukee Business Journal article published the same day as Walker’s news release, Kohl’s chairman and chief executive officer Kevin Mansell said "up to 3,000 jobs could be added" over 12 years. That’s a projection that, even if well founded, doesn’t amount to a commitment to create that many jobs. And there’s no way to know whether economic conditions over 12 years will enable Kohl’s to reach its hiring goal. Our rating Walker said that in 2012, Kohl’s Department Stores "announced the creation of 3,000 new jobs." What Kohl’s announced is it would build a new headquarters and expected to create 3,000 jobs, over 12 years -- not that 3,000 jobs were a certainty. For being partially accurate but leaving out important details, we rate Walker’s statement Half True.	None	Scott Walker	None	None	None	2013-01-19T09:00:00	2013-01-15	['None']
pomt-13919	As a result of Roe vs. Wade, "America’s maternal mortality rate dropped dramatically."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/jun/24/hillary-clinton/hillary-clinton-pregnancy-related-deaths-dropped-a/	Hillary Clinton says her opponent Donald Trump wants to take the country back to a time that was bad for women’s reproductive health. "When Donald Trump says ‘let’s make America great again,’ that is code for ‘let’s take America backward.’ Back to a time when opportunity and dignity were reserved for some, not all," she said in June 10 remarks at a Planned Parenthood event. "Back to the days when abortion was illegal, women had far fewer options, and life for too many women and girls was limited. Well, Donald, those days are over." Clinton went on to note significant moments in history for women’s health, notably the 1973 Supreme Court ruling that legalized abortion, Roe vs. Wade. "So young women were no longer dying in emergency rooms and back alleys from botched, illegal abortions," she said. "And this is a fact that is not often heard, but I hope you will repeat it: America’s maternal mortality rate dropped dramatically." We decided to look into Clinton’s factoid: that Roe vs. Wade resulted in a decreased number of women dying as a result of pregnancy complications. Maternal mortality rates, which are the number of deaths per 100,000 live births, were already declining rapidly in the years prior to the January 1973 Roe vs. Wade decision, according to the Vital Statistics of the United States, maintained by the Centers for Disease Control. This is also true looking just at mortality rates related to abortion. In 1965, about 32 women for every 100,000 live births died as a result of pregnancy complications, including abortions. It fell steadily every year leading up to Roe in 1973, when the rate was 15.2. The rate continued to decrease in the years after, to 9.6 in 1979. You can see in the graph that there is a slightly bigger drop than previous years in maternal mortality rates between 1972 and 1973, during which the Supreme Court decided Roe. The same pattern is visible for abortion-related deaths, with a rate of 6.3 in 1965, falling to fewer than 1 in the years after Roe. Both overall maternal mortality and abortion mortality were declining in the years leading up to Roe due to better antibiotics, blood banks and other medical advancements, said David Grimes, a clinical professor in obstetrics and gynecology at the University of North Carolina School of Medicine. However, the decline in abortion related-deaths accelerated when abortion started to become legal. It’s also worth noting that before abortion became legal, the number of abortions — and thus the number of abortion-related deaths — were likely underreported. While Roe is a focal point, the decline in maternal mortality as a result of legalized abortion took place over about a decade — from the time states began to legalize abortion on their own in 1966 to when the rest transitioned to complying with the Supreme Court ruling in the late 1970s, said Johanna Schoen, an expert in reproductive rights history and professor at Rutgers University. By the time the court decided Roe in 1973, New York, Alaska, Hawaii and Washington legalized abortion in nearly all cases, while about 13 other states legalized it in some cases, such as in the case of rape or incest. Legalizing abortion gave medical professionals the okay to conduct the procedure out in the open and to research safer methods, which helped bring overall maternal mortality rates down. So not only were women moving from less-safe illegal abortions to legal ones, the legal abortions were becoming safer. In fact, receiving an abortion now carries a lower mortality risk than moving forward with a pregnancy. "With the legalization of abortion and the simultaneous introduction of medical equipment to perform first trimester abortions with vacuum aspiration machines, a previously clandestine and dangerous procedure became safe, quick, and inexpensive almost overnight," Schoen wrote in her book, Abortion after Roe. The fact that legalizing abortion was able to affect overall maternal mortality rates is a testament to how many women were having abortions at the time, Schoen told PolitiFact. In a stark turn of events, maternal mortality rates are currently on the rise in the United States, according to the Centers for Disease Control. This sets the United States apart from its peer countries, which have generally seen continued declines. Researchers hypothesize that the increase has to do with women getting pregnant while suffering from a chronic illness like diabetes, more women giving birth via higher-risk cesarean sections, or hospitals are getting better at reporting maternal deaths. Our ruling As a result of Roe vs. Wade, "America’s maternal mortality rate dropped dramatically." Rates of women dying as a result of pregnancy complications were already on the decline when the Supreme Court decided Roe vs. Wade. But experts told us that a primary reason behind this trend was legalizing abortion nationwide, which took place over a decade, with Roe as a focal point. So Roe solidified this improvement in maternal mortality rates.

pomt-00551	"In just 17 years, spending for Social Security, federal health care and interest on the debt will exceed ALL tax revenue!"	mostly true	/virginia/statements/2015/jun/16/dave-brat/brat-says-entitlement-and-debt-payments-will-consu/	The day of financial reckoning is near, says U.S. Rep. Dave Brat. "In just 17 years, spending for Social Security, federal health care and interest on the debt will exceed ALL tax revenue!" Brat, R-7th, wrote in a May 29 Facebook post. That would mean no money for defense or domestic programs unless Uncle Sam wanted to put these items on his already overburdened credit card. "Continuing down this path of rampant federal spending and debt expansion is not an option," Brat wrote. "It will push us ever closer to fiscal crisis. Getting our spending under control and working to balance our budget must begin now." We wondered whether the 17-year warning -- also being sounded by the Republican leadership on the House Budget Committee, on which Brat serves -- is accurate. Brian Gottstein, a spokesman for Brat, said the claim is based on figures published by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office in its "2014 Long-Term Budget Outlook," issued last July. It contains two scenarios that could happen if Congress doesn’t take strong action to reduce deficits. The first one assumes that all the major U.S. budget laws in July 2014 will remain in effect. That means Congress will continue sequestration which sets limits on defense and domestic spending, allows a buffet of popular tax cuts to expire as scheduled and doesn’t adjust tax brackets to soften inflationary increases in workers’ earnings. Under these assumptions, the CBO says spending on Social Security, Medicaid, Medicare and debt interest will top tax revenues in 2044. As bleak as that might seem, there’s an alternative scenario that’s even gloomier. This is the one Brat embraces. It essentially assumes that Congress will lack the courage to continue unpopular budget policies and, as a result, spending will go up and many taxes will do down. The alternative scenario supposes that Congress will abandon sequestration and continue to extend tax cuts that are scheduled to expire -- most notably tax breaks on research and development, first-year capital investments costs and income gained through foreign corporations in nations with high tax rates. Under these assumptions, the CBO says spending on Social Security, federal health care and debt interest would exceed taxes in 2031. That’s 16 years from now. Is it fair for Brat to focus on the worst scenario? Two analysts told us yes, noting Congress already has a history of relenting on deficit-reducing policies. For example, Congress voted in 2013 to permanently extend the bulk of income tax cuts that were approved during the presidency of George W. Bush. The cuts were originally slated to expire in 2010. "The alternative fiscal scenario understands how some of the tough choices Congress needs to make conflict with promises members have made to their constituents," said Eugene Steuerle, an economist at the Urban Institute. "Most people who would have to pick between the two scenarios would say Congress would most likely use the alternative one." Marc Goldwein, senior vice president of the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, called Brat’s statement "credible." A major point in the CBO report is that the day of reckoning is avoidable if Congress can break its standoff between Republicans, including Brat, who oppose tax increases, and Democrats who oppose cuts to entitlement programs. The report says, "To put the federal budget on a sustainable path for the long term, lawmakers would have to make significant changes to tax and spending policies: reducing spending for large benefit programs below the projected levels, letting revenues rise more than they would under current law, or adopting some combination of those approaches." Our ruling Brat says that under the current U.S. path, "In just 17 years, spending for Social Security, federal health care and interest on the federal debt will exceed all tax revenue." A CBO report concludes that, in a worst-case scenario in which Congress resumes its old habits of cutting taxes and raising spending, this could happen in 2031 -- 16 years from now. Under a somewhat rosier scenario, in which current budget policies are kept in effect, the U.S. would hit bottom in 2044. Brat’s focus on the bleaker outlook is defensible because Congress this century has not shown great fiscal discipline. We’re dealing with scenarios, however, and Brat’s statement would have been more accurate if he acknowledged from the outset that the U.S. "could" run out of tax money for many major programs instead of saying it "will." No doubt, however, the U.S. is on a risky fiscal path. We rate Brat’s statement Mostly True.	None	Dave Brat	None	None	None	2015-06-16T10:41:06	2015-05-29	['None']
pomt-08772	"Joe Sestak ... even wants to bring back the death tax, letting the IRS take half of your savings when you die."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/aug/24/pat-toomey/pat-toomey-hits-joe-sestak-estate-tax-leaves-out-s/	In his Senate race against Rep. Joe Sestak, D-Pa., former Republican Rep. Pat Toomey is using a favorite GOP issue: taxes. In an ad, Toomey charges that "Joe Sestak ... even wants to bring back the death tax, letting the IRS take half of your savings when you die." Before we look at the substance of the ad, let's first take a closer look at what Toomey calls the "death tax" and what others call the "estate tax." According to the IRS, the decades-old estate tax was levied until recently on "your right to transfer property at your death. It consists of an accounting of everything you own or have certain interests in at the date of death," including such items as cash and securities, real estate, insurance, trusts, annuities and business interests. Various factors reduce the gross amount subject to the tax, such as mortgages and other debts, amounts passed to surviving spouses and a credit that shields upwards of $1 million per person, and double that for a couple. Unless Congress and the president act to eliminate it permanently, the estate tax won't exist at all for exactly one year -- 2010. This oddity came about as a result of the passage of the Economic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2001, which was one of the tax cuts proposed and signed by President George W. Bush. The 2001 law slowly ratcheted down the estate tax's rates and ratcheted up the amount excluded from the tax, concluding with a total elimination of the tax for 2010. At the end of 2010, the estate tax would return to its levels in the early part of the decade -- a $1 million exclusion and a 55 percent top rate -- though many expect that Congress would either act before then to set new levels or eliminate the tax entirely. We see two questions to ask in evaluating in Toomey's ad. The first is whether Sestak "wants to bring back the death tax." The second is whether it's accurate to say that the tax "(lets) the IRS take half of your savings when you die." On the first question, both Toomey and Sestak have points to make. Toomey's camp points to votes Sestak took in Congress that supported continuation of the estate tax. In one of them, on Dec. 3, 2009, Sestak voted with 225 other Democrats (and no Republicans) to pass the Permanent Estate Tax Relief for Families, Farmers, and Small Businesses Act of 2009. This legislation -- which passed the House but stalled in the Senate -- would have established the top estate tax rate at 45 percent and set the exclusion rate at $3,500,000 per person or $7 million per couple. (This happens to be the Obama administration's proposal as well.) Immediately prior to that vote, Sestak voted against a GOP-backed "motion to recommit" that would have asked lawmakers to go back to the drawing board and permanently eliminate the tax. When we spoke to Sestak's camp, they confirmed that their candidate continues to support the position he voted for in the 2009 bill. However, they took issue with Toomey's characterization of his position as one that would "bring back" the tax. A Sestak spokesman noted that it was actually the 2001 bill -- which Toomey himself voted for -- that is the reason why the estate tax is set to pop back to life in 2011 (and at a higher tax rate and lower exclusion level than what Sestak supports). We accept the Sestak camp's point, but we believe it's ultimately a bit of semantics. Toomey's main point is that, one way or another, Sestak, unlike Toomey, wants there to be an estate tax of some sort after the tax's disappearance in 2010, and the Sestak camp confirms that he stands by the estate tax parameters he voted for in 2009. Now to the second question -- the ad's claim that the tax "(lets) the IRS take half of your savings when you die." On the surface, what the ad says is close to true -- that is, unless Congress and the president agree to new terms before Dec. 31 of this year, the new top estate tax rate in 2010 would be 55 percent, which is slightly over the "half" indicated by the ad. However, the ad glosses over three pieces of context that are important. The first is that the ad says a reinstated tax would "(let) the IRS take half of your savings when you die," giving the impression that many of those watching would be subject to it. Yet the reality is that in any given year, very few families would pay the tax, and all of them would be quite wealthy. According to calculations by the Urban Institute-Brookings Institution Tax Policy Center, the 2009 proposal Sestak voted for would levy the tax on 6,400 estates nationwide in 2011 -- about three-tenths of one percent of all those who die that year. (By comparison, the estate tax that would apply in 2011 without any congressional action would levy the tax on 44,200 estates -- still only 2 percent of deaths that year, but about seven times higher that what Sestak voted for.) The second problem is that even those families that do pay the tax would not pay it on half their savings, as the ad states. Because of the exclusions, the "effective" tax rate -- that is, the tax levied divided by the total amount of assets considered under the tax -- averages around 20 percent, according to the liberal Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. The last problem is that Sestak supports setting the estate tax rate at 45 percent. Even ignoring the much lower "effective" tax rate due to the $3.5 million-per-person exclusion, that top tax rate falls short of the "half" that Toomey's ad indicates. Advocates of eliminating the estate tax defended the ad's distillation of a complicated subject. "In politics, as opposed to policy writing, you have a very brief time to get across any message, so I don't think it is realistic for candidates to include all the caveats," said Dan Mitchell, a senior fellow at the libertarian Cato Institute. "So I would view Toomey's ad as kosher, much as I would feel it would be acceptable if Sestak were to run an ad about Toomey wanting to 'put people's retirement incomes at the mercy of Wall Street.' It's Sestak's job to criticize Toomey's ad, just as it's Toomey's responsibility to to go after Sestak when his positions get caricatured." To recap, while there is some truth to Toomey's claim because Sestak supports reviving the estate tax, Toomey exaggerates the scope of the tax, incorrectly implying that it would apply to far more taxpayers, and that it applies to their entire estates. In fact, only the wealthiest Americans would pay the tax under the proposal that Sestak supports, and the proposal would exclude $3.5 million per person and $7 million per couple. On balance, then, we rate the ad Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.

pomt-00800	Say Apple’s Tim Cook "will not do business with Indiana."	false	/punditfact/statements/2015/apr/02/erick-erickson/redstate-editor-decries-apple-chief-not-doing-busi/	Some social conservatives have had it with backlash directed at Indiana over its Religious Freedom Restoration Act. In a column for conservative grassroots site RedState.com, editor-in-chief Erick Erickson criticized business owners and people on the left who say the law will allow anyone to cite religious belief in refusing to serve gays and lesbians. Erickson’s opening sentence hones in on Apple chief executive Tim Cook for what he sees as hypocritical business practices. "To recap: Tim Cook (please, please click this link) and the left are happy to do business in countries that stone to death or otherwise jail gay people, but will not do business with Indiana," Erickson wrote, "which merely passed a law insisting that the ‘free exercise’ clause of the first amendment be on the same legal footing in courts as the ‘free speech’ clause of the first amendment." Erickson would not respond to our requests for more information, but his point is fairly evident: Apple will do business in countries where being gay is illegal (there were more than 70 such countries as of 2013) but won’t do business with Indiana. That turns out to be putting words in Apple’s mouth. What Cook said Cook, who has been Apple’s CEO since 2011, started speaking out against Indiana’s religious freedom law with a couple of tweets March 27, the day after Republican Gov. Mike Pence signed the measure into law. Cook wasn’t done criticizing the law. In a March 29 Washington Post op-ed, Cook, who is gay, warned that the legislation in Indiana and other states allows people to cite personal religious beliefs as a reason not to serve a customer based on sexual orientation. (Some experts say such refusals along these lines under Religious Freedom Restoration Acts would not win out in court, but the law may lead some people to think they have that right.) "Our message, to people around the country and around the world, is this: Apple is open," he wrote. "Open to everyone, regardless of where they come from, what they look like, how they worship or who they love. Regardless of what the law might allow in Indiana or Arkansas, we will never tolerate discrimination." Cook also said, "on behalf of Apple, I’m standing up to oppose this new wave of legislation — wherever it emerges." Strong words, yes. But like his tweets, the op-ed said nothing about the company no longer doing business with Indiana. We searched and found no other instance of Cook, or Apple, making comments about Indiana’s law or suggesting they would not do business in, or with, the state. Erickson did not respond to us via our email, phone or Twitter queries. Instead, he posted a blog on RedState saying "Seriously. Sometimes a tweet is just a tweet." (Erickson’s post was not a tweet, it was a column.) Erickson isn’t alone among bloggers in the right-wing blogosphere who hold up the company’s Middle East presence in criticizing the CEO’s stance toward Indiana. Apple has locations in predominantly Muslim countries where some states or sects under sharia law punish homosexuality with death, including Saudi Arabia, Nigeria and Qatar. As for Indiana, the state is home to two Apple retail stores in malls in Indianapolis and Mishawaka. Both were still in operation April 2, 2015, when we called. An Apple spokesman offered no additional comment. Our ruling In trying to call out Apple’s Cook for clashing business practices over gay rights, Erickson said Cook "will not do business with Indiana." That is not true based on Cook’s public remarks on Twitter and in an op-ed. Cook has been outspoken in his position against the law and others like it across the country, but Apple stores remain open in Indiana and iPhones, iMacs and everything else is still being sold.

pomt-11571	"Incredibly, some Tallahassee politicians want to make Florida a sanctuary state."	half-true	/florida/statements/2018/feb/02/richard-corcoran/do-tallahassee-politicians-want-make-florida-sanct/	A dramatic new ad for tougher immigration policies by Florida House Speaker Richard Corcoran’s political committee has drawn national attention and criticism from Democrats. Since Corcoran’s Watchdog PAC released the ad in late January, it's been aired hundreds of times on Fox News channels and garnered more than 30,000 views on YouTube. The 30-second video features a white woman walking down the streets of a suburban neighborhood when a supposed illegal immigrant, dressed in jeans and a hooded jacket, turns around to shoot her. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com Corcoran says the situation mirrors the fatal shooting of Kate Steinle, who was shot in July 2015 while walking with her father on a San Francisco pier. Jose Ines Garcia Zarate, an undocumented immigrant, was charged with the crime. Prosecutors argued that Zarate intentionally killed Steinle. But, Garcia Zarate’s lawyers argued that her death was unintentional. They said Garcia Zarate, a homeless man, found and picked up a cloth-wrapped gun and that it accidentally fired, the shot ricocheting and traveling about 78 feet before hitting Steinle in the back. He was acquitted of murder and involuntary manslaughter charges in December 2017, but Republicans, including President Donald Trump, cite the case when criticizing sanctuary city policies throughout the nation. "This could have happened to any family, anywhere," Corcoran says in the voice-over. "Incredibly, some Tallahassee politicians want to make Florida a sanctuary state." We wanted to sort out Corcoran’s claim that some Tallahassee politicians support statewide sanctuary-city policies. There is no specific legal definition of sanctuary cities, but the term generally describes jurisdictions that to some extent limit their cooperation with federal immigration officials. Typically, these cities don't honor federal requests to detain illegal immigrants in their custody who they would otherwise release. These policies are generally set at the local levels and are enacted by police department and sheriff’s offices. Watchdog PAC’s communication director Taylor Budowich gave PolitiFact Florida a factsheet for the ad. It included two news articles. One was about Tallahassee Mayor Andrew Gillum and the other was about Democratic lawmakers who introduced legislation in 2017 that would have protected sanctuary cities in Florida. We’ve looked at whether Gillum wants to make Florida a sanctuary state before and we rated it Half True. We found that the claim was extrapolated from Gillum's vows to fight back against Trump's attack on sanctuary cities. Budowich also pointed to a news article which talked about Gillum’s response to President Donald Trump’s January 2017 executive order to penalize cities that don't comply with federal immigration agents by withholding federal funds. After the executive order was announced, Gillum took to Twitter and posted a lengthy statement to attack Trump’s decision as "inconsistent with our highest values," adding the United States can "protect national security interests and have a secure border without criminalizing people who are here undocumented." Gillum’s campaign said as governor he would support an approach like in Tallahassee that emphasizes immigration enforcement as a federal responsibility, not a local one. But Gillum has not offered a specific statewide policy for not cooperating with detainer requests from immigration enforcement officials, so his position is murkier than what Corcoran’s is describing. "Mayor Gillum regularly talks about how illegal immigrants should not be ‘criminalized’ based on being in the country illegally," Budowich said. "So, call it sanctuary cities or wholesale amnesty, it's equally as wrong and defies the rule of law." As for the other Tallahassee politicians, the factsheet cites a 2017 bill (HB 1407) that was sponsored by Rep. Carlos Guillermo Smith, D-Orlando, and Rep. Al Jacquet, D-Lantana. The bill died in the Criminal Justice subcommittee in May, but it would have prohibited local law enforcement officials from "making an inquiry or recording information concerning the immigration status of certain persons." In the article, Smith explained that the bill was meant to garner trust between local law enforcement and sanctuary communities. "This important legislation strengthens those critical local relationships and creates trust to keep all of our communities safe," Smith said in the piece. One final note. The ad implies that undocumented immigrants could murder a family member "any family, anywhere." There is no national database or study tracking how many people have been killed by undocumented immigrants or the nationality of the victims, but numerous studies have found that immigrants are not more likely to commit crimes than U.S.-born citizens. Our ruling Corcoran said, "some Tallahassee politicians want to make Florida a sanctuary state." Corcoran’s ad was referring to Gillum and Democratic politicians, who sponsored legislation in support of sanctuary cities. Gillum was critical of Trump’s executive order threatening to suspend funding, but he has not offered a specific statewide policy for not cooperating with detainer requests from immigration enforcement officials. Last year, Florida Democrats sponsored legislation that emphasized immigration enforcement as a federal responsibility, not a local one, but that bill died in committees.

pomt-13606	"50% of Hispanic students count on Pell Grants to pay for college."	true	/texas/statements/2016/aug/15/ruben-hinojosa/texas-democrat-says-half-hispanic-college-students/	Proposed education appropriations legislation from the Republican-controlled U.S. House would cut Pell Grant funding in fiscal 2017 by $1.3 billion to $21.1 billion. Despite the overall funding cut, Pell Grant maximum amounts are due to rise in the 2016-2017 award year to $5,815 from $5,775 in the 2015-2016 award year. Pell Grants, started by Congress in 1972, are awarded to financially needy students who haven’t yet earned a bachelor’s or professional degree. The proposed funding "cut" is because some -- like Rep. Tom Cole, R-Okla., who chairs the House subcommittee that drafted the legislation -- says the Pell Grant program has been running a surplus for years and that money would be better spent elsewhere. Yet the proposal drew rebukes from education groups and more than 100 Democratic members of Congress. While there is a $7.7 billion surplus in Pell dollars, Kelly McManus of the Education Trust, a Washington-based group focused on academic achievement by students that has registered opposition to the proposed reductions, said that money should be devoted to providing grants to more students. Opponents of the proposed cuts include retiring U.S. Rep. Ruben Hinojosa, D-Mercedes, who tweeted in June 2016: "50% of Hispanic students count on Pell Grants to pay for college: 1.usa.gov/1WNY90D #ProtectPell https://twitter.com/USRepRHinojosa/status/743577402299777024" We wondered if Hinojosa got it right that half of Hispanic students lean on Pell Grants for college. Emails to his office went unanswered. But a web search led us to a 2011 report by Mark Kantrowitz, author of "The Distribution of Grants and Scholarships by Race," a report tracking Pell Grant distributions by race and ethnicity based on data collected for 2003-04 and 2007-08 about how students and their families paid for postsecondary education. According to the U.S. Department of Education, the National Postsecondary Student Aid Study (NPSAS) is conducted every three to four years by the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES), which draws on administrative records plus parent and student interviews At the time of Hinojosa’s tweet, Kantrowitz told us by email, the most recent available data were from 2011-2012. Otherwise, Kantrowitz advised, data covering 2015-16 will available in 2017. So, what do the latest numbers show about the share of Hispanic students getting Pell grants? According to the 2011-2012 NPSAS data, 50 percent of Hispanic undergraduates received a Pell Grant that year; the average award to those students was $3,500. At our request, Kantrowitz did his own analysis of the 2011-2012 counts of grant recipients using race/ethnicity -- setting aside foreign students -- and looking at all recipients of a federal Pell Grant during 2011-2012. Kantrowitz told us: "50.8% of students in the Hispanic or Latino category received federal Pell Grants, compared with 33.7% of students in the White category and 62.7% of students in the Black or African American category. If I group together all the minority students, 53.7% of minority students received Pell Grants." In recent years, the share of Hispanic students drawing the grants has surged, according to a custom report compiled by the National Center for Education Statistics for PolitiFact that showed Hispanics, excluding Puerto Rico, had sat in the mid- to high-20s for percent with Pell Grants through the 1990s. The biggest jump was between 2007-2008 and 2011-2012, when the number of Hispanics receiving the grants increased from 35.7 percent to the 50 percent mark. Wondering why the percentage of Hispanic students getting grants has surged, we reached out to Deborah A. Santiago with Excelencia in Education, a D.C.-based nonprofit organization that says it "accelerates Latino student success in higher education." Santiago said by email that the increase in Hispanic students receiving grants tracks with a 30 percent increase in Hispanic enrollment in higher education between 2008 and 2012. That spurt, Santiago said, included a 4 percent uptick in Hispanic enrollment in four-year institutions, which are typically more costly to attend than two-year schools. Santiago agreed too that the Great Recession helps explain the increase "since incomes decreased and more who could not find jobs enrolled in higher education," she said. And did other ethnic groups experience similar spikes? Black students did. Per the NSPAS data, nearly 62 percent of such students got grants in 2011-12 compared with 46 percent in 2007-2008. The figures show that in 2011-2012, 33.5 percent of white students received Pell Grants valued at an average of $3,300, while 61.9 percent of black undergraduates received Pell Grants at an average of $3,400 per scholarship. About 34 percent of Asian/Pacific Islander undergraduates had Pell Grants at an average of $3,800 each -- but they also had the highest average price of attendance at $20,000. But Hispanic Pell Grant recipients had the lowest rate of student loans, with only 50.1 percent having student loans compared to 64.7 percent of white Pell Grant recipients and 65.8 percent of black grant holders. Our ruling Hinojosa said "50% of Hispanic students count on Pell Grants to pay for college." According to federal figures, 50 percent of Hispanic undergraduates received the grants for 2011-2012, the latest year for which figures were available. We rate this statement True.

pomt-03236	Many uninsured Americans are "young."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2013/aug/16/rand-paul/rand-paul-says-young-people-are-major-part-uninsur/	During a recent appearance on The Daily Show, guest host John Oliver and Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., engaged in a lively exchange on health insurance. In the interview, Paul said many of the uninsured are young people. Paul, an eye surgeon, strongly opposed President Barack Obama’s health care law. During the interview, Oliver pressed him on how to get more Americans signed up for insurance. Paul told Oliver that according to the most recent statistics, "85 percent of people had insurance, so 15 percent didn't. So what you need to do is look at who are the 15 percent, and why don't they have insurance? Of the 15 percent who didn't have insurance, half of them made more than $50,000 a year. Why didn't they buy insurance? Because of the expense. They were young healthy people." In this item, we’ll check whether the uninsured are predominantly young. In separate items, we’ll look at whether cost of insurance is the biggest barrier to uninsured Americans and whether half of the uninsured made more than $50,000 a year. We’ll start by noting that it’s tricky to interpret Paul’s phrasing. One interpretation is that he said uninsured Americans making at least $50,000 are primarily young. Another is that he means that uninsured Americans are disproportionately young, regardless of income level. We didn't get an answer from Paul's staff about which of these he had intended, so we’ll look at both scenarios. Before doing that, we’ll note that the age of uninsured Americans is important because young people have particular insurance needs that are distinct from those of middle-aged and older Americans. Since young people tend to be healthy, they are more likely to be tempted by the option of not buying insurance, particularly if they do not work for a company that offers subsidized insurance. Many young people are averse to paying for the kind of comprehensive coverage attractive to middle-aged Americans and those with families, since young, healthy people aren’t necessarily going to the doctor very often. And this makes it harder to devise policies that push younger people into buying insurance. As Paul put it in the interview, "They don't need low deductibles. They need very high deductibles. They need insurance for catastrophes, because young people are unlikely to get ill. They need it for the rare occasion, not the everyday occasion." Are higher-income uninsured Americans mostly young? According to Census Bureau data, uninsured Americans with family incomes above $50,000 break down as follows: Children up to 18: 17 percent of all uninsured Americans with incomes above $50,000 Ages 19 to 29: 27 percent of all uninsured Americans with incomes above $50,000 Ages 30-39: 17 percent of all uninsured Americans with incomes above $50,000 Ages 40-64: 38 percent of all uninsured Americans with incomes above $50,000 (Anyone 65 and older automatically gets Medicare and thus cannot be uninsured. This census data was calculated and provided to PolitiFact by the liberal Center for Budget and Policy Priorities.) So about one-quarter of the better-off uninsured are age 19 to 29 -- the age range most people probably think of when they hear the phrase "young" in the context of health insurance. Using a broader age range -- from 19 to 39 -- the share rises to 44 percent. That’s a significant percentage, but it’s short of a majority. Are uninsured Americans overall mostly young? Here’s how uninsured Americans break down by age, according to a Kaiser Family Foundation analysis of Census Bureau data: Age 0-18: 15.9 percent of all uninsured Americans Age 19-25: 17.3 percent of all uninsured Americans Age 26-34: 21.4 percent of all uninsured Americans Age 35-44: 17.5 percent of all uninsured Americans Age 45-54: 16.4 percent of all uninsured Americans Age 55-64: 11.5 percent of all uninsured Americans So, the percentage of the uninsured who are between ages 19 and 25 is 17.3 percent, while the percentage of the uninsured who are between 19 and 34 is 38.7 percent. That means that "young" Americans comprise a significant minority of the uninsured population, though still not a majority. That said, younger people are statistically more likely to be uninsured than either children or middle-aged Americans. Here are the percentages of people in specific age ranges who are uninsured: Age 0-18: 9.7 percent of people in this age range are uninsured Age 19‐25: 27.9 percent of people in this age range are uninsured Age 26‐34: 27.8 percent of people in this age range are uninsured Age 35‐44: 21.2 percent of people in this age range are uninsured Age 45‐54: 17.9 percent of people in this age range are uninsured Age 55‐64: 14.6 percent of people in this age range are uninsured In other words, if you’re a young person, you are more likely to be uninsured than children or middle-aged Americans are. However, if you look at uninsured Americans in the big picture, young people are not the biggest part. Children and middle-aged Americans, combined, account for a larger share of the uninsured population. Our ruling Paul said that many uninsured Americans are "young." He’s right that significant numbers of young people lack insurance, and that young people are statistically more likely to be uninsured than either children or middle-aged Americans are. However, it’s worth noting that within the universe of uninsured Americans, young people are not close to a majority. Collectively, children and the middle-aged account for a greater share of the uninsured. On balance, we rate Paul’s comment Mostly True.

pomt-11963	"The crowd (in Las Vegas) fled at the sound of gunshots. Imagine the deaths if the shooter had a silencer ..."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2017/oct/04/hillary-clinton/no-gun-silencers-wouldnt-have-worsened-las-vegas-s/	In the wake of the Las Vegas shooting, Hillary Clinton suggested gun silencers could have amplified the bloodshed. "The crowd fled at the sound of gunshots. Imagine the deaths if the shooter had a silencer, which the NRA wants to make easier to get," Clinton tweeted. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com A silencer is the popular name for a suppressor, a canister attached to a gun muzzle that reduces (but doesn’t entirely silence) the sound produced by a gunshot. Some members of Congress have been pushing for legislation that would make it easier for gun owners to use suppressors. The Hearing Protection Act, introduced in the House of Representatives in January, would lower the restrictions on buying suppressors. As it stands, there is an approximately nine-month approval process and a $200 tax stamp. Act proponents want to streamline purchases to match regular firearm purchases. We wondered whether introducing suppressors to the Las Vegas shooting would have indeed increased casualties. Our research shows that a suppressor would not have made a difference in the Las Vegas case, because of the positioning of the weapons and because of the distance of the shooter from the crowd. Clinton’s staff provided no evidence to suggest a different outcome. How much quieter would it have been? A shooting weapon produces two sounds. One is the crack of the bullet, which can be heard on most video recordings of the shooting and is produced by the bullet traveling faster than the speed of sound. This is unaffected by suppressors. Suppressors instead work on the muzzle blast, or the sound the gun barrel produces when it fires. A typical gunshot is around 150-160 decibels, a level that can cause hearing damage. Suppressors can reduce that sound by around 20-30 decibels, depending on the gun, ammunition, temperature and even humidity. That’s just below the threshold for instant hearing damage. Experts compared the suppressed sound levels to a jackhammer and a jumbo jet on the tarmac 100 yards away. That’s still fairly loud. It’s important to note that suppressors are intended to lower the sound for the shooter, not the target. Jeremy Mallette, who has researched suppressors for Silencer Shop, estimated the sound of suppressed gunfire would go up 10 to 15 decibels downrange -- making the impact of the suppressor even lower for those on the receiving end. Could it have helped in locating the shooter? The gunman shot at the crowd out of windows on the 32nd floor of the hotel and positioned the guns so that they shot outwards. If the shooter’s aim was to lower the sound emissions, the room could have better trapped the noise, according to Tom Satterly, the director of development for Asymmetric Solutions, a firearm training firm based in Missouri. "If you hang your weapon outside of your window the muzzle blast is going outside," Satterly said. "If you back in -- a foot or farther -- a lot of that sound is absorbed into the room. That’s what snipers do when they’re trying to hide their position." Suppressed or not, Mallette said adjacent hotel rooms would have heard the sound very loudly. Marty Langley, a gun-control advocate and a senior policy analyst at Violence Policy Center, pointed to claims from the silencer industry that if the suppressor masks the sound of the gunshot, then the person being shot at can only hear the ballistic crack after it has whizzed by, causing them to think the fire is coming from the opposite direction. However, Satterly, an Army veteran with combat experience in Somalia, said that neither he nor his colleagues had ever been able to pinpoint the direction the sound originated from -- an effect that is amplified in a loud, urban area like the Las Vegas strip. "It’s nearly impossible to tell where someone shot you from in an urban environment unless there’s visual cues," Satterly said. Which brings us to our next point: Langley also pointed out claims from the industry that silencers make shooters less detectable in the dark. The flash hider that comes with a silencer is designed to minimize the flame the shooter sees coming out of the barrel, which can blind night vision goggles for a couple of seconds. But while it minimizes the flash, it doesn’t eliminate it altogether. What’s more, it’s a function that can be performed by tools that are already on the market without the same barriers to purchase as suppressors -- and that many rifles are already equipped with. Langley also pointed out industry claims that silencers can improve accuracy and enable quicker follow-up shots by reducing recoil. That is, they can decrease the barrel’s rising produced by the pressure and gas of the bullet. Experts agreed a suppressor can slightly improve accuracy, but the effect would have been minimal in the indiscriminate shooting seen in Las Vegas. Our ruling Hillary Clinton suggested gun silencers would have worsened the Las Vegas attack in a tweet. It’s certainly possible that silencers or suppressors could make some shootings worse than they would be otherwise. But the specifics of the Las Vegas shooting don’t fit that scenario. Experts told us it’s highly unlikely a silencer would have made the Las Vegas shooting even more deadly, because of the distance of the shooter from the crowds and because of the crowded, urban environment where the victims were targeted. Gun silencers can slightly lower the visual and sound impact of a shooter, but experts agreed the impact would have been negligible in the case of Las Vegas. We rate this statement False. Clarification: After this report was published, we added language to clarify that Langley was pointing to industry claims about the characteristics of suppressors.

pomt-04481	"When Congressman Langevin took office, gas was around $1.70 per gallon, and now it is near $4 per gallon."	mostly false	/rhode-island/statements/2012/oct/08/michael-riley/michael-riley-blames-rep-james-langevin-helping-ga/	It's an informal tradition in politics that if you're running for national office, you blame the incumbent for everything except the weather. (Although in these days of debate over climate change, the weather might be an issue of contention as well.) Republican Michael Riley followed that tradition in a Sept. 30, 2012, news release attacking incumbent U.S. Rep. James Langevin, a Democrat. Headlined "Langevin Does Nothing to Lower the Price of Gas in Rhode Island," it blames Langevin for taking votes that led to higher gasoline prices, such as opposing "completion of the Keystone Pipeline." (For the record, the pipeline, even if it had been approved as proposed in 2008, wasn't going to be completed until 2013, so it would have had no effect on current gasoline prices.) "When Congressman Langevin took office, gas was around $1.70 per gallon, and now it is near $4 per gallon," the Riley release says, contending elsewhere in the statement that Langevin is "in part" to blame. First, we checked Riley's numbers. According to the Rhode Island Office of Energy Resources, when Langevin took office on Jan. 8, 2001, the average price of a gallon of self-service gasoline was about $1.54. The Bureau of Labor Statistics pegs the January 2001 price at $1.53. That's not $1.70. Riley got that wrong. On Sept. 30, 2012, when Riley issued his news release, the Rhode Island price was about $3.93, nearly $4, as the candidate said. He got that part right. When looking at claims such as this, we also ask ourselves whether it's accurate to ascribe blame. Riley says in his news release that Langevin is partly to blame because of his energy votes. We called and e-mailed the Riley campaign on Oct. 2 to find out how much blame he was talking about. We asked: "How much responsibility does Langevin bear for the gas prices going from $1.70 when he took office to close to $4 now? 100%? 50%? 10%? 1%? 0.1%?" We never got a response. In fact, oil is a world commodity and gasoline prices are influenced by a wide variety of factors beyond the control of a single politician, and Langevin is one of 535 voting members of Congress. The impact of the pipeline, to cite one of Riley's issues, is debatable. While the company behind the project has said it would reduce prices by 3.5 to 4 cents per gallon, a March Business Week story concluded that building the pipeline wouldn't bring down gasoline prices. Another analysis predicted that the pipeline could actually raise prices by 10 cents per gallon. Analysts whom PolitiFact and other news organizations have consulted over the years have repeatedly said that office holders, including the president, have little impact on gasoline prices at any particular time. Our ruling Michael Riley blames Rep. James Langevin "in part" for skyrocketing gasoline prices, saying, "When Congressman Langevin took office, gas was around $1.70 per gallon, and now it is near $4 per gallon." Langevin was first elected to Congress nearly a dozen years ago, when the price was closer to $1.53, not $1.70. But Langevin's role in the global oil and gasoline market is so small to be almost inconsequential. Because Riley's statement contains some element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression, we rate it Mostly False.

A group called Liberals Are Cool applied that term in an Internet meme - an idea or concept shared via social media - to six well-known Republicans – Mitt Romney, Donald Trump, Dick Cheney, Ted Nugent, Rush Limbaugh and Bill O’Reilly. "Q: What do these ‘Patriotic Americans’ have in common? A: They are all Draft Dodgers," according to the meme received March 17 by PolitiFact New Jersey. Draft dodging is a serious accusation, but in Liberals Are Cool’s case, theirs lacks any shred of accuracy. Let’s explain how the draft worked during the Vietnam era, which the Selective Service System defines as August 1964 through December 1972. Men who received a draft notice in the mail had about three weeks to return paperwork requesting a hearing for a deferment, Selective Service System spokesman Pat Schuback said. A local draft board then decided whether to grant the waiver. "For the Vietnam war and World War II, any time there was a draft, there were classifications of deferments," Schuback said. "If you were eligible for it, you were entitled to claim that deferment." That’s what happened to the men targeted by Liberals are Cool, according to military classification histories that the Selective Service System shared with us, as well as other public records and published reports. The six each applied for and received education deferments because they were students when their names came up for military service. Romney also received a religious deferment during the time he was doing Mormon missionary work. Romney and Trump also had very high draft numbers, meaning that although they were eligible for military service, their numbers were never called. The first draft lottery for Vietnam occurred on Dec. 1, 1969. Cheney received an additional deferment when he became a father. A federal law at the time exempted a parent from military service for reasons of "extreme hardship on dependents." Schuback didn’t have Nugent’s and O’Reilly’s classification histories available but numerous published reports – including ones from Snopes.com and TheSmokingGun.com indicate that both received education deferments. Both websites use public documents for fact-checking. Limbaugh and Nugent were ultimately disqualified from service for medical reasons, according to Snopes.com and TheSmokingGun.com. Education deferments were not unusual, Schuback noted. In fact, millions of Americans received them. During the Vietnam era there were 26,800,000 men in the United States. Of those, 2,215,000 were drafted. The number of deferments during that time was 1,541,000 – more than 50 percent of the population eligible for military service, according to the book "I Want You! The Evolution of the All-Volunteer Force," by Bernard D. Rostker that was put out by the RAND Corporation. So what is a ‘draft dodger’? It’s not someone who received a legitimate and legal deferment from military service, Schuback said. "A draft dodger is someone who got drafted and has then fled, or it also might be a person who made a statement by not registering (for the draft)," he explained. "I’m not a draft dodger," Schuback added, citing himself as an example. "I got a deferment because I was pursuing a college degree. Calling that a draft dodger is not correct. They can use it a different way but it’s not correct." Liberals Are Cool did not respond to our request for comment. Our ruling A Liberals Are Cool meme claims "Q: What do these ‘Patriotic Americans’ have in common? A: They are all Draft Dodgers," referring to Romney, Trump, Cheney, Limbaugh, Nugent and O’Reilly. Liberals Are Cool doesn’t acknowledge that the six registered properly for the draft, then applied for and received legal deferments so they could complete their education – an opportunity given more than half the men eligible for the U.S. draft during the Vietnam era. Liberals Are Cool may not like that these men didn’t face combat, but calling them ‘draft dodgers’ is wrong – and ridiculous. As a result, we’re cranking up the heat for this ruling: Pants on Fire!

pomt-11796	"The elimination of income and sales taxes in New York is equal to 9 percent of taxable income, meaning that if you make $100,000 a year you lose $9,000"	false	/new-york/statements/2017/nov/20/brian-higgins/not-all-state-and-local-tax-deductions-eliminated-/	Rep. Brian Higgins, D-Buffalo, claimed the House Republican tax reform bill could slash middle-class incomes as much as 9 percent. New York state taxpayers would lose money if Congress decides to end the federal deduction of state and local taxes, he said. "The elimination of income and sales taxes in New York is equal to 9 percent of taxable income, meaning that if you make $100,000 a year you lose $9,000," Higgins said at a hearing. "If you make $50,000 a year, you lose $4,500." About 3.3 million people in New York state take advantage of the state and local tax deduction, according to the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center, a tax policy and research organization. More than half of those who take the deduction make $100,000 a year or less. Is Higgins right that those taxpayers could lose as much as $9,000? Explaining the SALT deduction The current tax code allows taxpayers to deduct their state and local taxes from their federal taxes. About one-third of filers do this in New York state. That helps residents in states like New York where property taxes are higher. Filers can also deduct either their state income tax or sales tax, but not both. The House Republican tax plan would cap the maximum property tax deduction at $10,000 and end the deduction for state income and sales tax altogether. About two-thirds of filers choose instead to take the standard deduction, a fixed amount set each year. Where’s the number from? What Higgins said is different from what he meant to say, said Theresa Kennedy, the congressman’s spokeswoman. He meant to say filers would no longer be able to deduct $9,000 -- not lose $9,000 outright. Higgins supports that claim with data from the Government Finance Officers Association. The group said the average state and local tax deduction in New York state is equal to 9 percent of a filer's income. That's where Higgins get the $9,000 figure from. Nine percent of $100,000 is $9,000. That’s in the ballpark. People making between $75,000 and $100,000 deduct $9,949 on average in state and local taxes, according to data from the Tax Policy Center. "How much they'll actually save depends on the tax rate," said Frank Sammartino, a senior fellow at the center. Couples making $100,000 are currently taxed at 25 percent. That wouldn’t change under the Republican plan. A $9,000 tax deduction could save that couple $2,250 in tax, according to the IRS. One caveat Even if Higgins had said deduction in his statement, he would still be wrong. Higgins made his claim after House Republicans decided to keep the deduction for property taxes. The deduction would be capped at $10,000. If someone’s property tax bill is more than that amount, the difference could not be deducted. The Senate bill does not include that proposal. Sammartino said Higgins’ claim would hold up if there isn’t a compromise. "Nine thousand would be true if it was a complete repeal," Sammartino said. "But it would be something less than that" with the deduction for property taxes. The average property tax deduction is $6,522 for someone making between $75,000 and $100,000 in New York. That falls below the cap. "People would be protected to some degree," Sammartino said. Kennedy, the spokeswoman for Higgins, said the bill still affects residents in his district, regardless of the final numbers. "We can debate the exact numbers which will be different for each taxpayer, but the bottom line is that hardworking Western New Yorkers have a lot to lose in both the Senate and House legislation which continues to change by the minute," Kennedy said. Our ruling Higgins said New York state taxpayers could lose as much as 9 percent of their taxable income if state and local tax deductions end. Higgins meant to say residents would no longer be able to deduct 9 percent of their income from their federal taxes, not that they would lose that money outright. But even if he said what he meant, that would still be inaccurate. House Republicans came to a compromise on property tax deductions that refute the numbers in his statement. We rate the claim False.

pomt-11460	"China, my understanding is, supplies 4 percent of the steel in the U.S."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2018/mar/08/angus-king/does-much-steel-does-us-import-china/	President Donald Trump said his administration would slap tariffs on steel and aluminum imports to the United States, the latest in a series of moves to reorder the country’s trade arrangements along lines Trump believes are more favorable to American interests. The Trump administration has long criticized China for flooding the U.S. market with cheap commodities, and the 25 percent tariff on steel and 10 percent tariff on aluminum Trump announced March 1 seemed calculated in part to rein in what the administration considers unfair Chinese trade practices. But some critics, like Sen. Angus King, I-Maine, have charged that a steel tariff would do more harm to U.S. allies like Canada, and American small businesses, than it would do to China. Following Trump’s announcement, King said he heard complaints from constituents who run steel-reliant small businesses. King said one business owner reported an 8 percent increase in steel costs, and another worried about cost increases on steel imported from a nearby Canadian partner. While Trump may have a point about unfair trade practices, King said, Beijing would hardly bear the brunt of an import tax on steel, given its relatively small U.S. market share. "China, my understanding is, supplies 4 percent of the steel in the U.S," King said during a March 4 interview on NBC’s Meet the Press. So how much does China account for U.S. steel imports? We decided to mine for answers. Transshipment of Chinese steel Measuring U.S. steel imports by country is not as straightforward as it might seem. The American steel industry has argued that China has a backdoor to U.S. markets through a practice known as transshipment, whereby countries buy Chinese steel and modify it before exporting to the United States. Trump drew attention to this practice during March 6 remarks at the White House. "If you talk China, I’ve watched where the reporters have been writing 2 percent of our steel comes from China. Well, that’s not right. They transship all through other countries," Trump said. "It doesn’t look good when it all comes out of China, so they send it through other countries, and it comes to us. And it’s putting our steel mills out of business." Experts we spoke to said there’s no hard data on transshipment, which makes the scale of this practice difficult to gauge. Edward Alden, a fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations, noted the Commerce Department was unable to quantify the problem in a recent investigation — known as a Section 232 report — that probed the effect of steel and aluminum imports on U.S. national security. The report said only that an "unknown portion" of Chinese steel is further processed in third-party countries before entering the United States. "It’s at least fair to say that the president is making a strong claim without solid evidence to back that claim up," he said. Alden added that the biggest targets of Trump's steel tariff would be the European Union, Japan, Brazil, Canada, Mexico and Korea. (The White House is reportedly considering granting an exemption Canada and Mexico.) "Except for Korea," he said, "none of the others seems to be a transshipment concern." Gary Clyde Hufbauer, a fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, said the amount of Chinese steel that enters the United States through transshipment is not enough to call into question the reliability of the Commerce Department’s import data. He also pushed back on how Trump characterized transshipment. "China sells raw and semi-finished steel to other countries, which then make more highly valued products. (But Trump's use of) the word 'transshipment' implied that the same piece of metal arrives, for example, in Veracruz and then is shipped to Houston with no transformation," Hufbauer said. "This is Trump’s imagination." So let’s set the issue of transshipment to one side and focus on the steel products the Trump administration has eyed for tariffs. According to Chad P. Bown, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, the only steel imports subject to Trump's proposed tariffs are those which have been identified by the Commerce Department. The department measures U.S. steel imports in two ways: quantity and U.S. dollar value. Under each yardstick, China’s share is relatively small. China's share of U.S. steel imports In terms of quantity, China accounts for just over 2 percent of U.S. steel imports, according to 2017 data. That’s far behind traditional U.S. allies like Canada (roughly 18 percent), the European Union (about 21 percent) and South Korea (nearly 10 percent). Expressed another way, the United States imported 740,126 tons of steel from China last year, compared to nearly 5.7 million tons from Canada and just over 5 million tons from European Union countries. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com China’s share is slightly larger in terms of dollar value, but still relatively small. The United States imported just shy of $1 billion in Chinese steel in 2017, or 3.35 percent of the United States’ nearly $30 billion annual steel import market, according to Commerce Department data. See Figure 2 on PolitiFact.com An aide to King pointed us to an interview with Bown, of the Peterson Institute, from September 2017, in which Bown said 4 percent of U.S. imports of steel come from China. But its proportion of U.S. steel imports, relative to other countries, has shrunk since then. In any case, he wasn’t too far off China’s 3.35 percent market share in 2017, in terms of dollar value. Experts largely backed up his broader point about the limited impact of steel tariffs on China. "The numbers show that the tariffs will hurt trading partners — which are allies — much more than China," said Mac Destler, a professor of public policy at the University of Maryland. Tom Orlik, chief Asia economist at Bloomberg in Beijing, wrote that China’s total exports of steel and aluminum are equal to about 0.5 percent of GDP, with most of that from steel. "Relative to fears from Trump’s campaign trail rhetoric, in which he threatened an across-the-board 45 percent tariff on all imports from China, these measures are extremely limited," Orlik wrote of Trump’s proposed tariffs. Our ruling King said, "China, my understanding is, supplies 4 percent of the steel in the U.S." There are different ways to measure U.S. steel imports by country. In terms of dollar value, Chinese steel made up 3.35 percent of the United States’ nearly $30 billion annual steel import market in 2017. But in terms of quantity, China accounted for just over 2 percent of U.S. steel imports that year. King’s claim tracks closely to one of two measures. But in either case, King does not stray too far from the Commerce Department’s 2017 data. We rate this Mostly True.

pomt-00868	"Here, we have Thanksgiving, we have Christmas, we have the 4th of July. Every year in Iran, they celebrate Death to America day."	mostly false	/texas/statements/2015/mar/13/ted-cruz/ted-cruz-says-iran-annually-has-death-america-holi/	Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, expressed concerns about Iran coming closer to having nuclear weapons should the United States reach a deal permitting Iran to have nuclear fuel. Problematically, Cruz said, President Barack Obama’s administration doesn’t recognize the religious zealotry of Iran’s leaders. Talking to conservative commentator Hugh Hewitt, Cruz said that zealotry has been cemented into the country’s calendar. Indeed, Cruz said, "every day, or every year, rather, Iran celebrates as a holiday what they call death to America day. That’s an actual holiday in Iran. Here, we have Thanksgiving, we have Christmas, we have the 4th of July. Every year in Iran, they celebrate death to America day, which is the anniversary of Iran in the 1970s taking Americans hostage." We wondered if there is such a holiday. Cruz’s backup To our inquiry, Cruz spokesman Phil Novack emailed that every November, Iranians celebrate the 1979 takeover of the U.S. Embassy. He pointed out a November 1987 Associated Press news story stating Iran’s leaders had just declared a national holiday to mark the 1979 seizure of the U.S. Embassy in Tehran "and called on their people to take to the streets and make ‘America tremble in fear.’" Tehran Radio had dubbed the special date, Nov. 4, 1987, ''Death to America Day,'' the story said. That date was eight years to the day of students taking over the embassy and holding 52 hostages who remained captives to the end of Jimmy Carter’s presidency in early 1981. The AP story said, too, the date marked the birthday of the Prophet Mohammed, founder of Islam, and the 25th anniversary of Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini's expulsion from Iran to Turkey by the Shah of Iran, who fled in January 1979; weeks later, Khomeini triumphantly returned. More recently, according to an October 2013 New York Times news story also noted by Novack, "hard-liners" in Iran planned to mark Nov. 4, 2013, as a ‘Grand Day of Death to America.’" The same story said, though, the chant "Death to America" was falling out of routine use; Iran’s newly elected president, Hassan Rouhani, was saying the country no longer needed slogans. Other news stories Our search for news stories in the Nexis database yielded a Nov. 1, 2014, news report from BBC Worldwide Monitoring quoting from the "Iranian conservative, privately-owned Fars News Agency website" and saying: "Since the 1979 takeover of the U.S. embassy in Tehran, Iranians have been celebrating the occasion every year by holding rallies on the anniversary and marking it as the National Day against the ‘Global Arrogance.’" Four days later, a BBC summary of programs aired Nov. 4, 2014, by Iranian Fars Province TV news mentioned a video report on "the anniversary of the U.S. embassy takeover in Tehran in 1979 marked on 13 Aban (4 November) dubbed as ‘Day of fighting arrogance.’ Video shows archive footage of the embassy's seizure in Tehran." And The (Glasgow) Herald newspaper printed a photograph Nov. 5, 2014 with this description: "Thousands of Iranians have attended a major anti-U.S. rally marking the anniversary of the 1979 takeover of the U.S. Embassy in Tehran. The gathering outside the former embassy compound came days before a key meeting between the two nations’ senior diplomats over Iran’s nuclear programme. The crowds chanted ‘Down with America’ and ‘Death to Britain,’" the newspaper said. So it seems that at least in Tehran, Nov. 4 is marked every year. Next, we looked for confirmation the anniversary date is a national holiday akin to Christmas or the 4th of July called, as the senator said, Death to America Day. A list of Iranian holidays posted online by Iran’s office in Washington, D.C., doesn’t show a special designation for Nov. 4. But that list might only cover days Iran’s American office is closed. Separately, we spotted a list of public holidays in Iran posted by Columbus Travel Media, a company that describes itself as "dedicated to the provision of objective, accurate, informative and reliable travel content." Its list doesn't show any November holidays in Iran. Academic authorities And when we queried specialists on Iran, they responded there are annual demonstrations marking the 1979 embassy takeover, but the date is not a national holiday nor is it called Death to America Day. Gary Sick, a scholar at Columbia University’s Middle East Institute, said by email "Death to America" is an Iranian revolutionary slogan shouted or chanted "at most events related to the revolution. I am sure that it would be heard at the Nov. 4 demonstrations, but I am unaware that it is the formal name of the day or event. This slogan is shouted every Friday at the weekly prayer services held across Iran." Similarly, Alex Vatanka of the Washington, D.C.-based Middle East Institute, said annual Nov. 4 events are a "regime-orchestrated show of anti-Americanism" and not a national holiday. "That said, the regime's history of spewing anti-Americanism is rich," Vatanka emailed. Mehrzad Boroujerdi, a Syracuse University political scientist, called the claim incorrect, saying by email: "There are celebrations on Nov. 4 which is the anniversary of the takeover of the U.S. Embassy" but "no such thing as a death to America national holiday." John Limbert, a professor at the U.S. Naval Academy and former Iranian hostage, said by email that Nov. 4 "is marked with demonstrations and speeches, although former President" Mohammad "Khatami (1997-2005) limited those events while he was in office. I have never heard it referred to as ‘Death to America’ day. Nor, as far as I am aware, does it have the status of ‘national holiday’ during which presumably offices and schools would be closed." Shahin Gerami, a specialist in Persian Studies at San Jose State University, called us back by phone the annual demonstrations are "highly orchestrated" by Iran’s government, like some such celebrations in Russia, she suggested. Stores, offices and banks don’t close, she said, because it’s not a holiday. She said she’d not previously heard anyone refer to Nov. 4 as Death to America Day. Cruz's response We alerted Cruz’s office to much of what we were hearing. Cruz spokeswoman Amanda Carpenter replied by email that the annual marking of Nov. 4 "fits the working definition of a holiday. St. Patrick’s Day is an upcoming event that most Americans recognize as a holiday, although it is not considered a federal holiday. Just because Iran has not similarly designated 'Death to America Day' as a formalized holiday does not mean Sen. Cruz's characterization was wrong or the occurrence of these routine celebrations is any less disturbing." Our ruling Cruz said that every year, Iran has a holiday like Thanksgiving, Christmas and the 4th of July called Death to America Day. Every year, demonstrations in Tehran mark the Nov. 4 anniversary of students taking over the U.S. embassy in 1979 and taking hostages. But that date doesn’t appear to be akin to the special American days Cruz singled out. In fact, it’s not a holiday on the calendar at all nor is it formally designated Death to America Day.

pomt-10371	"When he was asked a few years ago whether he could see himself lifting the cap on the payroll tax, (McCain) said, 'I could.' But today he's attacking me for holding the very same position."	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/jun/26/barack-obama/mccain-flipped-on-payroll-taxes-if-only-once/	What politicians have said on TV often comes back to haunt them. Sen. John McCain knows that feeling after Sen. Barack Obama recalled a past statement McCain made about Social Security solvency on a Sunday morning news show. In a June 13, 2008, speech to senior citizens in Columbus, Ohio, Obama outlined his plan to require those earning $250,000 or more to contribute more in payroll taxes while keeping all other tax levels constant. Then Obama dropped this line: "There was a time when John McCain thought this wasn't such a bad idea. When he was asked a few years ago whether he could see himself lifting the cap on the payroll tax, he said, 'I could.' But today he's attacking me for holding the very same position." McCain never put specific salary parameters to the issue, but he did tell Tim Russert on a Feb. 20, 2005, edition of Meet the Press that he would consider increasing the Social Security payroll tax to help keep the system solvent. Here's the relevant material from the transcript: Russert: Sen. McCain, there's a big debate in your Republican Party about whether or not, as part of the solution to Social Security's solvency problem, that you lift the cap so that you would pay payroll tax, Social Security tax, not just on the first $90,000 of your income, but perhaps even higher. Could you support that as part of a compromise? Sen McCain: As part of a compromise I could, and other sacrifices, because we all know that it doesn't add up until we make some very serious and fundamental changes. (At the time, the cap stood at $90,000. In January 2008, it rose to the current level of $102,000.) Reacting to Obama's assertion, McCain's advisers told reporters in a June 2008 conference call that he would not "under any imaginable circumstance" consider raising the payroll tax. During the conference call, campaign advisers didn't address McCain's 2005 statement on Meet the Press. Neither McCain's campaign nor the Obama camp returned calls seeking more information. But the record is clear in verifying Obama's statement. We rule it True.	None	Barack Obama	None	None	None	2008-06-26T00:00:00	2008-06-13	['None']
pomt-14538	"It has been 80 years since a Supreme Court vacancy was nominated and confirmed in an election year. There is a long tradition that you don't do this in an election year."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/feb/14/ted-cruz/ted-cruz-supreme-court-nomination-tradition/	Republicans running for president say President Barack Obama should let the next president nominate someone to replace U.S. Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia. Texas Sen. Ted Cruz said on Meet the Press on Feb. 14 that it is a "long tradition" that a president in his final year in office should let his successor fill a spot on the nation’s highest court. Meet the Press Host Chuck Todd asked Cruz if the Senate had an obligation to at least consider a nominee from Obama. Cruz said "not remotely." "It has been 80 years since a Supreme Court vacancy was nominated and confirmed in an election year," Cruz said. "There is a long tradition that you don't do this in an election year." Cruz is correct in that it’s rare for a president to nominate and have confirmed a Supreme Court justice in an election year. But that’s more because of the rarity of filling Supreme Court slots than some "long tradition." The Senate’s list of Supreme Court nominees shows precious few nominees and confirmations in the years when America elects a president. President Lyndon B. Johnson nominated two people in 1968, his final year in office. One would have elevated sitting Justice Abe Fortas to the Chief Justice position vacated by Earl Warren. Fortas hit strong opposition in the Senate Judiciary Committee and in the face of a filibuster, he asked that his name be withdrawn. (The hearings uncovered questionable speaking fees Fortas received, and he resigned from the court in 1969.) Johnson nominated Homer Thornberry in 1968 and was forced to withdraw that nomination, too. So neither Thornberry nor Fortas was nominated and confirmed in the same year. The next election-year nomination was in 1940, when President Franklin D. Roosevelt put forward Frank Murphy on Jan. 4, 1940. The Senate confirmed Murphy 12 days later on Jan. 16, 1940. That took place 76 years ago, not 80 as Cruz said, but it’s pretty close. Cruz chose his qualifying words carefully. By including both nominated and confirmed, he avoided the case of Justice Anthony Kennedy. President Ronald Reagan nominated Kennedy on Nov. 30, 1987, and the Senate confirmed him on Feb. 3, 1988. To be clear, presidents decide when to nominate, and the Senate decides when to confirm. Often, the administration gets a read on where the Senate stands before putting someone forward, but formally, the timing for the first step is up to the person in the Oval Office. The experts we reached did have an issue with Cruz’s use of the word "tradition." "This is entirely a matter of circumstance," said Sarah Binder, a political scientist at George Washington University. "Certainly not a norm or tradition by presidents refraining from nominating in a presidential election year or by senators refusing to consider such nominations." In Cruz’s 80-year time frame, there were only two instances when vacancies coincided with presidential elections -- 1940 and 1968 as we just mentioned. Both times, the sitting presidents nominated a replacement. Going back further, there were opportunities in 1932, two in 1916, and one in 1912. In every one of those cases, the president nominated someone and the Senate voted to confirm. Editor Amy Howe wrote on SCOTUS Blog, "The historical record does not reveal any instances since at least 1900 of the president failing to nominate and/or the Senate failing to confirm a nominee in a presidential election year because of the impending election." Russell Wheeler is an expert on the courts at the Brookings Institution and former deputy director of the Federal Judicial Center. Wheeler told us that in the post-WWII period, the limited opportunities for election-year nominations lies primarily with the justices who exercise the choice to step down. "Justices rarely leave active service in an election year, because they know, at least in the modern era of contentious confirmation battles, that their colleagues will be short staffed because of the unlikelihood of an election-year confirmation of a successor," Wheeler said. "Justices in the modern era rarely die in office." Since the end of World War II, only four justices, including Scalia, died while serving. Wheeler said Scalia is the only justice who died in a presidential election year. Our ruling Cruz said there’s a long tradition stretching back 80 years of not nominating and confirming a Supreme Court justice in an election year. A Supreme Court justice hasn’t been both nominated and confirmed in a presidential election year since 1940, 76 years ago. But the notion that this is a "long tradition," is misguided. The fact is, vacancies in an election year are rare, especially in Cruz’s time frame. As such, it’s hard to argue that there is any tradition in filling seats. Cruz’s statement is partially accurate but takes things out of context. We rate it Half True.	None	Ted Cruz	None	None	None	2016-02-14T16:16:04	2016-02-14	['None']
pomt-05306	On the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP)	no flip	/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/may/18/mitt-romney/did-mitt-romney-flip-flop-tarp/	The Troubled Asset Relief Program -- the "TARP" program that was supposed to stabilize the financial markets -- has not been popular with conservatives. During the Republican presidential primary, most candidates attacked it. But the Democratic National Committee says Mitt Romney has flip-flopped on it. On Nov. 28, 2011, the DNC released two videos -- a 30-second version and a four-minute version -- that said Romney flipped on several issues, including TARP. About three minutes into the four-minute version, the word "TARP" appears on screen. Then Romney is shown in a split-screen view with Fox News’ Neil Cavuto. "TARP got paid back and it kept the financial system from collapsing," Romney says. "So you feel it was well worth it?" Cavuto asks. "Well, it was the right thing to do," Romney answers. Cut to another video clip, and we hear Romney say, "TARP ought to be ended." Rewind, then again, "TARP ought to be ended." Sounds contradictory, right? We checked it out. We’ll start by noting that the Flip-O-Meter rates politicians' consistency on particular topics from No Flip to Full Flop. The meter is not intended to pass judgment on their decisions to change their minds. It’s simply gauging whether they did. A fact sheet provided by the DNC tells us the source of the video clips. The first thing to note is that the statement in which Romney appears to support TARP was made after his "ought to be ended" clip. So does that mean Romney was originally against TARP, and then he was for it? Not exactly. We researched what Romney has said about TARP over the last four years and found that his position has largely remained unchanged. • In March 2009, Romney told Reuters, "The TARP program, while not transparent and not having been used as wisely it should have been, was nevertheless necessary to keep banks from collapsing in a cascade of failures. You cannot have a free economy and free market if there is not a financial system. … The TARP program was designed to keep the financial system going, to keep money circulating in the economy, without which the entire economy stops and you would really have an economic collapse." • A December 2009 clip shows how the DNC plucked the "TARP ought to be ended" quotation and distorted his position. His complete statement, in answer to a question by CNN’s John King about how to get the economy going, was, "And by the way, TARP has served its purpose. TARP ought to be ended. We've got hundreds of billions of dollars there that is being used as a slush fund by Secretary (Timothy) Geithner and the Obama administration. Stop the TARP recklessness at this point and get ourselves back to creating jobs by encouraging businesses to grow, expand their capital expenditures and hire." • In January 2010, Romney appeared on Fox and had even more positive things to say about TARP: "That was an investment made to try and keep a collapse of our entire financial system from occurring," • In a Republican primary debate in October 2011, Romney said, "My experience tells me that we were on the precipice, and we could have had a complete meltdown of our entire financial system, wiping out all the savings of the American people. So action had to be taken. Was it perfect? No. Was it well implemented? No, not particularly. Were there some institutions that should not have been bailed out? Absolutely. Should they have used the funds to bail out General Motors and Chrysler? No, that was the wrong source for that funding. But this approach of saying, look, we're going to have to preserve our currency and maintain America -- and our financial system is essential." Our ruling The DNC portrayed Romney as having flip-flopped on his support for TARP. But the statements the DNC chose for the ad echo what Romney has said on the topic all along -- that a Wall Street bailout was necessary to prevent a financial calamity, but the way the money was administered was poor. We rate it No Flip.	None	Mitt Romney	None	None	None	2012-05-18T17:03:31	2011-11-28	['Troubled_Asset_Relief_Program']
pomt-01871	"If you're a Mexican, you get sent back. ... But if you're from a noncontiguous country like the Central American countries" then you can stay in the United States.	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2014/jul/10/henry-cuellar/rep-texas-says-immigrant-minors-countries-dont-bor/	Why are so many children pouring across the southwest U.S. border? The answer is partly U.S. law, said a Texas congressman on CNN’s State of the Union on July 6, 2014. Candy Crowley, CNN’s host, asked Rep. Henry Cuellar, D-Texas, "Why are they coming in such numbers? What do you think prompts these numbers right now?" Cuellar answered, "If you're a Mexican, you get sent back. Mother, kids, adults, you're sent back, but if you're from a noncontiguous country like the Central American countries, then the law says that you are going to be held, (and) Health and Human Services, they're going to place you. That’s the law that we need to change right now." We looked into the claim and found that Cuellar wasn’t crossing any lines. With an influx of about 52,000 child immigrants at the border since October, the conversation has shifted to explanations. Which brings us to the William Wilberforce Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act of 2008. Some have cited it as the catalyst for the increase in illegal immigration. President George W. Bush signed the law on Dec. 23, 2008; it received bipartisan support in both the House and the Senate as a measure to combat human trafficking worldwide. The law was never intended to encourage mass immigration from noncontiguous countries. But the law’s Section 235 did change the policies and procedures for handling unaccompanied alien children. Section 235, entitled "Enhancing Efforts to Combat the Trafficking of Children," requires humane treatment of minors crossing the border from foreign nations. It also mandates "safe and secure placements," calling for careful consideration when placing unaccompanied minors in residences within the United States. The law lays out one procedure for child immigrants from contiguous countries, like Mexico and Canada, and another for children from noncontiguous countries, like El Salvador or Honduras. Child immigrants from contiguous countries are processed for immediate return to their home country. In all other cases, the children are placed under the responsibility of the Secretary of Health and Human Services. These children are placed with family or in other residences while they await their immigration court date. Long story short, they get to stay in the United States. The law seems to assume that alien children from noncontiguous countries were likely to be the victims of human trafficking, and it guarantees these minors access to legal counsel and child advocates. Experts said Cuellar was right, and the law was never intended to allow immigrant children from Central America to remain in the United States. "Representative Cuellar's characterization is mostly right," said Dan Cadman, a fellow at the Center for Immigration Studies. The law "has actually fueled an industry in the smuggling of minors. Contrary to intent, it has proven to be an inducement to wholesale smuggling of minors from noncontiguous countries." The House GOP task force, assembled by speaker John Boehner to address the immigration crisis, issued a statement this week calling for changes to the law. "We agree with the president that (these children) must be returned to their home countries in the most humane way possible and that will require a revision of the 2008 Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act." On July 9, 2014, Cuellar said that he is introducing legislation to make the repatriation of minors from noncontiguous countries easier and faster by revising the law. Our ruling Cuellar said that unaccompanied alien children from contiguous countries are "sent back" no matter what, but the law calls for the placement of minors from "a noncontiguous country like the Central American countries" in a residential setting. Cuellar correctly characterizes the law. The law was passed as a measure to combat human trafficking worldwide. As a result, certain parts of the legislation allow unaccompanied minors from noncontiguous countries to stay in the United States. Lawmakers are now contemplating changing the law. We rate this statement True.	None	Henry Cuellar	None	None	None	2014-07-10T18:17:00	2014-07-06	['United_States', 'Mexico', 'Central_America']
pomt-09175	"For now, we are still below average in the metro region."	true	/georgia/statements/2010/jun/04/francis-kungu/dekalb-water-bills-inexpensive-comparison-region/	DeKalb County water officials made the case to their Board of Commissioners at a May 19 meeting that they need to raise water and sewer rates to pay for the system's aging infrastructure. The argument was the time-honored claim used by elected officials, plumbers and mechanics: We're cheaper than the other guys. "Over the next several years, everybody else will be adjusting rates," said Francis Kung'u, director of the DeKalb County Watershed Management Department. "But for now, we are still below average in the metro region." We were curious about his claim that DeKalb's rates are "below average" and decided to check it out. DeKalb officials gave the commissioners a thick packet of information that included how much money 15 nearby counties and the city of Atlanta charge per month for water and sewer use. DeKalb based its comparison on 6,000 gallons a month. That's the average amount of water homeowners use each month, officials in several areas said. The monthly bill for DeKalb customers who use 6,000 gallons a month is $51.34, county officials said. DeKalb's chart shows the county with about the lowest water and sewer rates among metro counties and Atlanta. So was DeKalb right? We first focused on six of the largest water systems in the metro area: Cherokee, Clayton, Cobb, Fulton and Gwinnett counties and the city of Atlanta. DeKalb is the state's third-highest-populated county. Its Watershed Management Department has a $227 million annual budget, which ranks among the highest in the state. Atlanta's rates were the highest, more than twice the monthly cost of those in DeKalb County. The city approved two sets of rate increases in the past decade to help fund its ongoing $4 billion effort to overhaul its sewer system and improve water quality. The average monthly cost is nearly $121. (Brace yourselves, Atlanta homeowners, the monthly rate is scheduled to rise by an additional 12 percent on July 1.) City officials say Atlanta's rates may be the highest in the nation. The other water systems were more in line with DeKalb. They ranged from Cobb's $53.88 a month to Gwinnett's $69.44 monthly charge for the average customer. We also checked with 10 water and sewer systems in smaller cities and counties that DeKalb used to base its report. Most of them range between $65 to $70 a month. The average monthly charge in Walton County is $44.85, but it doesn't charge for sewer service. Again, the reason DeKalb wants to increase the rates is because its system is getting old. DeKalb's population grew faster than many of its neighbors, thus its infrastructure has more wear and tear. The county has a $1.79 billion repair list. Could that be why DeKalb's rates are lower? Perhaps, said Sally Bethea, executive director of the Upper Chattahoochee Riverkeeper, a group that has monitored Atlanta's efforts to fix its sewer system. "They may have not yet made the kinds of investments Atlanta has made," she said. If you focus solely on the larger counties or all 16 governments that DeKalb studied, the numbers do show DeKalb's rates for the average customer are below the metro average. We rate the county's claim as True.	None	Francis Kung'u	None	None	None	2010-06-04T20:21:53	2010-05-19	['None']
pomt-01124	"We're now the No. 1 producer of oil in the world. We've surpassed Saudi Arabia."	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/jan/04/amy-klobuchar/klobuchar-says-us-worlds-no-1-oil-producer/	Considering the United States’ strength in energy production, the debate over building the Keystone XL pipeline has become a symbolic one, said Sen. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn. On NBC’s Meet the Press on Jan. 4, 2015, Sen. John Barrasso, R-Wyo., said the new Republican Congress’ first priority in 2015 will be to pass a bill approving construction of the oil pipeline, which would stretch from Canada to Steele City, Neb., where it would connect with an existing pipeline that goes to the coast of Texas. Klobuchar responded by saying the project "has merit" but that the decision to build the pipeline should rest with President Barack Obama, not Congress. She said the debate has become a "symbolic" one that ignores America’s healthy energy market. "We're now the no. 1 producer of oil in the world," she said. "We've surpassed Saudi Arabia." We decided to check out the data and see if in fact the United States is the world’s top oil producer. As it turns out, the United States passed over Saudi Arabia about two years ago. According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, which tracks global energy production and consumption statistics, the United States has produced more oil than Saudi Arabia since the fourth quarter of 2012. American oil production surpassed Russia in 2011. Here’s a chart showing the trend from the Energy Information Administration: In the third quarter of 2014 -- the most recent available data -- the United States produced 14.2 million barrels of oil per day; Saudi Arabia produced 11.7 million per day; and Russia produced 10.5 million per day. Together, that’s about 40 percent of total global production. This production growth has contributed to the United States’ ability to produce more oil than it imports for the first time in about 20 years. The Energy Information Administration expects American production to continue to grow in 2015, despite recent lower crude oil prices. Total oil production figures include crude oil, natural gas liquids and other liquid energy products. On top of oil, the United States produces significantly more natural gas than Saudi Arabia. According to the Energy Information Administration, United States energy production is about evenly split between petroleum and natural gas. Saudi Arabia, on the other hand, primarily produces petroleum. The majority of the United States’ oil production growth is concentrated in four regions: Bakken, N.D., Eagle Ford, Texas, the Niobrara region in the Upper Midwest, and the Permian Basin of Texas and New Mexico. North Dakota and Texas together comprise almost 50 percent of all crude oil production in the United States -- compared to 2010, when the two states combined produced just 26 percent of all United States crude oil production. In 2013, energy markets consultant group PIRA Energy published a report that said shale production is one of the driving forces behind the country’s production growth. Shale oil and gas are commonly associated with hydraulic fracturing, or fracking, which is the process of using water pressure to fracture a rock to release natural gas and oil. The United States is the world leader in shale gas production. There is at least one piece of context to keep in mind when looking at the United States’ oil production compared to Saudi Arabia, noted Leonardo Maugeri, an associate at Harvard University’s Geopolitics of Energy project. Saudi Arabia has a higher capacity than the United States to produce oil, but it chooses not to use it all -- so as not to inundate the global oil market. "In other words, if Saudi Arabia produced at full capacity -- as the U.S. does -- its production would be higher than the U.S.," Maugeri said. Our ruling Klobuchar said the United States is "now the No. 1 producer of oil in the world." The latest global oil production statistics back up Klobuchar’s claim. The United States has been the world’s largest oil producer since late 2012. We rate her statement True.

pomt-11197	"I am roughly being paid $53 a day to educate your child."	false	/north-carolina/statements/2018/may/15/stokes-county-school-teacher/nc-teacher-i-make-53-day-records-show-hes-wrong/	For the hottest debate in North Carolina politics, look no further than teacher pay. Gov. Roy Cooper often talks about the need for higher teacher pay. Meanwhile, Republicans in the GOP-controlled legislature brag about raising teacher salaries each of the past five years. Now, with teachers scheduled to rally in Raleigh on May 16 to raise awareness about the need for more education funding, one teacher’s story has gained traction in the politisphere. Nick Cols, a teacher from Western North Carolina, posted on Facebook that his "take home pay" for April was $1,715 after insurance and child-care and taxes were deducted. "I am roughly being paid $53 a day to educate your child," he posted. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com PolitiFact usually sticks to fact-checking politicians, pundits, fake news sites and prominent organizational leaders. But this claim quickly gained traction not only in North Carolina news but across the country. His story was shared by Cooper and others to emphasize their position that state lawmakers aren’t properly funding education. With that in mind, PolitiFact found it necessary to review his claim. We reached out to the teacher for comment on specifics of his salary, but didn’t hear back. He also deleted the post. So we then reached out to the public school system in Stokes County, where he works. What records show Wage information for public school teachers — and all government employees — is public record. So Melisa Jessup, executive director of human resources for Stokes County Schools and the district’s lead spokeswoman, provided PolitiFact with the teacher’s information. The teacher — whose full name is Nicholas Brandes — works at North Stokes High School and has been a teacher for nine years and eight months, Jessup said. That means, under the state’s salary schedule for teachers with bachelor’s degrees, he qualifies for an annual salary of $40,550 from the state. (A first-year teacher with a bachelor’s degree would receive a $35,000 salary, which would jump above $40,000 after 10 years, $45,000 after 15 years, and $50,000 after 23 years.) North Carolina’s public school teachers also receive supplements from their county governments. In Stokes County, that means Brandes gets about 4 percent of his annual state salary added to his pay from the county. That would mean a teacher with his level of experience makes about $42,172 per year before taxes. On top of that, Brandes is currently an assistant coach for the football and wrestling teams. So he receives an additional $2,300 for each year that he coaches those teams. How his pay compares So that puts his annual salary at $44,472 before taxes, health insurance and childcare costs are taken out. That $44,472 salary is slightly higher than the most recent median income calculated for Stokes County — $42,489 — but lower than the most recent median income calculated for all North Carolina residents, $48,256. The average salary for North Carolina teachers across the board (including all levels of experience) is $51,214. See Figure 2 on PolitiFact.com Some teachers choose to only accept checks during the school year, which runs from mid August to early June. Brandes chose to have his salary spread out over 12 months, so his monthly income is about $3,706. And, according to Jessup, his deductions for "optional supplemental insurances and various other pre-tax deductions, as well as health insurance costs" come out to about $954 a month. That includes childcare. That leaves him with about $2,752 a month. Now let’s look at weekly and daily pay. Excluding holidays or days off, there are typically four five-day work weeks in a month. A monthly $2,752 paycheck spreads out to $688 a week and $137 a day. Checking the check Rather than speak hypothetically, let’s return to the $1,715 paycheck Brandes posted on Facebook. There appear to be problems with the teacher’s math. To arrive at the $53-per-day figure for April, Brandes would’ve had to divide $1,715 by 32 days. However, there were 30 days in April. More importantly, the school system told PolitiFact that Brades worked approximately 21.5 days in April. So his check for that month — $1,715 — divided by 21.5 equals $79.76 per day. That difference of $26.76 per day doesn’t sound like much. But extrapolated over 21.5 days, there’s a $575 difference between what readers might think Brandes earned in April versus what he actually made. Apply the same math ($575 times 12) over a year and there’s a difference of $6,906 between what Brandes could be taking home annually compared with what could be derived from Facebook and in the media. Our ruling A teacher in western North Carolina said he makes $53 a day, spurring politicians to use his claim to support their position that teachers across the state are underpaid. The difference between what the teacher claimed and what the records show is about $26.76. In other words, his daily pay in April was about 50 percent higher than he claimed it was. What teachers make is an important debate — one that should be won or lost on solid numbers. There are many ways of illustrating a correct number, but the $53/day is not the poster child it was made out to be. We rate this statement False.

pomt-03750	"The financial penalties imposed" on gay couples "can cost us more than $300,000 compared with married heterosexual couples over a lifetime."	mostly true	/florida/statements/2013/apr/08/nadine-smith/equality-florida-director-nadine-smith-says-gay-co/	First comes love, then comes marriage ... then comes the potential savings of a joint tax return. That’s the story for opposite-sex couples, but not necessarily for same-sex couples. Gay couples aren’t entitled to some of the money-saving benefits available to opposite-sex married couples. But how much lost money is it for a gay couple? Equality Florida, a group that advocates on behalf of the gay community, raised that topic as the U.S. Supreme Court heard two cases related to gay marriage in March: a challenge to California’s Proposition 8, which defines marriage as between a man and a woman, and a challenge to the federal Defense of Marriage Act, a 1996 law that defines marriage as between a man and a woman. (For more on the cases read PolitiFact’s primer.) The DOMA case stems from a financial issue involving Edith "Edie" Windsor, who lived with Thea Spyer for 44 years; they married in Canada in 2007. After Spyer’s death in 2009, Windsor had to pay $363,000 in taxes on her spouse’s estate rather than inheriting it outright, as mixed-gender married couples routinely do. Nadine Smith, executive director of Equality Florida, wrote in a press release on March 27 that she was hopeful the Supreme Court would move to end the federal ban on same-sex marriage: "If observers are correct, gay married couples including my wife and I will not be faced with tax forms that require us to lie and deny the existence of our spouse. The financial penalties imposed because we are considered legal strangers can cost us more than $300,000 compared with married heterosexual couples over a lifetime. In a stroke, this financial burden will be erased." We wanted to research how Smith concluded that gay couples can pay $300,000 more than heterosexual couples over a lifetime. Cost estimates for gay couples In response to our questions, Smith sent us media reports that mentioned various higher costs for gay couples ranging from taxes, to renting a car to divorce. The most in-depth analysis came from the New York Times, which spent two months in 2009 calculating the added costs of being a gay couple over a lifetime, including taxes, health insurance, pensions, having a child and other expenses. For the tax portion, the New York Times received assistance from Roberton Williams of the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center. The analysis created a fictitious couple in New York, gave them two kids and assumed one parent would stay home for five years to take care of them. The analysis took factors into account based on three states with large gay populations: Florida, New York and California. (The New York Times provided 25 pages of details on how they arrived at the calculations.) The newspaper calculated two separate scenarios, both starting when the couples were 35. In the first scenario, one partner earned $110,000 and the other $30,000; in the second, each earned $70,000. The conclusion: the worst-case scenario over a couple’s lifetime was $467,562. But that fell to $41,196 in the best-case scenario, for a couple with better health insurance and lower taxes. The numbers varied depending on income and other factors. "For wealthy couples with a lot of assets, on the other hand, the cost of being gay could easily spiral into the millions," the New York Times wrote. One of the reporters who wrote the story, Tara Siegel-Bernard, and two of the experts consulted for that story told PolitiFact Florida that the dollar figures in 2009 would change in 2013. But without thoroughly redoing the analysis, it was hard to assess by how much. One key factor that has changed since then is that in 2011, New York passed a law allowing same-sex marriage. The couple could now file a joint state income tax return, which may or may not save a gay couple money. There have also been some health insurance changes. Even if the Supreme Court strikes down DOMA, it won’t erase all the financial and legal hurdles for gay couples, the New York Times wrote. For example, many couples would still have to travel to another state to get married. "It is hard to present any sort of average -- people are in very different situations for all the reasons you noted," said Lee Badgett, an economics professor at the University of Massachusetts who has studied gay marriage. We sent Equality Florida’s claim to the the National Organization for Marriage, a group that opposes gay marriage. The group’s political director Frank Schubert also noted that the New York Times analysis was built on multiple assumptions. Schubert disagreed with some assumptions. "For example, in one of the scenarios the New York Times assumed that the same-sex couple would not receive any health coverage for one of the partners for the entire duration of their 50-year relationship. Many companies already provide health coverage for domestic partners, and this percentage is growing rapidly. Policy makers could address this issue without redefining marriage. Similarly, the analysis was conducted before New York redefined marriage, which makes the state tax calculations moot." We asked Smith in an email why she cited the $300,000 figure. "I guess I could have said more than $400,000 but I was being conservative. Edie Windsor was forced to pay $363,000 because her marriage was not recognized, so it is number that is familiar to the general public. In addition, Florida is the least hospitable of the three states used in the modeling: Florida, New York and California." Parenting among gay couples is more common in the South than other regions of the country, "so we are seeing the additional costs add up," wrote Smith, who along with her wife is raising a son. (They married in Vermont.) Our ruling Nadine Smith, the director of Equality Florida, said, "The financial penalties imposed" on gay couples "can cost us more than $300,000 compared with married heterosexual couples over a lifetime." Smith said "penalties" are "imposed" on same-sex couples. Actually, it's more accurate to say that they don't have access to the same benefits as opposite-sex couples. On the question of numbers, is it possible that for some gay couples, the cost would add up to $300,000 over a lifetime? The key here is that word "can." It is difficult to come up with an average because the taxes, health insurance and expenses vary from couple to couple depending on where they live and other factors. The most extensive analysis we saw from the New York Times calculated a range between about $41,196 and $467,562 in 2009. The $300,000 cited by Smith falls within that range but requires some explanation. We rate this claim Mostly True.	None	Nadine Smith	None	None	None	2013-04-08T12:05:23	2013-03-27	['None']
pomt-08104	"A 5 percent increase in domestic production would increase the world supply by less than 1 percent and do almost nothing to our dependence on foreign oil. This would also have virtually no effect on the price of gas at the pump."	true	/florida/statements/2010/dec/13/debbie-wasserman-schultz/wasserman-schultz-says-expanding-drilling-would-ha/	On Dec. 1, 2010, Secretary of Interior Ken Salazar announced that the Obama administration would not allow oil and gas drilling through 2017 in the Eastern Gulf of Mexico. That decision reversed one by the administration weeks before the April 20, 2010, Deepwater Horizon explosion. December's announcement prompted cheers from U.S. Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz, a Democrat who represents Congressional District 20 in South Florida. In a Dec. 1 press release, Wasserman Schultz wrote: "A 5 percent increase in domestic production would increase the world supply by less than 1 percent and do almost nothing to our dependence on foreign oil. This would also have virtually no effect on the price of gas at the pump, which is something every consumer really cares about. Adding a fraction of a percent to the global oil supply will not lower gas prices and ignores the critical need to develop alternative energy supplies that finally break our addiction to fossil fuels." The Truth-O-Meter has examined several claims about oil drilling and gas prices. But we wanted to know for this Truth-O-Meter, is Wasserman Schultz right? Would a 5 percent increase in domestic production increase the world supply by less than 1 percent, and why did she choose that 5 percent number anyway? Was she correct that such production would do almost nothing to our dependence on foreign oil and have virtually no effect on price at the pump? We pulled background about oil drilling and gas prices from a June 2008 Truth-O-Meter ruling on U.S. Sen. and then-presidential candidate John McCain, who used the high price of gas as part of his argument to expand drilling. PolitiFact ruled False on his claim: "We must deal with the here and now and assure affordable fuel for America by increasing domestic production." Background on drilling and gas prices PolitiFact wrote: The political momentum for offshore drilling has always risen and fallen along with gas prices. But while there are strong arguments that can be made in favor of offshore drilling, reducing the cost of gas "here and now" isn't one of them, according to oil experts and economists -- many of whom support the plan. For starters, the lead time for oil exploration takes years. Even if offshore drilling areas opened up tomorrow, experts say it would take at least 10 years to realize any significant production. And even then, they say, the U.S. contribution to the overall global oil market would not be enough to make a significant dent in the price of gas. "Drilling offshore to lower oil prices is like walking an extra 20 feet per day to lose weight," said David Sandalow, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, and author of Freedom from Oil. "It's just not going to make much difference." It takes years to bring new oil wells online, said Mike Rodgers, a leading oil expert with PFC Energy in Washington. Companies need to drill exploratory wells, then discovery wells around the exploratory wells that show promise. Shipyards that build platforms, a two- to three-year job, are already booked solid. "It's foolish to sell it as a short-term solution to high gas prices," Rodgers said. "Opening off-shore drilling would have no impact whatsoever on gas prices today." Warning! Math starts here Now back to Wasserman Schultz's claim. We asked her spokesman Jonathan Beeton for background information and he sent an e-mail with links to the documents Wasserman Schultz used. We're warning you now: This documentation includes lots of math. For starters, Beeton pointed us to a map from the U.S. Department of Interior attached to a March 31, 2010, press release which shows that drilling in the Eastern Gulf could increase production by .274 millions of barrels a day. The chart also states that in 2007, U.S. domestic production was about 5.07 million barrels of oil a day. That translates to about 5.4 percent increase -- that's why Wasserman Schultz uses a 5 percent increase. Beeton then turned to the Energy Information Administration, which provides statistics and analysis to the U.S. Department of Energy and Congress. The EIA showed that the U.S. consumes 19.5 million barrels per day as of 2008. EIA also states that global consumption of oil is about 85.46 million barrels a day (look for the world total on the bottom of the same chart for 2008.) Then Beeton did some math: Divide the amount that drilling in the Eastern Gulf could increase daily production -- .274 millions of barrels -- by global consumption of oil -- 85.46 million barrels a day -- and you get .32 percent increase to the world supply. That is less than 1 percent. With current U.S. production of 5.07 millions of barrels a day, and U.S. consumption of 19.5 millions of barrels a day, then we produce 26 percent of what we consume, Beeton wrote. Increasing production to 5.344 (5.07 + 0.274) millions of barrels a day, would increase that number to 27.4 percent -- or a decrease reliance on foreign oil by 1.4 percentage points. The experts weigh in We ran Wasserman Schultz's claim by Jamie Webster, a senior consultant with PFC Energy, which tracks oil production and demand globally and whose clients are governments, including the United States., and oil and gas companies. We also heard from Daniel J. Weiss, who has written extensively about oil prices and policy and is a senior fellow and director of climate strategy at the Center for American Progress, which describes itself as a progressive think tank. Both Webster and Weiss agreed with Wasserman Schultz. A 5 percent increase would produce around 200,000 to 300,000 barrels of oil a day while the world produced about 85 million barrels a day this year, Webster said. "An increase like that would be one-third of a percent," Webster said. "It could feasibly back up some potential imports but it would be almost a rounding error." As for prices at the pump, "it wouldn't budge the market at all. We would still need to import gasoline; it would not have any impact. You wouldn't notice it at all." Weiss pointed to a chart from the Energy Information Administration, which shows projections of gas and oil costs in 2020 and 2030. "Her point that it's going to make no difference in supply, no real difference in price, is correct," Weiss said. Let's review: Wasserman Schultz's math adds up -- Gulf drilling does indeed represent about 5 percent of current domestic production, and a 5 percent increase would barely register in terms of the world supply. And the experts we found for this Truth-O-Meter as well as ones cited in the past about McCain's claim agree that expanding drilling now would have little effect at the pump any time soon. We rate this claim True.	None	Debbie Wasserman Schultz	None	None	None	2010-12-13T11:35:12	2010-12-01	['None']
pomt-02429	"We are seeing dramatic rate cuts" to Medicare that will affect seniors’ ability to keep their doctor, hospital and prevention services.	mostly false	/florida/statements/2014/mar/03/rick-scott/rick-scott-says-medicare-rate-cuts-will-affect-sen/	Seniors (particularly voters), listen up: Medicare cuts have arrived -- and the way Gov. Rick Scott tells it, they’re going to lead to some sickening results. In an online ad created by Scott’s campaign, he speaks in a testimonial style to the "wonderful seniors in our state" who depend on Medicare. Scott, and his likely Democratic opponent former Gov. Charlie Crist, will compete for the senior vote in the November election. Here’s part of the script: "We already know that 300,000 people in our state were told they are going to lose their insurance, but now under Medicare we are seeing these dramatic rate cuts. It’s going to have a devastating impact on their ability to one, get the doctor, look they rely on their doctor, get to go to the hospital that they trust, make sure they get prevention services that they deserve. These Medicare cuts that the president has caused are the wrong thing for Florida seniors." PolitiFact has previously fact-checked claims about those 300,000 Floridians who are losing Florida Blue plans but are being transitioned to other ones. Here, we wanted to fact-check Scott’s claim about whether dramatic rate cuts to Medicare will result in a "devastating impact" on seniors' ability to keep their doctor, hospital and get prevention services. In response to Scott’s ad, the Florida Democratic Party issued a press release that accused Scott of overseeing "the largest Medicare fraud in the nation's history." We rated that claim Mostly True. Announcement of cuts Scott’s ad posted a few days after the Obama administration announced a proposed rate cut to Medicare Advantage -- but Scott didn’t specify in his ad that he was referring to only those seniors on that particular type of Medicare. Nationwide, nearly one-third of Medicare recipients are on Medicare Advantage, or about 16 million. The proportion is about the same in Florida, where about 1.4 million are on Medicare Advantage, and roughly 4.4 million are in traditional Medicare. On Feb. 21, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services announced a proposed cut to Medicare Advantage Plans for 2015. While CMS describes it as a 1.9 percent cut, some insurers say the actual cut could be higher when taking into account other health care law changes. America’s Health Insurance Plans, an industry group, says the cut is about 5.9 percent and will lead to a loss of benefits and choices for people on Medicare Advantage. The amount is expected to be finalized April 7, and industry groups and a bipartisan group of senators have started to lobby against it. The health care law tries to bring down future health care costs of Medicare largely by reducing Medicare Advantage, a subset of Medicare plans that are run by private insurers. President George W. Bush started Medicare Advantage in hopes the increased competition would reduce costs. But those plans are actually costlier than traditional Medicare. So the health care law reduces payments to private insurers. Advantage plans are required to offer basic health benefits that are at least as rich as original Medicare. But many offer extras, such as rebates on premiums, routine dental care, gym memberships and rides to the doctor, in order to compete for business. Scott campaign spokesman Greg Blair pointed to articles in the Washington Post and Kaiser/USA Today about insurers cutting doctors from Medicare Advantage. (Both articles were written several weeks before the actual rate cut was proposed.) Reuters stated that insurers said they would only maintain benefits if there was no cut. "Thousands of primary-care doctors and specialists across the country have been terminated from privately run Medicare Advantage plans, ...." the Post wrote. "Insurers say they must shrink their physician networks because they face billions of dollars in government-payment cuts over the next decade — reductions that are being used partly to fund insurance coverage for millions of people under the federal Affordable Care Act." The Post wrote that medical associations describe the dismissals as the largest in the program’s history and that the American Medicare Association called for the cuts to be reversed. The Kaiser/USA Today December article states that the cut of thousands of doctors includes Florida, where "UnitedHealthcare has dropped the state’s only National Cancer Institute-designated cancer treatment facility, the Moffitt Cancer Center and its 250 physicians in Tampa." Experts say we don’t yet know full impact We interviewed several health care experts to ask if the Medicare Advantage cuts will result in seniors losing access to their doctors, hospitals or preventative services. Many experts said it could be several months until we get a better picture of what the rate cut means for patients -- and that the answer could vary state by state, or county by county. Lowell Richard works for a contracting agency, Adcahb Medical Coverages, that sells Medicare plans, including Medicare Advantage in Florida. "There will be some fallout -- absolutely," said Richard, vice president of training and education. However, "it’s going to vary from county to county. It’s really way too early to tell." Any company that decides to pull out of Advantage or make changes would have to file plans with CMS this summer, he said. Will the results be "devastating" in Florida as Scott said? "That depends where you live," said Richard, who is based in Broward County. In a smaller county with only a few types of plans, the result might mean the senior has to switch to another type of Medicare plan and the costs could go up. Some doctors will no longer be on certain Advantage plans. Though they will be replaced by others, it could mean some seniors will lose their particular doctor, Richard said. "There is no way to know how plans will respond to the proposed reductions in payments for 2015," said Tricia Neuman, director of the Kaiser Foundation’s Program on Medicare Policy. "The plans could choose to stay the course or reduce their costs in ways that would affect beneficiaries. The response could vary among insurers, and by county. The plans could choose to raise premiums, raise cost-sharing, tighten their provider networks, or even withdraw from the Medicare program altogether, but we won’t know the lay of the land until next fall." Margaret Murphy, attorney and associate director Center for Medicare Advocacy, said that Medicare Advantage plans have always had a limited network of preferred providers and that changes in networks can happen every year. (Traditional Medicare has no networks, so participants can go to any Medicare eligible provider.) "We are seeing (Medicare Advantage) plans change their business plans already although it’s difficult to know which changes are due to ordinary business reasons and which are the result" of the health care law, she said. Robert Moffit, a health care expert at the conservative Heritage Foundation, said that we have already seen an impact because insurers including UnitedHealthcare have let go of thousands of physicians. That includes cutting an entire hospital -- Yale New Haven Hospital -- from its Medicare Advantage network. "I can’t speak personally with regard to Florida, but yes, the projections are you will see significant reductions in payments over 10 years," Moffit said. Medicare has a broader provider network than many Advantage plans, "so even if plans cut benefits and caused someone to go back to traditional Medicare their access to doctors likely would not erode and might actually improve," said Jonathan Oberlander, a health policy professor at the University of North Carolina. Medicare requires plans to cover all Medicare-covered benefits, which means if a prevention benefit such as a mammogram is covered by traditional Medicare, it would also be covered by an Advantage plan, Neuman said. However, Advantage plans could cut the extras which aren’t covered by traditional Medicare such as a gym membership. Our ruling "We are seeing dramatic rate cuts," to Medicare that will have a "devastating impact" on seniors’ ability to get their doctor, their hospital and prevention services, Scott tells seniors in an online campaign ad. Scott omits that the recently announced rate cuts were for Medicare Advantage plans, a subset of Medicare. Those plans represent about one-third of Medicare plans in Florida and nationwide. The proposed rate cut won’t be finalized until April, and if it is, health care experts say we won’t know the full impact for a few months. That means it’s too soon to predict if the rate cut will have a "devastating impact" on seniors' ability to keep their same doctor and hospital. It is possible that some seniors on Medicare Advantage will lose or have to change doctors, but the impact could vary from county to county. Seniors on traditional Medicare are not affected by the cuts. Scott’s ad is a scare tactic that omits several caveats. We rate this claim Mostly False.

pomt-07121	The Medford Water Commission was fined $279,000 for dumping plain drinking water into a stream.	half-true	/oregon/statements/2011/jun/18/doug-whitsett/out-control-oregon-deq-levying-fines-no-reason/	Recently, state Sen. Doug Whitsett, R-Klamath Falls, excoriated the Department of Environmental Quality at a legislative budget hearing. He called the agency "out of control" and cited the following as one small example of DEQ’s lack of common sense: "In Medford, the Medford Water Commission has been fined $279,000 for the egregious offense of dumping drinking water in Lone Pine Creek. This is a practice that the, Lone Pine Creek is a highly urbanized stream, the Medford Water Commission has been doing this for decades. When it was determined by DEQ that this was some kind of offense, the Medford Water Commission agreed to stop doing it. They were fined almost $300,000 anyway." Whitsett’s implication is that DEQ trumped up a charge against the Medford Water Commission, which was just doing what it has done for years and causing no problem to anyone. And even after the commission agreed to stop doing what it thought was legal, DEQ remained unreasonable. We wanted to know if that was indeed the case. The facts: On Nov. 30, DEQ issued a $278,794 civil penalty against the Medford Water Commission for dumping chlorinated drinking water into Lone Pine Creek. (The commission sends extra water into the creek in the rainy season, when people don’t need as much water.) The water is OK for human consumption, but toxic to fish unable to tolerate the chlorine used to make the water drinkable in the first place. So the agency issued a fat fine, much of it based on the $13,000 annual cost the commission avoided for roughly a dozen years by not dechlorinating the water. The commission in its appeal basically claimed that it did nothing wrong, and in the alternate, that it didn’t know it was doing anything wrong. The appeal is pending. "It was plain drinking water," said Larry Rains, manager of the Medford Water Commission. "We're just arguing we thought we were following the rules, (and there is) a disagreement on how those rules are interpreted." On the face of it, it looks like a clear violation by the water commission: You can’t divert chlorinated drinking water into fish habitat. But then we put in a call to Sen. Whitsett, who said that the water commission never considered the creek a stream; it was a storm drain. "The rules have been that if you discharge chlorinated drinking water into a stream, it has to be dechlorinated. If it’s a storm drain, there has to be sufficient time for" the chlorine to dissipate before it reaches fish habitat, Whitsett said. "DEQ decided to call it a creek, and not a storm drain." So we checked with the department. Jeff Bachman with the agency’s Office of Compliance and Enforcement said there’s no way that Lone Pine Creek is a storm sewer. It’s an "urbanized stream," he said. A "storm sewer" or "storm drain" is a human-made system of channels, conduits, pipes or a mix of the above to control and carry storm water to a waterway. Bachman said Lone Pine Creek runs underground in a pipe, in a concrete channel through the Rogue Valley International-Medford Airport and in a natural stream channel. But, he added, even with storm drains you can’t just dump in chlorinated water: "The Department's policy on disposal of chlorinated water states that such water may be discharged to a storm sewer only if there is no other feasible alternative, such as dechlorination, and if the sewer is long enough such that the chlorine can dissipate during the time it takes the chlorinated water to travel to a water of the state." Again, we’re left to think that DEQ had every right to fine the water commission, although we can see where the confusion may lie. So we called Sen. Alan Bates, D-Ashland, who may be considered more friendly to environmental regulation than Whitsett. But Bates was just as ticked off at the agency as his Republican colleague over Lone Pine Creek. "It’s never been clear in anyone’s mind what it is," Bates said. "If you think of it as a pristine little creek, that’s sorely not the case. On the other hand, we’re trying to clean up these kinds of areas." Bates said it was fine for DEQ to point out the problem so the commission could fix it. But assessing a fine that dates back to 1997? He didn’t get that at all. "DEQ over-reached. They’ve lost their mind and put this huge fine on people." Whitsett’s statement is partially true, but lacking an important detail. He’s absolutely right about the amount of the fine, but he left out the fact that the water was chlorinated and unfit for fish habitat. We understand why he would, since he disputes Lone Pine Creek is a stream. On the other hand, as DEQ points out, people can’t just dump chlorinated drinking water into storm drains either. We rate the statement as Half True. As for whether the agency is justified in assessing such a large fine, well, we leave that question to you. Return to OregonLive to comment on this ruling.

pomt-07823	"Our debt to GDP ratios, our deficit to GDP ratios are quickly approaching the countries we have been reading about for the last year and a half. We are not far behind Ireland, Greece, Portugal and Spain and all these countries we have been reading about."	half-true	/ohio/statements/2011/feb/16/jim-jordan/rep-jim-jordan-compares-us-debt-troubled-european-/	As the newly-elected chairman of the conservative Republican Study Committee, Rep. Jim Jordan of Urbana has become one of the most vocal budget cutters in the U.S. House of Representatives. Just before he introduced "Spending Reduction Act" legislation to cut the federal budget by $2.5 trillion over ten years, Jordan delivered a speech to the conservative Heritage Foundation that focused on fiscal discipline. "Our debt to GDP ratios, our deficit to GDP ratios are quickly approaching the countries we have been reading about for the last year and a half," he warned. "We are not far behind Ireland, Greece, Portugal and Spain and all these countries we have been reading about." Everyone knows the United States government is in debt, but is the situation really as bleak as it is for countries that teeter on the brink of insolvency? Politifact Ohio decided to take a look. The Central Intelligence Agency has compiled a table that compares the ratio of public debt to the gross national product of more than 130 countries, including all those cited by Jordan. According to the CIA, in 2010, Zimbabwe had the world’s highest public debt as a percentage of its annual gross domestic product: a whopping 241.6 percent. Japan was next at 196.4 percent. Greece was fourth on the list, at 144 percent, Ireland was 11th, at 98.5 percent, Portugal was 15th, at 83.2 percent, and Spain was 27th at 63.4 percent. The United States clocked in at 37th, with a debt to GDP ratio of 58.9 percent, slightly higher than the world average of 58.3 percent. Countries including Canada, France and Germany – which aren’t generally listed among the globe’s festering fiscal fiascos – all have debt to GDP ratios that exceed the United States’. Federal bean counters at the White House’s Office of Management and Budget and at the Congressional Budget Office predict the nation’s public debt to GDP ratio will climb to about 77 percent in the next 10 years, which exceed’s Spain’s current ratio and approaches Portugal’s. "With such a large increase in debt, plus an expected increase in interest rates as the economic recovery strengthens, interest payments on the debt are poised to skyrocket over the next decade," the CBO said in a recent report on the federal deficit. Is that level of debt likely to cause problems along the lines of those experienced by Greece, Ireland and other countries deemed fiscally unsound? Economists are divided on that question, although a study released last year suggests problems are most likely to arise after public debt reaches around 90 percent of gross domestic product. University of Texas economist James K. Galbraith notes that many countries with higher debt to GDP ratios than the United States, like Japan, Italy and Belgium, aren’t in a financial crisis. He says Jordan’s numbers are correct, but the comparisons he makes are "meaningless and therefore misleading." He says Japan and the United States are insulated from the default issues that plague other countries because they control the currencies in which they issue debt. Greece, Spain, Ireland and Portugal all have their debt in euros, so they need euro balances on hand to pay their debts. "Greece has to draw on a euro account at a bank in order to make payments," Galbraith explained in an email. "If the euros are not in the account, Greek government checks could bounce. In this respect, Greece is much more like, say, the state of Illinois; the European Central Bank is not obliged to honor its checks." On the other hand, he said the United States government makes all payments by marking up numbers in a computer -- the electronic equivalent of printing money. It doesn't get the dollars from anywhere -- it just sends a signal to the bank. He says U.S. Treasury Department checks can’t bounce, so there’s no default danger. "As should be obvious, the markets know this, and so made the U.S. into a major beneficiary of the crisis of Greece et al.," Galbraith said. "As Mediterranean eurozone bond yields rose, U.S. treasury yields fell. Why? Because investors sold Greece (and the others) and bought U.S. The markets thus recognize what Mr. Jordan does not: the U.S. public debt position is large and invulnerable, and actually opposite to that of the small, vulnerable eurozone nations." Boston University’s Laurence J. Kotlikoff is among those who predict dire consequences if the nation doesn’t get its fiscal house in order. He envisions massive benefit cuts for retired baby boomers, "astronomical tax increases that leave the young with little incentive to work and save," and the government "simply printing vast quantities of money to cover its bills." Poverty and inflation are other problems he foresees. "You print a lot of money, prices go up and people get hurt because money they had before you did this goes down in value in terms of what it can buy," Kotlikoff said in a TV interview. So what to make of Jordan’s statement? While the United States hasn’t yet reached the debt-to-GDP levels of the countries he cited, it’s on on its way there. But it’s not clear that attaining those debt levels would cause the catastrophic economic damage he implies. Other countries with high debt-to-GDP ratios haven’t imploded, but specifically citing nations like Ireland and Greece implies that disaster is near for the United States economy. In reality, the United States, with its ability to control its own monetary supply, has lots more going for it than Ireland or Greece. Those are important details needed to put Jordan’s statement in proper context. On the Truth-O-Meter, we rate Jordan’s claim as Half True.

pomt-11969	"San Juan Teamsters didn't show up for work to distribute relief supplies" because they went on strike.	pants on fire!	/punditfact/statements/2017/oct/03/blog-posting/fake-news-posts-blame-puerto-ricos-truck-drivers-r/	Conservative news outlets have been spreading a false story online that wrongly says aid to Hurricane Maria victims isn’t being distributed in Puerto Rico because union truck drivers have gone on strike. The headline on a Sept. 30, 2017, post on The Gateway Pundit read, "San Juan Teamsters didn’t show up for work to distribute relief supplies — U.S. aid rotting at ports." Facebook users flagged the story as being potentially fabricated, as part of the social network’s efforts to curb fake news. Similar headlines appeared on several other links that users questioned. The post claimed that while the "liberal media" is attacking President Donald Trump’s response to the humanitarian crisis, the real issue is that "the Teamsters Union drivers did not show up to work. Only 20 percent of drivers arrived at the ports to distribute the relief supplies," The Gateway Pundit said. The other posts all shared the same sentiment, and often included "proof" from more social media posts claiming to know all about the problem. But they aren’t right to blame union truckers for the lack of movement. It turns out the blog posts are delivering misinformation about this problem. Sites are picking and choosing details The Gateway Pundit pointed to another Sept. 30 post from TheConservativeTreehouse.com, which cited a Sept. 29 Huffington Post interview with U.S. Air Force Col. Michael A. Valle. Valle was born in Puerto Rico and was leading Maria relief efforts. The Conservative Treehouse post included a passage from the interview that said supplies are being sent to Puerto Rico, but not being moved across the island. "It’s a lack of drivers for the transport trucks, the 18 wheelers," the website quoted Valle as saying. "Supplies we have. Trucks we have. There are ships full of supplies, backed up in the ports, waiting to have a vehicle to unload into. However, only 20 percent of the truck drivers show up to work. These are private citizens in Puerto Rico, paid by companies that are contracted by the government." Valle did say in the Huffington Post interview that there was a lack of drivers, but he also went on to add the drivers deserved "zero blame:" "They can’t get to work, the infrastructure is destroyed, they can’t get fuel themselves, and they can’t call us for help because there’s no communication. The will of the people of Puerto Rico is off the charts. The truck drivers have families to take care of, many of them have no food or water. They have to take care of their family’s needs before they go off to work, and once they do go, they can’t call home." The Conservative Treehouse also posted a video of CNBC’s Contessa Brewer reporting from San Juan as proof of the problem, but ignored the part where Brewer said transportation problems are not the drivers’ fault. "You’re looking at truck drivers who can’t be reached by their businesses by cell phone, they don’t have the gas to get to work, and then even when they do get to work, their semi-trucks don’t have fuel," Brewer said. "The problem is the supply chain." She added that Crowley Puerto Rico, a shipping and logistics company, said that getting drivers to the port and back out again was proving to be a challenge. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com There has been a definite problem moving supplies that have arrived. On Sept. 29, the same day Valle’s interview was published, the Teamsters sent out a press release asking union truck drivers to volunteer to go to Puerto Rico to help transport supplies. The release warned that it wouldn’t be easy, but fellow union workers needed help. "At this time, it is unclear if there are trucks available to move the containers, fuel to operate the trucks or road access to the distribution centers," the release read. "However, the labor movement is working on the ground in Puerto Rico to bring volunteers to meet specific needs." There’s no mention of strike in the press release, and nothing in Valle’s interview about labor unions, so where did the The Conservative Treehouse get that? From an interview with a trucker not affiliated with the Teamsters union. The blog turned to a Spanish-language interview for Lo Sé Todo on Wapa.tv with Victor Rodriguez, identifying as "the boss of a very sketchy (corrupt and violent) Puerto Rico trucker’s union called Fente Amplio." Dozens of subsequent posts online identify Frente Amplio (note the different spelling) as the local Teamsters union, which Teamsters spokesman Galen Munroe told us is incorrect. Rodriguez represents the independent Frente Amplio de Camioneros de Puerto Rico (Broad Front of Truck Drivers of Puerto Rico), which is not affiliated with the Teamsters. TheConservativeTreehouse.com egregiously misrepresented Rodriguez’s interview, translating it to claim that Rodriguez said truck drivers are refusing to work as part of a plan to show up Puerto Rico’s governor. "Since the country doesn’t care about truckers, the truckers won’t help," TheConservativeTreehouse.com quoted Rodriguez. It credits the reporter with getting Rodriguez to admit his defiance. See Figure 2 on PolitiFact.com In truth, Rodriguez is saying the opposite, that despite a disagreement over a law signed by Puerto Rican Gov. Ricardo Rosselló concerning truck permitting, drivers should help in any way they can. Truckers called off a planned strike because of Hurricane Irma three weeks prior, he said. Rodriguez did take a swipe at Rosselló, saying long lines are partly his fault, and noted that truckers can’t come down when they are in regions with impassable roads. But by and large, Rodriguez said that truckers are working and doing what they need to do to deliver goods. He even cuts off the reporter at one point for suggesting they are refusing to work. In response to all the false stories online blaming Teamster drivers, the union released a statement on Oct. 2 that said their members have been working since Maria passed over the island. The statement blamed "online, anti-union sources" for spreading an inaccurate story. "These viral stories spreading across the internet are nothing but lies perpetrated by anti-union entities to further their destructive agenda," Teamsters president Jim Hoffa said in the release. "The fact that they are attempting to capitalize on the suffering of millions of citizens in Puerto Rico that are (in) dire need of our help by pushing these false stories, just exposes their true nature." Our ruling Bloggers said that "San Juan Teamsters didn't show up for work to distribute relief supplies" because they went on strike after Hurricane Maria. The widespread accusations trace back to a post that selectively edited and mistranslated interviews to make it look like union truckers were being greedy and lazy. But there’s no strike, and union truck drivers have been trying to move aid shipments across Puerto Rico. There are multiple logistical problems slowing down transport, not the least of which is that some drivers simply can’t get to the port, or drive on impassable roads. Bloggers are misrepresenting a real humanitarian crisis by blaming trade unions. That drives this rating to Pants On Fire!

pomt-01238	Georgia has some of the highest gas taxes in the Southeast but one of the lowest taxes on gasoline for transportation in the nation.	mostly true	/georgia/statements/2014/nov/18/ed-lindsey/gas-tax-comparison-mostly-target/	Transportation trumped all other issues in a recent survey of the 10-county Atlanta region. Some lawmakers float the idea of hiking the state’s gasoline tax almost annually, but now leaders under the Gold Dome have signaled they may consider the move to tackle some of the traffic woes in the region and state. But the political will to increase one tax may hinge on the ability to lower, or eliminate, another. Specifically, former state Rep. Edward Lindsey, R-Atlanta, said the state may need to revoke local governments’ ability to levy sales taxes for nontransportation services such as education. "The following two statements are both true: We have one of the lowest taxes on gasoline for transportation purposes in the country," he said. "And we have some of the highest taxes on gasoline in the Southeast." How can that be? We decided to check it out. First breaking the claim into two pieces, does Georgia have one of the nation’s lowest gas taxes? Yes, according to state motor fuel tax data from the Federation of Tax Administrators. Georgians pay $19.3 cents in state taxes for every gallon of gasoline. That includes a 7.5-cent excise tax – or a special fixed tax paid on the purchase of specific items such as gasoline, alcohol and tobacco products. The rest comes from a 4 percent sales tax the state levies on gasoline. As of January, that 4 percent sales tax translated into 11.8 cents. Only 14 states had lower state tax rates, including both excise and state sales taxes. Three of them are our neighbors: South Carolina (16.75 cents per gallon), Florida (17.1 cents) and Alabama (18 cents). Motorists in our other two neighboring states paid more, 37.75 cents in North Carolina and 21.4 cents in Tennessee. So far, so good. Georgia does in fact have some of the lowest taxes earmarked for transportation in the nation. But to Lindsey’s point, the state collections do not include the local sales taxes that drive up the cost at the pump but do not always end up fixing roads. That’s because Georgia state law allows all counties to levy a 1 percent special purpose local option sales tax, or SPLOST, for specific projects ranging from transportation to education. Voters must approve a SPLOST by referendum. Although some jurisdictions, such as Forsyth County, have successfully included road projects in their referendums, voters in metro Atlanta and some other regions in the state defeated a penny sales tax for transportation two years ago. That is part of what has left roads, bridges and rails without enough money for repairs and growth – and why a study committee of politicians and business leaders is slated to recommend a new proposal by year’s end. Lindsey, who serves on that committee, unofficially known as the Plan B Committee, said he hopes drawing attention to the local sales taxes will show the state should wean local governments off those funds while simultaneously increasing the state collections, specifically for transportation projects. "When we put a tax or a fee on gasoline, the average voter probably thinks those taxes are going to transportation and they’re not," Lindsey said. But are Georgians really paying some of the highest gas taxes in the region – and could therefore afford such a shift? That’s where the numbers get tricky. An October breakdown of motor fuel taxes by the American Petroleum Institute -- including fees and local taxes -- pushes what Georgians pay to 27.49 cents per gallon. Those local taxes and fees have a dramatic effect in Florida, as anyone who has trundled down to Disney World can attest. The API shows motorists there pay a state average of 36.02 cents per gallon. North Carolina motorists pay even more, 36.75 cents per gallon, according to the API data (although less than what the Federation of Tax Administrators’ data show). Wes Clarke, a senior associate at the Carl Vinson Institute of Government at the University of Georgia, co-wrote a 2010 study that showed Georgia had one of the lowest gas taxes in the nation, The API data, he said, show that Georgia still ranks third-highest of its neighbors (and all other Southern states, except Kentucky) when it comes to gas taxes. The ranking is misleading, though. Based on the API data, Georgia could increase its gas tax by 8 cents a gallon – more than doubling the current excise tax – and remain in third. In fact, the Fiscal Research Center in 2010 recommended a somewhat smaller increase to the excise tax – a penny a year for six years – to help solve Georgia’s transportation woes. That would bring Georgia up to the national average on excise taxes, without changing its ranking among neighboring states, said Peter Bluestone, a senior research associate at the Fiscal Research Center. That would result in less than a 0.3 percent increase at the gas station. "Even if you add in the local taxes, we’re in the middle," Bluestone said. "We do recommend an increase that would keep us there." So that means Lindsey is right in saying that Georgia has one of the lowest state tax rates in the nation. Other data show that, factoring in local taxes, Georgians still pay the third-most in the region when it comes to filling up at the pump. Lindsey errs in thinking a third-place ranking means the state is on par with the top two, which are among the highest in the nation. He undercuts his larger point about local gas taxes by ignoring Georgia falling a distant third in the region on what motorists pay for gasoline. But looking at rankings alone, Georgians do pay among the highest at the pump for the region but the lowest in the nation. We rate his statement Mostly True.

pomt-05017	The health care law "adds around $800 billion of taxes on the American people. It does not discriminate between rich and poor."	false	/florida/statements/2012/jul/16/marco-rubio/rubio-says-taxes-health-care-law-do-not-discrimina/	It’s not news that Republicans predict the health care overhaul will spell devastation for business. But Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., is taking it further. He warns the law will "hurt everyone." "Obamacare is bad policy that adds around $800 billion of taxes on the American people," he wrote in a July 8 opinion-editorial in the Orlando Sentinel. "It does not discriminate between rich and poor. It hurts everyone." We wondered where he got his $800 billion tax total, as well as the validity of the idea that the law does not "discriminate between rich and poor." So we decided to check it out. $800 billion in new taxes? Rubio pulled the figure from a 2011 report by the nonpartisan Congressional Research Office and Joint Committee on Taxation. It was commissioned by Republican House Speaker John Boehner to estimate the cost of repealing the health care law. Repealing the law would result in $813 billion in lost revenues for the government between 2012 and 2021, the report found. Where do those come from? To pay for the overhaul, the federal government created a series of new revenue sources -- some are clearly taxes, some are changes to tax rules -- that include the controversial tax penalty for people who do not have their own health insurance and a tax on indoor tanning. (We looked at more than a dozen revenue sources and whether they were actually taxes in a January PolitiFact report.) Whether each revenue source is technically a tax does not matter to Rubio. Here, he equates all money raised from Americans as a tax. Also, Rubio’s number doesn’t account for the tax breaks that are in the law, especially the tax credits that some people of modest means will receive to help them buy insurance. We consulted several experts, who disagreed on the best way to account for the law’s tax increases. A couple experts said Rubio’s $800 billion figure is valid, even if it is out of date and does not account for billions in tax credits. "It's just stating what the tax bill is," said Joseph Henchman, of the business-backed Tax Policy Foundation. "Most people don't expect you to net out benefits." Not so fast, said Chapin White, a former CBO staffer who is now a senior health researcher at the Center for Studying Health System Change, a health research group founded by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation. White said it’s important to subtract the law’s $519 billion in refundable tax credits and subsidies for health insurance, among other things. All told, the more appropriate net "tax increase" over 10 years is about $20 billion, he said. No difference between rich and poor? Rubio spokesman Alex Conant declined to elaborate on what Rubio meant when he said the law does not "discriminate between rich and poor," saying he did not want to parse his words. The best we can infer from Rubio’s claim and the context around it is the health care law affects the rich and the poor the same, tax-wise. And that’s off base. The point of the law was to expand health coverage to those who don’t have it -- including people who don't have jobs or have low income. To make that happen, the law provides tax credits to low- and moderate-income families, and it includes more taxes on the wealthy and an individual mandate requiring most Americans to obtain health insurance. Two of the biggest taxes in the law are geared toward taxpayers with higher incomes. People whose incomes exceed $200,000 ($250,000 for couples filing jointly) will pay 0.9 percentage point more on Medicare payroll taxes in 2013. These people would also pay a new 3.8 percent tax on investment income. Plus, the law includes a 40 percent excise tax on people who have high-premium health insurance plans starting in 2018. Also known as "Cadillac plans," these premiums are usually obtained by people in the middle- to upper- class, and are expected to bring in $111 billion through 2021. Democrats, of course, take a different view than the Republicans. The Democrat-controlled U.S. Senate Finance Committee released a compilation of tax breaks available to individuals, middle-class families, and small businesses, thanks to the law. The total? $828 billion in "tax cuts" over 10 years. Most of that comes from tax credits and subsidies for families with low- to moderate-level incomes. The law creates exchanges through which consumers can shop for the best plans. People who qualify can supplement the cost of an insurance plan with a government subsidy, which will be based on income. A break is also extended to certain small businesses with low-income workers who employ fewer than 50 people and offer health insurance to them. Now for the individual mandate, which requires most everyone to have health insurance in 2014 or pay a penalty to the Internal Revenue Service. You could argue it doesn’t discriminate between rich and poor because it applies to most everyone. But the penalty is linked to income. Individuals who go uninsured and who aren't exempt from the mandate will have to pay an annual penalty of at least $95 per adult in 2014, rising to $325 in 2015 and $695 in 2016. After 2016, the amount would be indexed to inflation and could be higher -- 2.5 percent of household income, if that’s greater than the amount written into the law. The nonpartisan federal researchers at CBO and JCT have estimated that about 4 million uninsured Americans, including dependents, will have to pay up in 2016, amounting to $4 billion in revenue per year from 2017 to 2019. Probably most relevant to our fact-check is the fact that the mandate includes a hardship exemption for people who cannot afford to buy health insurance. Our ruling Rubio cherry-picks the highest number he can find -- $800 billion in new taxes -- to garner opposition to the recently upheld health care law. He doesn’t tell readers anything more about the figure, including the fact that these "taxes" would be garnered over 10 years. His statement also indicates that rich and poor people will feel the effects of the law’s various revenue-raising provisions with the same degree of pain. But that’s not true. The law taxes wealthier Americans to a greater degree to provide more services for the poor. We rate this False.	None	Marco Rubio	None	None	None	2012-07-16T11:04:30	2012-07-08	['United_States']
pomt-05926	Says with "Gov. Chris Christie and bipartisan reformers" New Jersey had "the most job growth in 11 years."	half-true	/new-jersey/statements/2012/jan/30/committee-our-childrens-future/chris-christies-record-touted-video-ad-committee-o/	A new ad depicts Trenton officials as a group of rowdy children who have marred their house with gummy carpets and chalk-strewn walls. But then Gov. Chris Christie arrives and straightens the place up in the 30-second spot released by Committee for Our Children’s Future, a nonprofit group that supports the governor. "For years, politicians have run amok in Trenton and cleaning up their mess hasn't been easy, but [with] Gov. Chris Christie and bipartisan reformers: the most job growth in 11 years, millions in new education funding, two budgets balanced," the narrator says in the ad released Jan. 25. "Christie and reformers are working to strengthen our economy, improve education and cut income taxes for all New Jersey families. Join our reform movement, because cleaning up is never easy, but it's worth it." PolitiFact New Jersey has addressed two of these claims previously: the governor increased education funding this year and he’s balanced two budgets, as he’s required to do. Now, we’re checking the claim that with Christie and bipartisan reformers, New Jersey had the "most job growth in 11 years." Brian Jones, a spokesman for Committee for Our Children’s Future, first sent us a Jan. 15 Asbury Park Press article to support the claim. It states that job growth last year "put the state on pace for its best year since 2000, when it added 77,100 jobs." But PolitiFact New Jersey’s analysis of the most recent state data, which is still subject to revision, doesn’t support that conclusion. Let’s look at job growth in the Garden State. In 2011, New Jersey gained 39,400 private-sector jobs and lost 3,000 government jobs. The net gain, then, was 36,400 jobs. In 2004, the state added 37,700 jobs of which 14,700 were from the public sector Prior to that, New Jersey had the most job growth in 2000, with an overall increase of 77,100 jobs. So, last year New Jersey had the highest total employment growth in seven years. When we reached back out to Jones, he said the statement in the ad was referring to private-sector employment, which grew more last year than in 11 years. "There’s been bloated government in Trenton for too long. Governor Christie’s policies are working to trim the fat, while growing private-sector jobs," he said. Joseph Seneca, a professor at the Edward J. Bloustein School of Planning and Public Policy at Rutgers University in New Brunswick, said it’s more appropriate to compare private-sector job growth now. In 2011, the state was purposefully "trying to reduce public-sector employment and the public sector in general," he said. "Whereas in 2004 it was sort of the Wild West, 40 percent of the total growth that year was in the public sector." As we’ve noted in previous rulings, it’s generally wrong to assign full credit or blame for job growth or job losses to specific individuals. While the governor and bipartisan reformers may have had a hand in creating more jobs other factors are at work, including the nation’s recovery from a job-destroying recession. Our ruling A group that supports the governor released a video ad that said with Christie and bipartisan reformers, New Jersey had "the most job growth in 11 years." The state gained more jobs overall last year than in seven years -- not 11 years. In 2004, the state added 37,700 jobs. In 2011, we added 36,400 jobs. Public-sector growth boosted job gains in 2004, while last year the state added jobs despite a decrease in government employment . The ad doesn’t make a distinction in the types of jobs gained, but a spokesman said it was referring to private-sector employment. Last year, New Jersey had the most private-sector job growth in 11 years. Overall, we rate this statement Half True. To comment on this ruling, go to NJ.com.

pomt-07833	"There is nothing in the current state public records law that prohibits sensitive or confidential business information from being just that, confidential."	true	/ohio/statements/2011/feb/15/matt-lundy/state-rep-matt-lundy-says-state-records-laws-alrea/	New Gov. John Kasich has made it clear his top priority while in office is to bring jobs to Ohio and turn the economy around. JobsOhio, a publicly funded, private nonprofit corporation, is Kasich’s big idea to attract businesses here and create jobs. The nonprofit corporation will act as a privatized version of the Department of Development’s economic development efforts. Yet the transition of this public agency, which Kasich has described as sluggish and ineffective, to the private sector has raised concerns about transparency and accountability. Kasich, a Republican, wants JobsOhio to be exempt from Ohio’s public records and open meetings laws. The corporation would be audited annually to show the public its spending. But Democrats have loudly criticized the exemptions, saying they would keep the corporation’s operations under wraps and out of the public view, inviting scandal and a misuse of taxpayers’ dollars. Kasich and other Republicans say the exemptions are needed to help JobsOhio "move at the speed of business." Public disclosure could disrupt business negotiations, they argue. State Rep. Matt Lundy, a Democrat from Elyria, is not convinced JobsOhio needs to be shielded from public records laws, and he has introduced legislation to subject the corporation to those rules. "There is nothing in the current state public records law that prohibits sensitive or confidential business information from being just that, confidential," Lundy said in a Feb. 7 news release announcing his legislation, which he called the Taxpayer’s Right to Know Act. Republicans control the Ohio House of Representatives, so Lundy’s bill is unlikely to get much attention. But since his effort highlights ongoing concerns about JobsOhio, PolitiFact Ohio decided to check out Lundy’s claim and examine how Ohio’s public records laws treat the state’s interactions with outside businesses. Ohio’s public records law, section 149.43 of Ohio Revised Code, establishes the public availability of records kept by public offices, whether its a city hall or local school district or the governor. The law also includes numerous exceptions, which range from a police officer’s home address to adoption records. These exceptions also apply to certain business records. Sensitive business records often fall within the "trade secrets" exception to Ohio’s public records law, said David Marburger, an attorney for Baker Hostetler in Cleveland and counsel for the Ohio Coalition for Open Government. Marburger, who often represents The Plain Dealer on issues of public access to government, called the trade secrets exception "extremely broad." Ohio Revised Code section 1333.61 defines a trade secret as any information, including business information, financial information, technical information, formulas, names addresses and telephone numbers, of actual or potential economic value. Marburger said the trade secret exception is a nearly impenetrable shield when a government entity and a business share sensitive or confidential information. Kent State University School of Journalism and Mass Communication professor Tim Smith agreed. He also cited the trade secrets exception when asked about Lundy’s statement. "From my knowledge about the open records law, Lundy’s statement is accurate," said Smith, a former managing editor for the Akron Beacon Journal. Kasich’s administration and Republicans in the House of Representatives, which already has approved the JobsOhio plan, have offered a cross-section of scenarios in which public disclosure would impede JobsOhio’s mission. (The Republican-controlled Ohio Senate is still reviewing the plan.) For example, if communication between JobsOhio and a sought-after company was public record, another states could use that information to trump Ohio’s offer. PolitiFact Ohio is not rating whether JobsOhio should be exempted from public records laws. Regardless of the advantages or disadvantages, Lundy’s statement that Ohio’s public records law includes exceptions that protect sensitive and confidential business information is correct. On the Truth-O-Meter it earns a rating of True.	None	Matt Lundy	None	None	None	2011-02-15T06:00:00	2011-02-07	['None']
pomt-09616	"More than 1,000 people ... move to Texas every day."	mostly true	/texas/statements/2010/jan/13/rick-perry/perry-says-1000-people-move-texas-daily/	Gov. Rick Perry touts Texas as a model state that escaped the recession with few battle scars and a lot of jobs, if you're looking for one. An unemployment rate significantly below the national rate is one reason folks are coming here — 1,000 people daily, according to Perry. "I am pleased to receive the endorsement of the Southwest Movers Association, which plays a key role in supporting the more than 1,000 people who move to Texas every day," he said Dec. 29. "As our state continues to grow, I look forward to working with members and stakeholders of SMA to ensure that Texas remains a top destination for job seekers." Matthew Thompson, a senior writer and editor at the Office of the Governor, said the governor's staff divided the state's annual population growth by 365 days to estimate how much the population swells daily. The statistics came from the U.S. Census Bureau. Between July 1, 2008 and July 1, 2009, Texas gained 478,012 more people — more than any other state (California, still boasting the biggest population overall, was second with 381,000 new people). That's about 1,300 people per day, by Thompson's calculation. But 478,000 is the net population change. It includes births as well as people relocating to Texas, after accounting for deaths and people leaving the state. So, what part of that net figure represents newcomers? With help from the U.S. Census Bureau, we learned that about 635 people come to Texas every day, on average. A census official based that number on average daily net migration from other states (393) plus average daily net migration from other countries (242). A separate estimate of the actual number of people entering the state comes from the Internal Revenue Service, which tracks the addresses of people who file taxes each year, and reports that information to the Census Bureau. The IRS found that 493,840 people switched their residence to Texas between the time they filed in 2007 and when they filed in 2008 — that's about 1,353 people each day. (The IRS' data are slightly older than the figures Perry cites as evidence for his claim.) In the end, Perry came close to getting it right, though he didn't take into account in-state births or people moving away. Statistically speaking, of course, a set number of people aren't moving to Texas every day because that number varies. But if you rely on IRS data collected in 2007 and 2008, more than 1,300 people on average were relocating here during that time frame. We rule Perry's claim Mostly True, even if he wasn't using the right data as evidence.	None	Rick Perry	None	None	None	2010-01-13T16:00:11	2009-12-29	['Texas']
pomt-08096	"One in 19 Americans today get SSDI or SSI. That's one in 19 Americans (who) are disabled."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/dec/14/tom-coburn/tom-coburn-says-one-every-19-americans-gets-ssdi-o/	At a Dec. 1, 2010, meeting of the National Commission on Fiscal Responsibility and Reform -- the Simpson-Bowles commission that was tasked with finding a solution for soaring deficits -- one of the panel's members, Sen. Tom Coburn, R-Okla., cited disability payments as an example how government spending has gotten "out of control." "We've created dependency," Coburn said. "And one great example is one in 19 Americans today get SSDI or SSI. That's one in 19 Americans (who) are disabled, and when the law says you're only disabled if there's no job in the economy you can perform, and we don't address that issue in this plan." We won't take sides on the question of whether SSDI and SSI should be cut or modified -- as Coburn and other critics have suggested, citing both cost and allegations of fraud by applicants -- but we were intrigued by the idea that more than 5 percent of Americans receive payments from one program or the other. We'd bet that most Americans who don't receive SSDI or SSI benefits are only dimly aware of these programs. Yet, if Coburn is right, these programs cover more than the percentage of Americans who are of Asian-American heritage (4.5 percent), more than double the number of American Jews (approximately 2 percent) and five times the number of American Indians (1 percent). So we decided to see if Coburn was right. First, some background on the two programs, both of which are run by the Social Security Administration. Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI) is funded by Social Security taxes paid by workers, employers and the self-employed. To be eligible for SSDI, a worker must have earned sufficient credits as a worker paying into the Social Security system. Typically, a worker will receive disability benefits if he or she becomes blind or disabled, or if a now-deceased spouse earned SSDI. Payments are based on the insured worker's Social Security earnings record. The program is set to pay out almost $124 billion in benefits this year. By contrast, Supplemental Security Income (SSI) is financed through general revenues rather than by taxes specifically paid into the Social Security system. SSI disability benefits are payable to adults or children who are disabled or blind, have limited income and resources and meet certain requirements on living arrangements. The monthly payment varies up to the maximum federal benefit rate, and it may be supplemented by state payments or decreased by other income. The federal government appropriated almost $46 billion for its share of benefits this year. Supporters say the programs provide needed support to the most vulnerable members of American society. But the programs have their share of critics, many of whom point to the steady increase in the programs' cost and the risk of abuse by people who are not truly too disabled to work. For purposes of consistency, we looked at the 2009 annual reports for each program, because both offered statistics for the same month -- December 2009. For that month, SSDI benefits were paid to 8.9 million recipients. SSI paid benefits that same month to 7.7 million people. Combined, that works out to 16.6 million people receiving benefits from one of the two programs in December 2009. If you divide that figure by the total United States population in 2009 of 307 million people, it works out to be 5.4 percent, or just slightly more than one out of every 19 Americans. But before we declare Coburn completely correct, let's look at how many people collect both SSDI and SSI. We couldn't find those numbers for December 2009, but for November 2010, the overlap was about 1.8 million people. If you assume that the number was roughly similar for December 2009, then 4.8 percent of the U.S. population receives either SSDI or SSI -- or one out of every 20.7 people. That makes Coburn very close, so we rate his statement Mostly True.	None	Tom Coburn	None	None	None	2010-12-14T15:58:58	2010-12-01	['United_States']
pomt-00072	"Mark Harris has said he would cut Social Security and Medicare."	half-true	/north-carolina/statements/2018/nov/01/dan-mccready/mccready-half-right-about-harris-wanting-cut-entit/	Seniors are among the most consistent election participants in part because they’re reliant on the largest U.S. safety net programs. So it would be politically risky for a candidate to declare his desire to cut Medicare and Social Security. And yet, Democrat Dan McCready recently accused Republican Mark Harris of admitting just that. Harris and McCready are running for North Carolina’s 9th Congressional District, which stretches from Charlotte to south-central North Carolina. It’s currently held by Robert Pittenger, who Harris beat in the Republican primary. There are 116,000 people in the 9th district over 65 (the age at which most people become eligible for Medicare and full Social Security benefits) and about 100,000 more who stand to collect Social Security benefits within the next 15 years, NC political expert Michael Bitzer recently told the Charlotte Observer. In a debate on Oct. 10, things got heated between Harris and McCready after a moderator asked about how they’d continue to pay for Social Security. "Mark Harris has said he would cut Social Security and Medicare," McCready said. The full debate is available on the Charlotte Observer website, and McCready made this claim around the 12-minute mark of the video. Harris said he was offended by McCready’s accusation. "I have never said that. That is a lie that’s being perpetrated throughout the campaign and throughout the district," Harris said. "I have always said we’ve got to keep Social Security solvent, we’ve got to make sure that it’s a promise made and a promise kept. And we will continue to do that." Harris then accused McCready of wanting to raise taxes to support those programs. He continued: "I do think we need to look at a graduated system that keeps the promise we’ve made to those that are retired and are heading toward retirement. I think when you get further back in the younger years, we need to have a graduated program that may involve options." McCready’s argument McCready then presented a three-pronged argument for how Harris has indicated intentions to cut Medicare and Social Security. "You supported a $1.9 trillion tax bill that takes $25 billion out of Medicare," McCready said to Harris. "You’ve said you would join the Freedom Caucus, whose stated purpose is to reform Social Security as we know it," McCready said. "And you said in 2014 at the Lake Norman debate that younger people would be the big loser under your plan." Harris responded by saying, "I’ve never expressed an overall plan except to make the point that younger people today who do not see Social Security being there when they reach it need to have some kind of options in place." Contacted by PolitiFact, McCready’s campaign emailed video of a 2014 U.S. Senate primary debate Harris participated in, a link to an online voter guide Harris filled out for this year’s primary and two news stories — by the Washington Post and Reuters — about how Republicans want to cut entitlement programs to compensate for revenue losses from the recent tax cut. The tax cuts and Freedom Caucus The Republican tax cuts are projected to shorten the life expectancy of the programs, as PolitiFact has previously reported. The tax law trimmed a year of solvency from the primary Medicare trust fund and had a negative effect on the Social Security trust fund, PolitiFact reported in a fact check of President Donald Trump. But it’s unfair for McCready to say that, because Harris supports the tax cuts, he by extension supports further cuts to Medicare. PolitiFact couldn’t find evidence that Harris has explicitly said he wants to cut Medicare, and McCready’s camp didn’t provide any. As for the Freedom Caucus, Harris has said he’d join the conservative group. Mark Meadows, a Freedom Caucus leader, says on his website that "Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid must be at the center of any serious proposal to return spending to sustainable levels." However, Meadows adds, "I do not support seriously proposing radical changes to current or soon-to-be retirees’ benefits. But if we are to continue providing these safety-nets for Americans in need we must renegotiate expectations with younger Americans. This could include increasing the retirement age for those just starting their careers, raising or eliminating the cap on payroll taxes for higher wage earners and creating incentives for personal retirement and health care savings." What has Harris said? Now let’s look at the 2014 debate and the voter guide. In the video of the debate, Harris sounds a lot like Meadows. Harris says everyone currently over 50 should be guaranteed that they will get Social Security when they retire, but younger people shouldn’t receive that same guarantee. "There may be a way that we’re able to scale back for others that are under 50. I’ll soon be 48, and … my generation may very well be the big loser in Social Security, but we may be able to say that at least I took care of my parents and my grandparents with what I paid into it." He continued: "I would rather, quite frankly, have you make the adjustment on me as a man about to turn 48, and free my children – age 25, 24, and 22 up – instead of continuing to tax them and put money into a system that they will never, ever see a dime out of it. So we’ve got to come up with a solution that will hit those generations and it’s got to be thoughtful and it’s got to be productive, but it is something that we can, we can work on and fix." Harris’ response to iVoterGuide.com — completed for the Republican primary in this race — is similar. Harris wrote that Social Security is "in a death spiral" and "needs to be overhauled." "However, we must honor our promises to existing retirees and those nearing retirement age keeping the current system in place for those folks," Harris wrote in the guide. "In order to sustain a system that resembles Social Security, the system will need to operate in a balanced manner meaning that individuals only receive what they pay in, supplemented if desired by a government budget that should be based not on the whims of political gain but economic sensibility." Our ruling McCready claimed Harris "has said he would cut Social Security and Medicare." PolitiFact couldn’t find an example of Harris describing a plan for changing Social Security and Medicare benefits for the people who get them now or stand to get them soon. On Medicare, McCready has failed to prove that Harris said he wants to cut the program at all. But on Social Security, it’s clear from his past and recent statements that his hopes for reform include changes that would limit future government payouts. Harris has used the word "overhaul" and said he’s open to scaling back Social Security for people under 50. However, he’s consistently said his desired reforms wouldn’t affect people who are in the program or stand to benefit from it in the next decade or so. We rate this claim Half True.

pomt-09475	"Charlie Crist was the only prominent Republican in the country to campaign with Barack Obama before the stimulus passed, on behalf of the stimulus."	half-true	/florida/statements/2010/mar/01/marco-rubio/crist-only-republican-campaign-obama-stimulus-rubi/	We've noticed a pattern in Marco Rubio's charges about Gov. Charlie Crist. Sometimes he criticizes Crist for supporting the stimulus. Other times, he criticizes Crist for supporting the stimulus and mentions that Crist hugged a Democrat who supported the stimulus (the president). And sometimes, he criticizes Crist for supporting the stimulus, mentions that Crist hugged a Democrat who supported it, and says Crist took the legs out from under Republicans who were pushing for an alternative. We suspect Rubio might repeat the attack one or two more times before the August primary. Here's a typical Rubio claim, from his Feb. 17, 2010 appearance on Fox News. "Charlie Crist was the only prominent Republican in the country to campaign with Barack Obama before the stimulus passed, on behalf of the stimulus," Rubio told interviewer Martha MacCallum. Congress passed the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, commonly called the stimulus, Feb. 13, 2009. The president signed the bill into law four days later at an event in Denver. (You can read PolitiFact's work about the stimulus here.) And as most everyone in Florida knows by now, Crist supported passing the stimulus, lobbied members of the state's congressional delegation to vote for it, and appeared at a town hall meeting with Obama in Fort Myers on Feb. 10, 2009. Crist earned our Pants On Fire rating for claiming that he "didn't endorse" the stimulus. In the Fox interview, Rubio attempted to set some pretty specific boundaries to his claim. The key phrases for us are "prominent Republican," "campaign with," and "before the stimulus passed." So by Rubio's logic, while California Republican Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger did support the stimulus, and continues to defend it, he never physically campaigned with Obama to drum up support for the bill. Connecticut Republican Gov. Jodi Rell also supported the stimulus -- she along with Schwarzenegger, Crist and Vermont Republican Gov. Jim Douglas signed a letter urging its passage -- but like Schwarzenegger, Rell did not appear at a rally with Obama. We're not sure if it's completely fair to exclude those Republicans, but as we chew on that, let's see what else is out there. Before the stimulus passed Congress on Feb. 13, Obama held five campaign-style events: Two events in Illinois on Feb. 12; An event in Springfield, Va., on Feb. 11; The Fort Myers event; A town hall meeting in Elkhart, Ind. on Feb. 9. We scoured the transcripts for each event looking for signs of Republican support. One of the Illinois events included Ray LaHood, a former Republican congressman. But LaHood is Obama's transportation secretary, so he really doesn't count. That event also included Republican U.S. Rep. Aaron Schock. But Schock voted against the stimulus bill. Indiana's town hall included Michigan GOP Rep. Fred Upton, but like Schock, he voted against the stimulus. That leaves Crist's appearance with Obama in Fort Myers. "I want to give a special thanks to your Governor, Charlie Crist, for joining us here today," Obama said at the Fort Myers rally. "The thing about governors is they understand our economic crisis in a way that maybe sometimes folks a little more removed don't understand. They're on the front lines dealing with the economy every single day. They're having to make choices about the budget every single day. They know what it means to balance a budget when revenues are short and more and more people are asking for help. And Governor Crist shares my conviction that creating jobs and turning this economy around is a mission that transcends party. And when the town is burning, you don't check party labels -- everybody needs to grab a hose. And that's what Charlie Crist is doing right here today." But that's not the only campaigning Obama did. On Feb. 2, 2009, Obama hosted Vermont's Douglas at the White House to discuss the stimulus. Before the meeting, Douglas and Obama spoke briefly to reporters. Here's part of what Douglas had to say: "The House of Representatives has passed a bill, and we look forward to working with your administration, with the senators and members of the House to fashion a piece of legislation that fulfills the goals that we have articulated. "I know there are some differences of opinion on some of the elements. And if I were writing it, it might be a little different. If you were writing it, it might be a little different. But the essence of a recovery package is essential to get our nation's economy moving." Douglas' comments were carried on cable news channels and included in an Associated Press story and later were picked up by the New York Times in a front-page article. (You can watch the interaction here. Sorry, no hug.) Douglas recently talked about his support for the stimulus with CNN. "What I said then is what I think most governors believe, that we might like it a little different," he told CNN's Candy Crowley. "Frankly, I was hoping there would be a little more for infrastructure, but -- but it was a package of relief that the states need urgently at a time when our state budgets were collapsing and we were facing the prospect of drastic cuts in state services or increases in taxes that wouldn't be fair or sustainable. So a recovery package was appropriate to stimulate the economy at that time last year." That prompted Massachusetts Gov. Deval Patrick, who was on the same same show with Douglas, to jump in. "Jim (Douglas) was -- Jim was great on this," Patrick, a Democrat, said. "As was Governor Crist -- very, very helpful." And that brings us back to Rubio's boundaries. Is Douglas prominent? As one of 24 Republican governors, Douglas certainly qualifies. Did he campaign with Obama? They held a media availability that was broadcast on CNN and CNBC. Was it before the stimulus passed? No doubt about it. We should note that Maine's two Republican senators, Olympia Snowe and Susan Collins , announced their support for the stimulus on Feb. 6, 2009, a week before the bill was passed. But they, like Schwarzenegger and Rell, did not attend any of the five campaign-style events. Yes, Republicans overwhelmingly opposed the federal stimulus bill. Not one House Republican voted for it. And at least five Republican governors -- including Sarah Palin of Alaska and Rick Perry of Texas -- urged the bill's defeat. But Rubio is stretching the truth by portraying Crist as a lone wolf. Four Republican governors announced their support of the stimulus, and three Republican senators (the third being then-Republican Arlen Specter) voted for the bill. The distinction with Crist is that Obama decided to hold a rally in Florida and not California. Rubio said Crist was the "only prominent Republican in the country to campaign with Barack Obama before the stimulus passed, on behalf of the stimulus." But Obama met with Vermont's Republican governor who then promoted the stimulus in nationally televised remarks. So while Rubio is right that Crist was an unusual Republican leader in endorsing the stimulus at a public event, he is wrong to say Crist was the only one. We rate his statement Half True.

pomt-09189	The federal government only ordered BP to pay "to do one of those six segments" of sand barriers for Louisiana.	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/jun/01/bobby-jindal/jindal-slams-feds-over-skepticism-about-louisianas/	Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal lamented the federal response to the state's plans to erect sand barriers to keep oil out of marshlands in the wake of the Deepwater Horizon disaster. Jindal talked about a meeting he had had with President Obama where Jindal explained what the state wanted from the feds. "The area we spent the most time was on our plan, the state's plan, to build sand booms to keep this oil out of our wetlands. Now, we have said for weeks now we'd much rather fight this oil on a sandy barrier island than fighting inside our wetlands. We've got miles and miles of these islands that have been eroded by Katrina, by storms, and over time. We proposed a plan, 24 segments, to rebuild, to refortify these islands. After weeks -- and if they'd approved this when we first asked, we could have built 10 miles, 10 miles of sand barriers." Host Jake Tapper interjected here: "The president says that more is not always better, and the Army Corps of Engineers took the request seriously, evaluated it, decided it was okay for certain areas, but they didn't necessarily think immediately the plan that was suggested was the right plan. Is that not a fair response?" "Yesterday, the Army Corps of Engineers approved 6 segments out of 24, over 40 miles out of 100," Jindal replied. "But here's where our concern was: The federal government only ordered BP to pay for to do one of those six segments. That's 2 miles out of 100. Our message to the president today was: Make BP pay for this. The federal government shouldn't be making excuses for BP. This is their spill, their oil. They're the responsible party. Make them responsible." We wanted to check Jindal's claim that the federal government only ordered BP to pay "to do one of those six segments." The Obama administration has said over and over that the oil company BP will pay for the clean up, and we wondered how to reconcile that with Jindal's statements. It turns out that Jindal is right about BP paying for one of six segments of sand barriers, but there's more to the story. As Tapper's comment suggested, the feds aren't so keen on the idea of building sand berms. Federal agencies are chiefly concerned that they can't be constructed quickly enough to intercept the oil, and that they will divert money and attention from other efforts. Nevertheless, on Thursday, May 27, 2010, U.S. Coast Guard Admiral Thad Allen said the government would give permission for the construction of six barriers and authorize BP to pay for one, as a test to see if the barrier plan is feasible. That one barrier would cost $16 million and be paid for by BP or the federal Oil Spill Liability Trust Fund. "Louisiana's original proposal called for the dredging of more than 92 million cubic yards of material over a six to nine month period to build temporary barrier islands," said a statement issued by the Deepwater Horizon Unified Command. The group approved a more limited project because "implementation of the proposal in all areas approved by the Army Corps of Engineers, in the midst of an active spill, would not be prudent or provide effective protection—especially considering the complications of a major construction project occurring in the midst of a response encompassing more than 20,000 personnel and 1,300 vessels." The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers listed 33 separate conditions that had to be met, including protections for navigation channels and wildlife. Allen said the approval was meant as a test case. "There are a lot of doubts whether this is a valid oil spill response technique, given the length of construction and so forth," he said. "But we're not averse to attempting this as a prototype." Some environmentalists also criticized initial proposals for dredging sand for the barriers too close to shore, according to a report in the Times-Picayune newspaper. After changes were made to address those concerns, the cost estimates for the barriers rose from $250 million to $350 million. The state government could move to build the barriers with state money, but Jindal has rejected that idea without a guarantee of reimbursement. So Jindal is right that the federal government has authorized payment for only one of six barriers. But he leaves out the fact that the government has doubts about the plan and whether it will work or not, and the first barrier is meant as a test case. We rate his statement Mostly True.

pomt-04554	Says Ted Cruz "has pledged to eliminate" the U.S. Department of Education, which would end federal aid to college students.	half-true	/texas/statements/2012/sep/27/paul-sadler/paul-sadler-says-ted-cruz-pledges-shut-down-depart/	Paul Sadler, the Democratic nominee for a U.S. Senate seat from Texas, casts his Republican opponent, Ted Cruz, as stumping on extremist ideas. And in a Sept. 26, 2012, press release, Sadler zeroed in on what he called Cruz’s desire to eliminate federal aid to college students. The release says Cruz has pledged to eliminate the U.S. Department of Education, "which would result in the loss of many programs used by Texas students." In the release, Sadler says: "The Department of Education includes federal student aid. If we eliminate it, then we truly make college education unaffordable for a large segment of our population in every single country, every single city, every single town." After asking Sadler spokeswoman Donna McDonald for the basis of Sadler’s claim, we looked for evidence of Cruz wanting to kill the agency, including its oversight of federal college student aid. Cruz has often called for eliminating several agencies including the education department. As noted in a May 6, 2012, Houston Chronicle news article, Cruz said at the Texas Capitol that day: "We need to eliminate unnecessary and unconstitutional agencies like the Department of Education ... the Department of Commerce, the Department of Energy, the National Endowment of the Arts. ... I would most like to eliminate the Internal Revenue Service." Later, in an Aug. 5, 2012, interview with Chris Wallace of Fox News, Cruz did not object when Wallace said, "You want to abolish (the) Education, Commerce and Energy departments" as well as the Transportation Security Administration and IRS. And in an interview posted Sept. 2, 2012, by the Daily Caller, a conservative-leaning news website, Cruz said: "I think we should shrink the size and power of the federal government by every and any means possible. What does that mean? That means eliminating unnecessary or unconstitutional agencies. The first agency I would eliminate would be the U.S. Department of Education. I think education is far too important to be governed by unelected bureaucrats in Washington. I think it should be at the state level, or even better, at the local level where parents have direct influence over the education of our kids." So, Cruz wants to wipe out the department, which originated in 1867 but did not become a Cabinet-level agency until 1980. And what does the agency do? It "establishes policy for, administers and coordinates most federal assistance to education," according to information on a department website. In 2007-08, department expenditures affected approximately 55 million students (pre-K through grade 12) in some 100,000 public schools and 34,000 private schools, the agency says, while providing grant, loan and work-study assistance to about 10 million undergraduate students. By telephone, Sadler told us Cruz’s saying he’d eliminate the department naturally means he would abandon all its functions -- including student aid. Sadler also pointed out a Sept. 25, 2012, El Paso Times news article quoting Cruz as saying he favors shutting down the agency and others. But it also quotes Cruz as saying that vital department functions such as teacher training would be pulled into other agencies. Minutes after we interviewed Sadler, he called us to point out a fresh news post by the Dallas Morning News on its Trailblazers blog. According to the Sept. 26, 2012, post, Cruz had just dismissed Sadler’s contention that eliminating the education department would jeopardize college student loan programs. "Of course not," the News’ post quotes Cruz as saying. "Student aid is critically important. … In my life, education opened doors for my parents and for me that never would’ve been opened." According to the post, Cruz said federal aid for college students should be wrested from the department and sent to the states as block grants. "We should take the funding, give it to the states and put the states in the position to make the decisions how to have the greatest impact in their communities," Cruz said. It would be unfair to consider information that came to light after Sadler made his claim. We won’t do so. Unfortunately, we failed to find any previous accounts of Cruz speaking to the department’s role in college student aid. To our inquiry, Cruz campaign spokesman James Bernsen told us by email that Cruz has "repeatedly made clear that he would not eliminate the funds to support a federal student loan program," preferring to give states "more freedom to adopt policies at the local level." More broadly, Bernsen said, the "elimination of a federal (agency) does not mean that critical divisions of the agency must be eliminated." We asked for evidence of Cruz’s repeated clarity about student financial aid, as described, and fielded none. Our ruling Sadler said Cruz wants to eliminate the U.S. Department of Education and that federal college student aid would vanish as a result. Cruz has been clear about wanting the agency gone -- and we also see the rationale behind saying, or speculating, that killing the department would end all its functions, including the provision of college aid. However, there is no record of Cruz confirming or even discussing that desire before the day Sadler issued this press release. Also, Cruz was recently quoted as saying he would preserve vital department functions such as teacher training, an indication he doesn’t favor dropping everything the agency does. We rate Sadler’s claim as Half True.	None	Paul Sadler	None	None	None	2012-09-27T15:53:29	2012-09-26	['Ted_Cruz']
pomt-02345	The United States stopped plans to build a missile defense shield in Eastern Europe "as a gift to Russia."	half-true	/punditfact/statements/2014/mar/23/mitt-romney/romney-obama-stopped-missile-defense-shield-gift-r/	President Barack Obama mocked Mitt Romney during the 2012 campaign for calling Russia "our No. 1 geopolitical foe." Now, as the country’s relationship with Russia worsens over Ukraine, Romney is getting the chance to take a few political swipes himself. Romney appeared on CBS’ Face the Nation on Sunday and said Obama has been naive about Russian President Vladimir Putin’s intentions all along. Romney said Putin has blocked Iran from harsher sanctions, stood with dictators in Syria and North Korea, and provided Edward Snowden a safe haven. Romney said he would have handled things differently. "For instance, you reconsider putting in our missile defense system back into the Czech Republic and Poland, as we once planned," Romney said of steps he’d take if he were in the White House. "And as you recall, we pulled that out as a gift to Russia." PunditFact has heard several Republican politicians and pundits bring up the missile defense system in recent weeks, so we wanted to look back into the program and why it was scrapped. The missile defense system The missile defense issue represented the first significant break from President George W. Bush administration policy in Obama’s first year in office, so it attracted a lot of attention. Bush, taking advice from Defense Secretary Robert Gates, pushed for an initiative to install 10 interceptor missiles on the ground in Poland and an advanced radar system in the Czech Republic to fend long-range missiles from Iran. American officials saw the Europe-based plan as improving their ability to deflect long-range missiles launched by Iran (not Russia) to Europe or the U.S while strengthening military partnerships with countries in Eastern Europe. Some interceptors had already been built on America’s West Coast to protect against nuclear attacks from North Korea. The interceptors in Europe would not be ready until at least 2017, Gates later wrote. The interceptors couldn’t do much against Russia’s nuclear weapons, experts said, but Russia still saw them as a threat to its arsenal and NATO-Russia cooperation. Russian defense minister Sergei Ivanov told a Belarus newspaper in 2006, "The choice of location for the deployment of those systems is dubious, to put it mildly," according to the New York Times. Enter Obama, who explained he supported the missile shield to Fox News host Bill O’Reilly during the 2008 campaign. He gave himself wiggle room, however, by saying, "I want to make sure it works, which is actually one of the problems we've got." He ordered a review. Washington’s relationship with Moscow was icy at the time following Russia’s war with Georgia. Obama took office in 2009 talking about hitting the "reset" button with Russia. Then, three years after Bush announced his missile defense proposal, Obama changed course. On Sept. 17, 2009, Obama announced that the United States would pursue a new missile defense policy focused on knocking out short- and medium-range missiles from sites closer to Iran. Russian concerns about the previous program were "entirely unfounded," Obama said. "Our clear and consistent focus has been the threat posed by Iran's ballistic missile program, and that continues to be our focus and the basis of the program that we're announcing today," Obama said. "In confronting that threat, we welcome Russians' cooperation to bring its missile defense capabilities into a broader defense of our common strategic interests, even as we continue to -- we continue our shared efforts to end Iran's illicit nuclear program." A ‘gift’ to Russia? Russians cheered the decision, though Russian officials said they didn’t promise anything in return. Putin called Obama’s move on the missile defense shield "correct and brave." Bush allies and congressional Republicans thought Obama caved. Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., Rep. Mike Pence, R-Ind. (who is now governor of Indiana), and Rep. John Boehner, R-Ohio, released statements along the lines of Obama is soft and let down American allies. Pundits like John Bolton, whom Bush appointed as ambassador to the United Nations, said Russia and Iran came away as "big winners" in a "bad day for American national security." Meanwhile, Israel and most NATO countries in Western Europe approved of the move, news stories show, as they thought the missile system provoked Russia. Initial reactions from Polish and Czech leaders were not thrilled. Obama delegated explaining the decision to an interesting source: Gates, the same official who recommended the missile defense plan to Bush in 2006 to combat the growing threat of Iranian ballistic missiles. Gates explained why he urged Obama to change course in a 2009 New York Times op-ed and in his 2014 book Duty, in which he described the new strategy as necessary due to changing times, technology and threats. (And in which he said some not-so-nice things about Obama.) "It was neither the first nor last time under Obama that I was used to provide political cover, but it was okay in this instance since I sincerely believed the new program was better -- more in accord with the political realities in Europe and more effective against the emerging Iranian threat," he wrote. Gates wrote that Defense Department officials realized the Iranian government was putting more stock into building short- and medium-range missiles over long-range ones. The agency wanted to uproot the old plan to better counteract that threat, and the new tactic Gates and Joint Chiefs of Staff recommended to Obama was not only cheaper, but the sea-based missiles could be more easily and quickly produced. "While there certainly were some in the State Department and the White House who believed the third site in Europe was incompatible with the Russian ‘reset,’ we in Defense did not," Gates wrote in Duty. "Making the Russians happy wasn’t exactly on my to-do list." Lost in the GOP fury, Gates wrote, was that Russians found Obama’s new approach to be an even bigger problem than the Bush-era plan as they worried about future adjustments that could make the short- and medium-range missiles a bigger threat to Russia. "How ironic that U.S. critics of the new approach had portrayed it as a big concession to the Russians," Gates wrote. "It would have been nice to hear a critic in Washington -- just once in my career -- say, Well I got that wrong." Lance Janda, chairman of the Department of History and Government at Cameron University, told us Romney’s comments are partially accurate. Yes, Obama ended the missile shield planned in Poland and Czech Republic, but the U.S. will address the ballistic missile threat with Aegis missiles in Eastern Europe by 2018, he said by email. "While our decision to cancel the sites in 2009 eased tensions with Russia -- which DEEPLY opposed the sites -- we also had legitimate security reasons for not moving forward and in that sense it's not like we were really doing Putin a ‘favor,’ " Janda said. "And we're certainly not leaving Poland or the Czech Republic exposed. They're covered by the rest of NATO and will get the Aegis system ... soon." We reached out to Romney through CBS and a press contact on MittRomney.com but did not hear back. Our ruling Romney said, the United States stopped plans to build a missile defense shield in Eastern Europe "as a gift to Russia." Romney’s impression about Obama’s decision to end the program is certainly shared by GOP politicians and pundits, and Obama took office with a vow to reset relations with Russia. Russia found Bush’s missile defense program in neighboring countries offensive and was pleased to see it go (though Gates asserts they dislike the new policy more). But Romney’s comments do not reflect the whole story. Gates, the Bush official who recommended the plan in 2006, acknowledged he drove the change in policy because of improved American intelligence of what the Iranians were working on -- not solely to be nice to the Russians. Plus, new defense systems are still planned. We rate the claim Half True.	None	Mitt Romney	None	None	None	2014-03-23T17:27:06	2014-03-23	['Russia', 'United_States', 'Eastern_Europe']
pomt-02607	In the past three years, state legislatures have "enacted more of these restrictions (on abortion) than in the previous 10 years combined."	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2014/jan/24/patty-murray/more-state-abortion-restrictions-were-enacted-last/	Forty-one years ago this week, the Supreme Court decided Roe vs. Wade, the landmark case that expanded women’s abortion rights. Fast forward to today, and access to abortion is still a hotly debated issue. Sen. Patty Murray, D-Wash., defended abortion rights in a statement on her website for the case’s Jan. 22 anniversary. "In 2013, our nation saw yet another record-breaking year of state legislatures passing restrictive legislation barring women’s access to abortion services," she said. "In fact, in the past three years, the United States has enacted more of these restrictions than in the previous 10 years combined." We wanted to zero in on the numbers of state abortion restrictions to see whether the number of restrictions skyrocketed over the last three years. Murray’s office didn’t return our requests for comment, but we found data compiled by the Guttmacher Institute, a nonprofit that promotes reproductive health and and abortion rights. The group first outlined the differences in abortion restrictions by year in a report released Jan. 2, 2014. Counting different provisions in the same bill independently, the group tallied 205 new abortion restrictions during the period 2011 to 2013, compared to 189 during the 10 years through 2010. Now, out of the 205 restrictions, there are 25 not currently in effect, either because a court struck them down or a court case is pending. Guttmacher tracked these all 205 restrictions in 10 categories, four of which accounted for nearly half of the restrictions from the last three years: abortion bans, regulations on abortion providers, abortion medication, and private insurance coverage for abortion. (Using the Guttmacher data, the Washington Post made their own handy breakdown of abortion restrictions by state.) For perspective, in 2000, Guttmacher considered the two most restrictive states to be Utah and Mississippi, both of which had restrictions on the books in five of the institute's 10 categories. By 2013, 22 states had five or more restrictions. Louisiana had restrictions in all 10 categories. Methodological differences mean there’s room for debate over the exact number of restrictions, even among abortion-rights groups. While Guttmacher reported 205 abortion restrictions over the last three years, the Center for Reproductive Rights counted approximately 130, said Amanda Allen, the center’s state legislative counsel. That’s because the Center for Reproductive Rights counted each bill just once, regardless of how many different provisions it may have included. The center hasn't been tracking the legislation since 2000, so they don't have a comparable number to pit against Guttmacher's 189 from that decade. While both groups that compiled the numbers are pro-abortion-rights, their figures aren’t being contested by the Susan B. Anthony List, an anti-abortion group. A spokeswoman for the Susan B. Anthony List told PolitiFact that the Guttmacher study "certainly appears to be accurate." Our ruling Murray said there have been more state-level abortion restrictions in the past three years than in the 10 years before that. A Guttmacher Institute report counted 205 restrictions from 2011 to 2013, compared to 189 from the previous decade. It's worth noting that 25 of those aren't currently in effect, but Murray specifically referred to restrictions enacted, not restrictions currently enforced. Both abortion-rights advocates and anti-abortion advocates told PolitiFact that they concur with Guttmacher's data. We rate her claim True.

pomt-09838	"If you're over 65 years old in America today, you have no choice but to be in Medicare. Even if you want out of Medicare, you have to forfeit your Social Security to get out of it."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/aug/24/dick-armey/dick-armeys-claim-about-medicare-and-social-securi/	To demonstrate how much control the government already has over our health care system, former House Republican Leader Dick Armey made this comment about Medicare on a recent episode of the NewsHour with Jim Lehrer : Senior citizens "see this as a hostile government takeover of all health care, where they will be forced into a government-run program, and their health care lives will be managed by the government, just as today's the case in Medicare," Armey, currently chair of FreedomWorks, a conservative activist group, said on the Aug. 13, 2009, episode. "If you're over 65 years old in America today, you have no choice but to be in Medicare. Even if you want out of Medicare, you have to forfeit your Social Security to get out of it." We wondered if the rules for Medicare were are rigid as Armey described, and, as usual with government programs, we found it's more complicated than we expected. First, we wanted to find out how Medicare enrollment works. According to the Social Security Web site, anyone who files for Social Security benefits at the age of 62 is automatically enrolled in Medicare Part A and B — coverage for hospital and doctor's visits, respectively — at the age of 65. Patients must enroll independently for private coverage or prescription drug benefits. In some cases, people never sign up for retirement benefits and therefore they must enroll in Medicare on their own, said Dorothy Clark, spokeswoman for the Social Security Administration. Either way, "Medicare is a voluntary program," said Clark. No one is ever required to sign up for government health benefits, nor are they required to keep them. Nevertheless, Armey is right that beneficiaries collecting Social Security will lose those payments if they drop Medicare Part A — so long as they were enrolled in both programs in the first place, Clark said. We were curious why Social Security and Medicare are linked, and when we asked, we found that the issue is the matter of a lawsuit that was brought against the Social Security Administration and the Department of Health and Human Services in 2008. Among the plaintiffs is none other than Dick Armey. The plaintiffs argue that, under the Medicare Act signed in 1965 and under the Social Security Act, there are no rules requiring enrollment in Medicare Part A to receive retirement benefits. Rather, a series of subsequent policy statements have linked the two programs, which are illegal because the two departments did not follow the traditional procedure to write the new rules, according to a press release issued by the plaintiffs on Oct. 9, 2008. The policy essentially traps retirees into participating. We asked the plaintiff's lawyer, Kent Masterson Brown, why the government had done this and he had a simple answer: power. "That's the curiosity here," Brown said. "[The departments] want to control every body." It turns out the NewsHour got a few viewer inquires angry that host Judy Woodruff did not do enough to challenge Armey on that point, according to Michael Getler, PBS ombudsman. Instead, Woodruff asked the other guest, Richard Kirsch with the liberal advocacy group Health Care for America Now, to challenge Armey's claim, but he didn't offer a specific rebuttal, leaving Armey's claim up in the air. So, back to Armey's claim. He's wrong that Medicare is required for everyone over the age of 65, but he's correct that those who want out of the program will lose their Social Security benefits as well. To us, that's a clear-cut Half True.	None	Dick Armey	None	None	None	2009-08-24T14:35:11	2009-08-13	['United_States', 'Medicare_(United_States)', 'Social_Security_(United_States)']
pomt-05054	"75 percent of the Obamacare tax falls on the middle class."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/jul/09/facebook-posts/facebook-post-says-75-percent-obamacare-tax-falls-/	In the wake of the Supreme Court’s decision upholding President Barack Obama’s health care law, many readers asked us to check a claim circulating on Facebook that "75 percent of the Obamacare tax falls on the middle class." The claim concerns the amount to be paid by Americans who decline to pay for health insurance under a provision of the health care law known as the individual mandate. Starting in 2014, individuals who do not buy insurance and who aren't exempt from the mandate (say, for cases of hardship or religious belief) will have to pay an annual penalty of at least $95 for an individual in 2014, rising to $325 in 2015 and $695 in 2016. After 2016, the amount would be indexed to inflation and could be higher -- 2.5 percent of household income, if that’s greater than the amount written into the law. The Congressional Budget Office and the Joint Committee on Taxation -- two nonpartisan federal offices -- have estimated that about 4 million uninsured Americans, including dependents, will have to pay up in 2016, amounting to $4 billion in revenue per year from 2017 to 2019. The individual mandate was at the heart of the legal challenge to the law, and the two parties have sparred over whether the sum to be paid by those who don’t get health insurance amounts to a penalty or a tax. (We ruled that the Supreme Court ruled that the individual mandate acts like a tax but stopped short of explicitly calling it a tax.) The Facebook post that readers sent us was created by the Tea Party Patriots, but it appears to originate from a comment made by Steve Moore, a member of the Wall Street Journal's editorial board, in a Fox News interview. "We found that about three-quarters of whatever you want to call them -- taxes, fines, penalties -- … will fall on the backs of families that make less than $120,000," Moore said in an interview on the show Fox and Friends. This number comes from the same CBO report cited above, in a table on page 73. So we delved into the numbers. CBO projected that 76 percent of people paying the tax penalty in 2016 will have a household income of 500 percent of the federal poverty level or below. By 2016, CBO expects the federal poverty level to be $24,000 for a family of four, so 500 percent of that would be $120,000, which is just as Moore said. So there is a grain of truth to this number. But there are a number of issues worth considering. First, the claim requires us to call a family of four earning $120,000 in 2016 "middle class." Is that reasonable? We looked at projections from the Urban Institute-Brookings Institution Tax Policy Center for what the federal income distribution will look like in 2016. A chart from the center estimates that the threshold for entering the top 20 percent of the income distribution in 2016 will be $123,970. So the Facebook post is essentially defining "middle class" as the bottom 80 percent of the income scale. Because there is no standard definition of "the middle class" -- and because politicians typically use the term broadly -- we won’t quibble with defining it this way. However, we do think it’s worth noting that this definition includes poor Americans as well as ones that can be defined as "middle class." The second concern is more problematic. CBO offers another measurement that is probably a more appropriate yardstick for the Facebook post’s claim -- a tally of dollars paid rather than the number of households that have to pay. CBO projected that 46 percent of the tax dollars collected as a result of the individual mandate will come from the bottom 80 percent, compared to 55 percent that will come from the top 20 percent. This presents a very different picture of how the financial burden of the mandate will be borne. There’s a big difference between the "middle class" carrying 75 percent of the burden rather than 46 percent of the burden. Two tax experts -- Roberton Williams of the Tax Policy Center and William McBride of the Tax Foundation -- agreed with our analysis. They also indicated that, given the phrasing of the Facebook post, it’s more appropriate to use dollars paid than the number of households that have to pay the penalty. "It's a complete misinterpretation of what CBO said," Williams told PolitiFact. Third, while we think it’s pretty clear from the context of Moore’s interview that he’s talking about the individual mandate alone, the Facebook post doesn’t carry over that nuance. The Facebook post could be interpreted to mean all taxes stemming from the health care law. Collectively, these new taxes are a lot bigger than the individual mandate tax -- and two of the biggest of them are specifically geared toward upper-income taxpayers. According to the Joint Committee on Taxation: • Starting in 2013, Medicare payroll taxes increase 0.9 percentage points for people with incomes over $200,000 ($250,000 for couples filing jointly). Also, people at this income level would pay a new 3.8 percent tax on investment income. The 10-year cost: $210.2 billion. • Starting in 2018, a new 40 percent excise tax on high-cost health plans, so-called "Cadillac plans" (over $10,200 for individuals, $27,500 for families), kicks in. That's expected to bring the government a total of $32 billion in 2018 and 2019. For other newly imposed taxes in the law, it’s less clear how the burden will fall. These taxes include a fee for pharmaceutical manufacturers and importers ($27 billion over 10 years); an excise tax on manufacturers and importers of medical devices ($20 billion over 10 years); an annual fee on health insurance providers begins ($60.1 billion over 10 years); a higher floor for medical expense deductions on itemized income tax returns ($15.2 billion over 10 years); and an excise tax on indoor tanning services ($2.7 billion over 10 years). Our ruling The Facebook post said that "75 percent of the Obamacare tax falls on the middle class." While it’s true that 75 to 80 percent of the households paying the individual mandate penalty might be described as "middle class," those households will only foot 45 percent of the bill -- a big difference. In addition, the Facebook post is worded vaguely enough to suggest that 75 percent of all the taxes in the health care bill will fall on the middle class. And that would be wrong. We rate the statement False.	None	Facebook posts	None	None	None	2012-07-09T11:09:35	2012-07-03	['None']
pomt-05386	The U.S. economy is "recovering slower than Europe "	false	/virginia/statements/2012/may/07/bob-mcdonnell/bob-mcdonnell-says-us-trails-europe-economic-recov/	Gov. Bob McDonnell recently added a new argument to his contention that President Barack Obama’s economic policies have failed. "We’re recovering slower than Europe and other Western countries because I think our policies for jobs and energy are just anemic with this White House," McDonnell said in an April 21 interview on Bloomberg TV. The economic news from abroad is hardly inspiring these days: crushing Greek debt; 24 percent unemployment in Spain; Britain falling back into recession. So we wondered whether the United States’ recovery really is trailing Europe’s. We asked the governor’s office for proof of McDonnell’s European claim and asked it to identify the "other Western countries" he referred to. Spokeswoman Taylor Thornley sent us an email with no answers, but saying, "Unemployment is too high. The national debt is out of control. And too many people are out of work." So we turned to data tables. Economists told us a standard way to examine the pace of the economy is to examine growth in gross domestic product -- the value of all goods and services produced in a country. At the time McDonnell made his statement, quarterly GDP figures through the end of 2011 were the latest ones available. Tables from the European Union’s economics statistics office show the 27 countries in the European Union, on average, were growing faster than the U.S. in the first quarter of 2011 and that trends evened out in the second quarter. In the second half of last year, U.S. GDP was rising at a faster clip than Europe. In the EU, GDP rose 1.1 percent in the third quarter of 2011 and but dropped 1 percent in the fourth quarter. The U.S., saw its economic output rise 1.8 percent in the third quarter and 3 percent in the fourth quarter. Only five of 33 European nations grew faster than the U.S. in the second half of 2011: Poland, Iceland, Slovakia, Latvia and Lithuania. Iceland is not a member of the EU. In the weeks and days before McDonnell made his statement, international organizations that track the global economy released growth projections for the U.S. and Europe for this year. Figures released on April 17 by the International Monetary Fund show that U.S. GDP in 2012 is expected to grow 2.1 percent in 2012. That’s a bit quicker than the 1.7 percent increase the U.S. saw through all of 2011. Throughout Europe, GDP grew 2 percent in 2011, but that is expected fall to 0.2 percent this year. On March 29, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, an international group representing three dozen developed nations, released its projections for GDP growth in the first half of 2012. "Our forecast for the first half of 2012 points to robust growth in the United States and Canada, but much weaker activity in Europe where the outlook remains fragile," Pier Carlo Padoan, the OECD’s chief economist said in a news release. Figures in the report show that U.S. GDP growth at the end of 2011 was outpacing the major economies in Europe -- Germany, France, Italy and the United Kingdom -- which were shrinking or barely growing. Through the first half of 2012, U.S. growth was expected to outpace all those European nations. Desmond Lachman, a resident fellow at the conservative American Enterprise Institute, said McDonnell is off base when he asserts Europe is recovering faster than the U.S. "The United States, while its growth has not been spectacular, it certainly is growing modestly," Lachman said. "Europe has just moved into recession. The last two quarters in Europe, many of the countries, you had negative growth." Only four European nations -- Poland, Iceland, Turkey and the Slovak Republic -- are expected to see their GDP rise at a faster clip than the U.S. this year, according to IMF data. We also looked at unemployment rates in the U.S. and the European Union. We were unable to make an exact comparison because not all European nations define unemployment the same way as the U.S. This much is clear, however: The unemployment rate in European Union Nations rose from 9.4 percent in March 2011 to 10.2 percent in March 2012. During the same two months, the U.S. rate fell from 8.9 percent to 8.2 percent. Our ruling McDonnell said the U.S. recovery is slower than Europe’s. But looking at the continent as a whole the opposite is true. U.S. economic growth gained steam during the second half of 2011 while Europe’s started to flag. This year U.S. GDP is expected to grow at a higher pace than last year while Europe’s growth, is expected to be flat. Only five outpaced the United States in economic growth during the last half of 2011. Only four are expected to outperform the U.S. this year. This information was available before the governor made his comment. We rate McDonnell’s statement False.	None	Bob McDonnell	None	None	None	2012-05-07T06:00:00	2012-04-21	['United_States', 'Europe']
pomt-05897	Says Gov. Scott Walker "made more than $70 million in cuts to job training programs through (Wisconsin’s) technical colleges."	half-true	/wisconsin/statements/2012/feb/05/fred-clark/democratic-state-rep-fred-clark-says-gov-scott-wal/	In the wake of six straight months of job losses, Republican Gov. Scott Walker put a priority on training workers to fill existing jobs in his Jan. 25, 2012, state of the state speech. Two weeks earlier, Walker had announced a new council to brainstorm ways to get students better prepared for jobs. Not surprisingly, Democrats weren’t buying what Walker was selling. In the weekly Democratic Party radio address released Feb. 1, 2012, state Rep. Fred Clark of Baraboo pointed to the lackluster jobs numbers and criticized Walker’s policies on education. He said students are "already experiencing the effects of Governor Walker’s damaging cuts to our universities and our technical colleges." Clark continued: "Governor Walker’s talk about job training rings very hollow after he made more than $70 million in cuts to job training programs through our technical colleges." We’ve heard plenty about Walker’s budget as it relates to public schools and the state university system, but little about the state’s technical college system, which quietly serves 375,000 students. Did Walker cut technical college job training programs by $70 million? Walker’s budget, approved by the Republican-controlled Legislature, did cut more than $70 million from general state aid to the technical college system. Precisely, it was $35.8 million each year for two years, or $71.6 million, according to the Legislative Fiscal Bureau. After years of steady state funding, Walker’s plan amounted to a 30 percent reduction in state aid over two years. The reduction put the state aid at 1989 levels, according to tech college officials. The state budget also froze for two years the amount colleges could levy in property taxes for their budgets. That added to the budget challenge for administrators. But there are some key additional facts to put this into context. The state money is only about 12 percent of the revenue base for the colleges. Property taxes provide two-thirds of their budgets, and tuition and fees about one-fifth. So, it was a 30 percent cut of that narrow portion of their overall budget. And there is another set of numbers, unmentioned by Clark, that is important here. Most of the officials we spoke with acknowledged that another Walker budget move -- the collective bargaining changes that resulted in greater public employee contributions to state-paid health insurance and pensions -- had partially offset the aid cuts. Statewide, across the colleges, an estimated 60 percent of the aid cut was offset by those cost-cutting moves, according to Morna Foy, vice president of policy and government relations for the Wisconsin Technical College System. She noted the impact varied widely depending on the timing of labor contracts and other factors. So the impact of the $70 million aid cut was significantly offset. Additionally, Clark described the budget move as "more than $70 million in cuts to job training programs." The tech system’s primary mission is largely "job training" through specialized coursework. But that’s not all those schools do. They also provide general education, career counseling and skills training for already employed workers, among other services. So it’s impossible to say the $70 million all came from job training programs. Because nobody has catalogued the college-by-college impact of the aid cuts, we can’t rule on whether the state aid cuts have damaged tech college education, as Clark said. But our interviews with a sample of the 16 technical college districts found a modest but significant list of program cutbacks officials attributed to the state aid cut: Northeast Wisconsin Technical College lost about 5 percent of its workforce, including eight instructors, made some class sizes bigger and cut back on counseling for students and extra help for students who struggle, said Karen Smits, vice president of college advancement. Waukesha County Technical College discontinued two course programs, said Kaylen Betzig, executive vice president. Milwaukee Area Technical College consolidated a majority of classes at its downtown campus, according to Kathleen Hohl, spokeswoman for the college. Officials with the state tech system officials found that closing class sections and reducing the number of instructors was a common budget-balancing tactic, as was dipping into reserve funds, said Foy. Several officials mentioned waiting lists to get into programs such as nursing, and said the cuts have thwarted plans to try to get more students into class. In tough economic times, demand for tech classes rises, officials said. They also said Walker’s budget spurred extraordinary numbers of retirements, causing the loss of experienced teachers. But officials said the overall impact on classrooms was pretty modest or negligible. "Students were able to get the experience in classroom we have always offered," Smits said, emphasizing that outside the classroom, the guidance cuts did mean less service. Our conclusion Clark correctly quantified Walker’s budget as having made more than $70 million in cuts to the technical college system. But it was a cut in general aid, not specifically to job training programs. And some of the cut was significantly offset by other changes in the budget, as was evident when officials told us the impact of the cuts was relatively modest. We rate Clark’s statement Half True.

pomt-04716	At Bain Capital, "we helped start an early childhood learning company called Bright Horizons that First Lady Michelle Obama rightly praised."	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/aug/31/mitt-romney/mitt-romney-says-michelle-obama-praised-bain-compa/	Mitt Romney said one of his Bain Capital companies has been so successful it's been praised by First Lady Michelle Obama. Romney’s Aug. 30, 2012, speech at the Republican National Convention in Tampa extolled Bain Capital, the private equity and venture capital firm that fueled his wealth, as "a great American success story." "Some of the companies we helped start are names you know you've have heard from tonight. An office company called Staples, where I'm pleased to see the Obama campaign has been shopping. "The Sports Authority, which of course became a favorite of my boys. "We helped start an early childhood learning company called Bright Horizons that First Lady Michelle Obama rightly praised. "And at a time when nobody thought we'd ever see a new steel mill built in America, we took a chance and build one in the cornfield in Indiana. Today, Steel Dynamics is one of the largest steel producers in the United States. These are American success stories." What did Michelle Obama say? Let’s Move! We asked Romney’s campaign, and did some searching of our own. The first lady didn’t offer a blanket endorsement of Bright Horizons, a major provider of employer-sponsored child care that’s been named one of Fortune magazine’s "100 Best Companies to Work for in America." Rather, she singled them out for a mention in a June 2011 speech in Washington, D.C., as a new partner for her healthy-kids initiative, Let’s Move. Her comments were publicized a year later in a Daily Caller article headlined "Michelle Obama praised Bain Capital-backed child care company," as well as by ABC News and Fox Business News with Neil Cavuto. She was "singing the praises of a company called Bright Horizons last year" saying it was "it was beyond just first-rate," Cavuto said. The coverage focused on a YouTube video that showed the first lady mentioning Bright Horizons . She had visited a child care center — not one managed by Bright Horizons, but rather an unrelated center called CentroNia — to announce "Let’s Move Child Care." Providers such as Bright Horizons had agreed to sign on with Partnership for a Healthier America to focus on nutrition and exercise in their centers. Michelle Obama said: "The Partnership for a Healthier America is working with private providers like Bright Horizons. That’s the nation’s second largest private child care provider, and they’re going to implement this checklist at nearly 600 child care centers across the country. So we already have commitments that are going to affect hundreds of thousands of children today. Again, that’s why we’re excited to be able to launch this. That's why these partners here today are so important, because we wouldn't have this announcement if we didn't have the folks ready to step up and invest and get the ball rolling and be the models, as CentroNia is, to show that we can do this, and it can work." In a related Bright Horizons news release, she was quoted as saying, "If our kids get into the habit of getting up and playing, if their palates warm up to veggies at an early age, and if they’re not glued to a TV screen all day, they’re on their way to healthy habits for life. That’s why I’m so excited about Let’s Move Child Care – because I know that childcare facilities and home-based providers can be a real building block for an entire generation of healthy kids." Our ruling Romney said the first lady "praised" Bright Horizons. She did say that she was "excited" to launch an initiative that included the child care provider, calling Let’s Move partners "so important." Those are favorable comments about the company.

pomt-14248	Florida’s regulations on the payday lending industry are "stronger than almost any other state."	false	/florida/statements/2016/apr/12/patrick-murphy/patrick-murphy-praises-floridas-payday-law-stronge/	Consumer groups have attacked Florida members of Congress, including Patrick Murphy, for defending a payday lending bill that they say traps the poor in a cycle of debt. Murphy, a Democrat who represents the Treasure Coast and is running for U.S. Senate, disagrees with those consumer advocates. "The regulations on the (payday lending) industry are some of the strongest here in Florida, stronger than almost any other state," Murphy said in a conference call with reporters April 6. The position of Democratic lawmakers on payday loans has been a hot topic in Florida. We will fact-check Murphy’s claim that Florida’s payday lending law is "stronger than almost any other state." We found that consumer groups, independent researchers at Pew Charitable Trusts and the federal Consumer Financial Protection Bureau have raised multiple criticisms of Florida’s law. No expert we interviewed consider Florida’s law to be "stronger than almost any other state." Florida’s payday lending law Payday loans are small, short-term loans that borrowers promise to repay out of their next paycheck at a high rate of interest. About three dozen states have their own payday laws, including Florida. President Barack Obama took a step toward regulating payday lenders when he signed a bill in 2010 that included the creation of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. The bureau released an outline of payday loan rules in 2015 and will release a more complete proposal this year. The bureau’s goal is to make sure consumers have the ability to repay their loans -- something experts say Florida’s law fails to do. (The bureau can’t cap rates -- something only Congress or states have the authority to do.) Nearly all of Florida’s congressional delegation, including Murphy, signed a letter in April 2015 asking the bureau to use Florida’s law as a model. U.S. Rep. Dennis Ross, a Florida Republican, filed a bill in November which would give precedence to state laws. Murphy is one of 24 cosponsors on the bill, which hasn’t had a hearing yet. Murphy’s Democratic primary opponent for the U.S. Senate, U.S. Rep. Alan Grayson, signed the April letter but now says he will oppose the bill in its final version because it contains a waiting period on federal regulations. Consumer groups, researchers criticize Florida’s law Consumer advocates say that Florida’s payday law is no model. More than 200 consumer or civil rights groups -- including the NAACP, National Council of La Raza, Southern Poverty Law Center, and the Consumer Federation of America -- wrote a letter to Congress arguing that the "industry-backed Florida law" would hurt consumers. Among nine groups from Florida fighting the law is the Florida Alliance for Consumer Protection. In Florida, "In exchange for minimal regulatory requirements, the industry was permitted to issue predatory loans, extracting millions in exorbitant fees each year from the Floridians that can least afford it," stated the group in May 2015. Florida’s 2001 payday loan law included protections that were intended to help the poor. But the loans leave consumers stuck on a debt treadmill in Florida, where they have racked up $2.5 billion in fees since 2005, according to the Center for Responsible Lending. The center obtained data from the state Office of Financial Regulation to examine payday transaction data for a 10-year period. The average Florida payday loan had an annual rate of 278 percent in 2014-15, the center found. Pew Charitable Trusts, an independent organization, has researched payday laws for five years, including interviews with borrower focus groups. Borrowers consistently say they want small installment payments, lower prices and certainty of quick approval. Florida has quick approval, but otherwise doesn’t meet those benchmarks, said Alex Horowitz, senior officer with the small-dollar loans project. Colorado is the only state that achieves all three. "Colorado has by far the best model for payday loans in the country," Horowitz said. In Florida, loans are due back in a lump sum by the borrower’s next payday that take up on average 35 percent of a borrower’s paycheck. "That is much more than they can afford," Horowitz said. Colorado’s 2010 law led to more affordable loan payments, fewer defaults, and lower prices, according to Pew. A spokesman for Murphy, Joshua Karp, pointed to a 2014 analysis by Pew that placed states into three categories: 15 states have no payday laws, 27 states have permissive laws and nine states are "hybrids," with requirements such as lower limits on fees or longer repayment periods. "Florida's law is stronger than 27 of 35 states that allow payday lending," Karp said. But Horowitz said that in most cases there is insufficient research to know if the restrictions in the nine states improve consumer welfare. The Center for Responsible Lending doesn’t consider Colorado to be a national model because it allows high interest rates, said Diane Standaert, the center’s director of state policy. The best practice is a rate cap of 36 percent, which exists in 14 states but not Florida, she said. "The data from Florida is it has some of weakest provisions in the country," she said. The director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, Richard Cordray, disagreed with Ross, a Florida congressman, when Ross called Florida’s law the "gold standard" during a congressional hearing on March 16. In Florida, "these loans are still being made above the 300 percent, and they are being rolled over on average nine times," Cordray said. Of course, Florida’s law could always be worse. For example, eight states including Wisconsin and Texas have no fee limits, while in Florida it is $35 to borrow $300 for two weeks. However, no academic or consumer expert we interviewed argued that Florida’s law should be considered any sort of national model. "One can’t say across the board Florida is a state that has somehow reined in payday lenders in comparison with other states," said Auburn University professor James Barth who wrote a paper on payday lending. Our ruling Murphy said Florida’s regulations on the payday lending industry are "stronger than almost any other state." Consumer advocates, Pew researchers and the head of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau have several criticisms of Florida’s law, including the high interest rate. Pew, an independent organization, says that Colorado has the best model law in the country. The Center for Responsible Lending points to 14 states -- not including Florida -- that cap interest rates at 36 percent as a better practice. There are ways in which Florida’s payday law is better than some other states, but there is not evidence that it’s stronger than almost any other state.

pomt-10677	"The estate tax, which came into being by Republicans like Teddy Roosevelt and others ... is there for a real simple reason: In America, we've never liked the idea of massive inherited wealth."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2007/dec/18/hillary-clinton/need-not-wealth-prompted-estate-taxes/	To justify her plan to use estate tax revenues for universal retirement accounts, Hillary Clinton told a voter in New Hampshire that history was on her side. "People disagree about this, but the estate tax, which came into being by Republicans like Teddy Roosevelt and others, and has been part of our tax system for a very long time, is there for a real simple reason: In America, we've never liked the idea of massive inherited wealth," she said during a town hall forum in Derry. "Part of the reason why America has always remained a meritocracy where you have to work for what you get ... is that we never had a class of people sitting on generation after generation after generation of huge inherited wealth." Clinton's historical account, and dig at Republicans, shows selective memory. Estate taxes — a tax on the property passed forward and received at death — were first levied in 1797 under President John Adams, a Federalist. In that case, the revenue went to cover the cost of raising a Navy. The two subsequent times it was enacted, in 1862 and 1898, it paid for military conflicts (first the Civil War and then the Spanish-American War), before being repealed again. Clinton is correct that Republican Theodore Roosevelt advocated renewing the estate tax. On Dec. 4, 1906, he told Congress, "The man of great wealth owes a peculiar obligation to the State, because he derives special advantages from the mere existence of government." But Roosevelt left office before it became law in 1916 — under President Woodrow Wilson, a Democrat, who used the tax to help pay for World War I. Another Democrat, Franklin Delano Roosevelt, raised rates twice, in 1934 and 1935, to help fund federal programs during the Great Depression. At that time, he said, "The transmission from generation to generation of vast fortunes by will, inheritance, or gift is not consistent with the ideals and sentiments of the American people." Since then, the estate tax has continued to increase as have the number and size of the exemptions. Under tax cuts passed by President Bush, it is being phased out by 2010. Clinton wants to abolish the tax cuts she said only help the wealthy and use the estate tax to fund a new retirement system. While her sentiment closely resembles FDR's, her statements don't represent the full history behind the tax. We rule her statement Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.

"‘It’s only a matter of time before we can own colored people again’ says NRA President Jim Porter," read the headline on a Feb. 27, 2017, post on BlackInsuranceNews.com. The site describes itself as a source of insurance industry news for minority communities. The story, which is made up as well as outdated, says Porter called President Barack Obama a "fake president" and referred to the Civil War as "the War of Northern Aggression." In addition to the quote in the headline, the post claims Porter also said, "I don’t want my grandkids growing up taking orders from a colored man. It’s our God-given right to keep them as property and keep them in line." The Associated Press described Porter in 2013 as having "a penchant for bold statements." He told NRA supporters before officially taking office that they were part of a "culture war" that was bigger than just gun rights. Porter was succeeded as NRA president in 2015 by Allan Cors. The BlackInsuranceNews.com post was flagged by Facebook as possibly being fake as part of the social media company’s efforts to weed out fake stories in its news feeds. The BlackInsuranceNews.com story was very popular on Facebook. It’s been shared more than 68,000 times since being posted Monday, according to Facebook. But it actually originates from a joke site called FreeWoodPost.com, which first posted the story on May 5, 2013, the same week Porter was installed as NRA president. FreeWoodPost.com makes no secret that its contents aren’t serious. The site’s slogan is "News that’s almost reliable," and each post (including the one about Porter) notes beneath the text that "this story is satire, folks." The site also has a disclaimer that says FreeWoodPost.com "is a news and political satire web publication, which may or may not use real names, often in semi-real or mostly fictitious ways." The articles "are fiction, and presumably fake news," it says. BlackInsuranceNews.com, meanwhile, carries no such disclaimer. The site did not respond to our request for comment.

pomt-12789	"If Governor Cooper's proposed bill for repealing HB2 becomes law, it will create a state-sanctioned 'Look But Don't Touch' policy in our bathrooms."	pants on fire!	/north-carolina/statements/2017/feb/16/dan-forest/ncs-dan-forest-wrongly-claims-gov-roy-cooper-will-/	After Gov. Roy Cooper introduced a proposal repealing House Bill 2, one of the law’s biggest supporters spoke up. Republican Lt. Gov. Dan Forest – who has already announced he wants to run for governor in 2020 – said Cooper’s strategy to repeal HB2 "will risk the safety of our people to achieve a radical social policy agenda." HB2 said people can only use the bathrooms of their birth gender (not their gender identity), and it banned cities and counties around North Carolina from creating rules related to bathroom access or discrimination protections for LGBT people, or raising the minimum wage. We previously found that there’s no real history of safety problems associated with transgender-friendly bathroom rules. However, Forest’s claim doubled down on such concerns. "If Governor Cooper's proposed bill for repealing HB2 becomes law, it will create a state-sanctioned 'Look But Don't Touch' policy in our bathrooms," Forest said in a written statement. "Heterosexual men will be able to access women's showers and bathrooms by simply posing as a transgender individual. They will be able to watch women and children shower, or shower next to them. As long as the man doesn't touch them, assault them or film them, no legal protection would be afforded the offended woman or child. Nothing." That’s a shocking claim. We found it’s also not based in reality. What happens if HB2 gets repealed We should note one thing right off the bat: Forest issued his statement on Cooper’s bill before the bill was filed, basing his claim simply off what Cooper said in a press conference. That means we won’t use the bill itself to examine Forest’s claim. Instead, we’ll use the facts that existed at the time – including that Cooper had proposed repealing HB2 and strengthening criminal penalties for certain crimes committed in bathrooms. His statement implies Cooper proposed letting transgender people use the bathroom of the gender with which they identify. That’s not true. In reality, Cooper suggested a return to the status quo that North Carolina used for centuries, in which there were no laws about bathroom access. We asked Forest spokesman Jamey Falkenbury if Forest thought that North Carolina had a "state-sanctioned ‘Look But Don’t Touch’ policy" for all that time. Falkenbury said Forest was instead making the assumption that, once HB2 is repealed, cities and counties will rush to pass transgender-friendly bathroom rules. We can’t see the future, and neither can Forest, although Falkenbury did correctly point out that "with HB2 repealed there would be no legal mechanism to block those ordinances." Yet even if that did happen the decision is up to local governments, and the rules would only apply locally. That’s hardly a "state-sanctioned" policy, contrary to Forest’s claim. Law enforcement doesn’t lack power We looked into legal protections for two different possibilities: What powers law enforcement will have under the situation Cooper actually proposed, as well as under the situation Forest believes might happen. That first one is easy. There are a number of laws the state can use to protect people from the kinds of acts Forest described. There might be more, but at least six could apply: Trespassing, stalking, breaking and entering, indecent exposure, secret peeping and sex offender restrictions. And since HB2 contains no civil or criminal penalties for violations, repealing it wouldn’t take away any legal protections. If the sexual predators in Forest’s scenarios are also convicted sex offenders, the state has laws to give them additional punishments for re-offending, or even for simply being near places kids go – including pools, schools and other places with the kind of shared facilities Forest is worried about. And in 2015, before HB2 passed, UNC-Chapel Hill law professor Jeff Welty wrote about what could happen to people go into the wrong bathroom. Welty said there’s "a strong argument" for trespassing and "a reasonable argument" for breaking and entering. He also cited a 2008 trial in which a 15-year-old boy in Greenville was convicted of trespassing for barging into his school’s girls’ locker room. The boy was also charged with secret peeping but wasn’t convicted, as he was anything but secretive in causing a scene. So all that debunks one of Forest's concerns, of a man watching women undress with no legal consequences if HB2 is repealed. There absolutely would be legal protections. And Forest’s more extreme scenario, of men being able to undress or shower with women, is even more ludicrous. North Carolina’s indecent exposure law would apply, and would lead to felony charges if children were present. Trying to see the future But what about if a city took advantage of the HB2 repeal and allowed transgender people to use the bathroom of the gender with which they identify? Let’s examine the possibilities. We began by asking why Forest ignored Cooper’s proposal for stronger penalties for bathroom crimes. That was intended as an olive branch to Republicans; it also caused the liberal, pro-LGBT groups Human Rights Campaign and Equality NC to oppose Cooper’s proposal. Falkenbury said it’s because Forest believes those laws would become meaningless. If a man claimed he was feeling like a woman at that particular moment in time, Falkenbury said, the law would be powerless to stop him. Again, we should point out Cooper never proposed allowing transgender people into restrooms based on their gender identity – and he has refused to publicly support other Democrats’ proposals to do so – but we’ll look into it anyway. Forest can’t possibly have any North Carolina-specific proof, since nowhere in the state has ever had transgender-friendly bathroom rules (Charlotte tried to, but HB2 became law first). But Falkenbury did point to an incident in Seattle, which does have transgender-friendly bathroom rules, in which a man walked into a women’s locker room at a pool. People complained, and he was kicked out of the locker room by pool staff despite claiming he had the right to be there. But that example actually goes against Forest’s point, since the man was removed. And the Washington Human Rights Commission, a part of the state government, reaffirmed the decision to kick him out. "If a business has a reasonable belief that a person is in the wrong place, there is no rule that states that the person cannot be questioned and required to leave," the commission said. The man in that situation was never charged with any crimes, but neither we nor Forest can say what might happen in a similar case in North Carolina. There’s simply no precedent here. But Forest’s more worrisome scenario, in which a man undresses or showers with women consequence-free, is clearly implausible. Even in a hypothetical North Carolina city with a transgender-friendly bathroom rule, that would absolutely be illegal. The state law against indecent exposure gives only one exception: If the nudity occurs someplace where it's incidental (like a locker room) and it happens in front of only people of the same sex. Since local ordinances can’t override state law, no city’s bathroom rules could change that fact. The law only cares about anatomy, not gender identity. Our ruling Lt. Gov. Dan Forest said that Cooper’s HB2 repeal bill, if it passes, "will create a state-sanctioned 'Look But Don't Touch' policy in our bathrooms" with no laws in place to protect women from predatory men. In reality, there are at least half a dozen laws protecting people from the type of scenarios Forest wrongly said would become consequence-free. Cooper even suggested creating stronger penalties for some of them. Forest defended his claim by saying cities would start letting transgender people in bathrooms of the gender with which they identify. That's not what Cooper proposed, however. And even if it does happen, it’s a local government decision, not a "state-sanctioned" policy. And even in that case, one of Forest’s hypothetical concerns is clearly baseless, and the other is unclear at best.

pomt-12190	There were 2,761 auto thefts in 2006 under Rick Baker and 1,095 auto thefts in 2016.	mostly true	/florida/statements/2017/jul/27/rick-kriseman/taking-closer-look-auto-theft-problem-st-petersbur/	Whose epidemic is it anyway? The leading candidates in St. Petersburg’s mayoral race are trading blows over the city’s issue with automobile theft ahead of the Aug. 29 primary. Former Mayor Rick Baker told a Tampa Bay Times reporter that auto theft is "now at epidemic proportions" under Mayor Rick Kriseman. Kriseman defended himself on Twitter and Facebook with a graphic showing the problem appeared worse during Baker’s time in office. According to Kriseman’s post, there were 2,761 auto thefts in 2006 under Baker, compared with 1,095 auto thefts in 2016 under Kriseman. With our colleagues at the Tampa Bay Times investigating the juvenile car-theft problem, we wanted to look at the trend under both mayors. The numbers Kriseman reported from the St. Petersburg Police Department checked out for those years. See Figure 2 on PolitiFact.com Baker was mayor from April 2001 to January 2010. Kriseman’s campaign plucked the worst year to make its counterpunch. The year 2006 was the highest point for auto thefts since 2000 — although most other years were higher than any point in Kriseman’s three full years since taking office in 2014. Choosing to compare raw numbers from Baker's 2008 and Kriseman's 2015, though, could leave a different impression, with 1,461 and 1,523 thefts, respectively. What does the bigger story tell you? The rate of car thefts in St. Petersburg remains far higher than the national and state average, shown below, regardless of who was mayor. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com "The number of auto-thefts, the number of auto burglaries, it’s something you need to watch and something that’s important, but the impact of the activity is more important than anything else," Pinellas County Sheriff Bob Gualtieri said. And in recent years, the impact of automobile thefts, specifically juvenile auto thefts, has been a priority for the department. The Tampa Bay Times documented the automobile theft issue, finding that children in Pinellas County were arrested more for stealing cars than anywhere else in Florida. Gualtieri said 2015 was "ground zero" for the juvenile auto-theft problem and said that’s when the department really started noticing the trend of young kids stealing cars. In early 2016, three teenage girls drove a stolen car into a cemetery pond and drowned. At the time, Gualtieri called the incident "unacceptable." "Solutions need to come deep from within the community," Gualtieri said at the time. "Kids need to know there are consequences. This is a systematic and complex problem." Automobile thefts became a priority for police in 2015 and 2016 — leading to a year-over-year drop. Law enforcement officials consider juvenile auto thefts a countywide problem; a drop in St. Petersburg doesn’t necessarily mean the problem is over. Detective Paul Etcheson, who’s been with the police department for almost nine years and works in the property crime unit, described automobile theft in St. Petersburg as a "revolving door." "The reason the numbers have fallen in the previous months is because we have juveniles placed in programs, or on 21-day hold or something," he said. "As soon as they get back, they’re right back at it." As we said, 2006 was a high point for auto theft. We wanted to understand why. Police officer Mark Williams, who has been with the deparment for over a decade, said cars were simply easier to steal in 2005 and 2006 like the Dodge Ram 1500. Older cars could be broken into with a screwdriver or a pair of scissors, he said. Williams said automakers have done a better job of eliminating access points on cars. For instance, key holes are only on the driver side rather than on all doors. In response to Kriseman’s image, Baker said, "I’ve been to 50 neighborhood organizations in the last six months and if Rick Kriseman thinks he doesn’t have an auto theft problem, he needs to get out more." Kriseman’s campaign emphasized the mayor is still concerned about automobile thefts, and said the image was meant to undermine Baker’s remark that automobile theft is at "epidemic proportions." Our ruling Kriseman pushed back against Baker calling the auto-theft problem an "epidemic" with a graphic that said there were 2,761 auto thefts in 2006 under Baker and 1,095 auto thefts in 2016. Those numbers are accurate, but more information is needed to understand the full story. Kriseman cherry-picked the year of Baker’s two terms with the highest amount of theft and compared it with his lowest year. To his overall point, the automobile theft per capita in St. Petersburg has been significantly higher than the national and state rates, regardless of who was in office.

pomt-12676	Says Republican legislators in North Carolina raised the average teacher's pay "by more than 15 percent in just three years."	mostly false	/north-carolina/statements/2017/mar/16/phil-berger/north-carolina-teacher-pay-has-been-rising-not-nea/	Responding to Democratic Gov. Roy Cooper’s "State of the State" speech Monday night, one of North Carolina’s top Republican leaders said his party has given the average teacher a substantial raise in recent years. Part of Cooper’s speech highlighted his proposal to give every teacher an extra $150 to buy textbooks for his or her classroom, since he said that their "paychecks (are) stretched too thin already." Republican Sen. Phil Berger, the president pro tem of the senate, gave the official response to Cooper’s speech. On the matter of education, Berger said he and his fellow Republicans deserve credit for giving teachers large raises. Berger told viewers to imagine a political party that had promised to "raise average teacher pay by more than 15 percent in just three years." He spoke about a few more issues, then concluded: "That is exactly what House and Senate Republicans have accomplished in our state." Actually, they did not. What he gets wrong In total, since the GOP took over control of the N.C. General Assembly in 2011, the average teacher’s pay has not risen 15 percent. It has risen about half that much. And that’s in the span of six years, not three. So Berger’s claim citing a three-year period ignores half the budgets passed by Republican lawmakers. But still, we asked which three years Berger was talking about. His office told us it’s the period from the 2014-15 school year until now. For reference, below is the average teacher pay in North Carolina for the last decade. Every budget starting in 2011-12 has been written and passed by Republican legislators. 2007-08: $47,354 2008-09: $48,648 2009-10: $46,850 2010-11: $46,605 2011-12: $45,933 2012-13: $45,737 2013-14: $44,990 2014-15: $47,819 2015-16: $47,985 2016-17: $49,837 Teacher pay began falling in 2009-10, under Democratic leadership. It continued falling in the next four budgets, three of which were written and passed by Republican legislators. Berger didn’t want to talk about those three budgets, just the most recent three. Nevertheless, his claim is still wrong. As the data shows, the raises in each of the last three years have taken the average teacher's salary from just under $45,000 a year to just under $50,000. One of those years, as we found in a previous fact check of Republican House Speaker Tim Moore, was the nation's biggest. But it still wasn't enough to make Berger's claim accurate. There has been a 10.8 percent raise, not a 15 percent raise. So how does he explain the difference between his claim and reality? Any proof? Berger’s office pointed us to a document from the state legislature that tracks pay changes for teachers and state employees each year since the 1970s. Amy Auth, Berger’s deputy chief of staff, said it backs up his claim. At first glance, it does appear to show that the raises since 2014-2015 add up to 15.5 percent. But there are several caveats to that number. Part of that was a bonus teachers received last year, which didn’t change their base pay and wasn’t repeated again this year. In other words, it wasn’t actually a raise. Also, in 2014 the state got rid of annual longevity bonuses for veteran teachers. At the same time, those teachers’ base salaries went up. For that reason the state counted the change as a raise – yet the loss of longevity pay gave the raise an inflated value, and some veteran teachers actually would’ve made more money if the change hadn’t happened, The News & Observer reported at the time. But even if you take the full 15.5 percent statistic at face value, it still only counts the state’s portion of teachers’ salaries – which is only about two-thirds of the total. The rest comes from supplements paid by 108 of the state’s 115 local school districts. So while some of the blame or credit for teacher pay will always rest outside the responsibility of legislative leaders like Berger, that doesn’t change the fact that his claim isn’t true. Furthermore, Berger in the past has frequently touted estimates that the state raised teacher pay to $50,000 this year. That would require counting the local supplements. His claim Monday also would have to include those local supplements, since he talked about the average salary. Yet his evidence ignored that, instead focusing only on the state’s base salaries. Our ruling Berger said Republicans in North Carolina promised to raise teacher pay "by more than 15 percent in just three years," and "that is exactly what House and Senate Republicans have accomplished in our state." The average teacher's salary in the last three years has risen 10.8 percent. And over the entire time Republicans have been in charge of the state budget, the total raise has been even smaller than that, since teacher pay fell during the first three years of GOP control. Berger’s office pointed to numbers for just the state’s portion of teachers’ salaries. But there are some issues with the accounting there, and that’s also not what Berger actually talking about. Pay has been rising for North Carolina teachers recently, but not by nearly as much as Berger claims. We rate this claim Mostly False. Correction: Teachers have received a 10.8 percent raise over the last three years, not over the last four years as a previous version of this article said. There also has been a 4.2 percent increase in the last two years. This does not change our ruling.	None	Phil Berger	None	None	None	2017-03-16T18:59:15	2017-03-13	['North_Carolina']
pomt-11733	A Colgate toothpaste is subject to "recall."	false	/punditfact/statements/2017/dec/12/shared/story-misleads-about-fd-triclosan-and-toothpaste/	A headline warns consumers about triclosan, an ingredient in some consumer products: "If you are using this toothpaste .... throw it away immediately!" Facebook users flagged the Nov. 28 story on Shared This as being potentially fabricated, as part of the social network’s efforts to combat fake news. The article could leave readers with an inaccurate picture about actions the U.S. Food and Drug Administration took with respect to triclosan, but it also contains some factual information. Shared This wrote that the FDA issued a warning "this week" that it will ban triclosan, a common antibacterial agent used in soaps, detergents, toys, cosmetics, and toothpaste. "Apparently, the chemical poses a high-degree of health risks and side effects. Colgate Total is just one of many products that list triclosan as an active ingredient," wrote Shared This. The website included an image of the word "recall" and a photo of Colgate toothpaste showing that it contains triclosan. That could give readers the false impression that the FDA banned triclosan in toothpaste -- and that’s not the case. Here’s what actually happened: Natural Resources Defense Council filed a lawsuit in an effort to force the FDA to take action related to triclosan. In September 2016 the FDA issued a new rule banning the use of triclosan in antibacterial soaps. "That rule was specific to consumer hand washes," Sandy Walsh, a spokeswoman for the F.D.A. told PolitiFact. That means the ban doesn’t apply to toothpaste. Colgate Total Toothpaste was approved in 1997 as a toothpaste containing fluoride and triclosan, which was shown to be effective in reducing plaque and gingivitis. "Based on the scientific evidence, the balance of benefit and risk has been shown to be favorable for this product," Walsh said. The New York Times reported in September 2016 that triclosan remained in toothpaste because Colgate Total convinced the FDA that the benefit of triclosan outweighed the risks. Colgate Total is the only toothpaste in the United States that contains triclosan. A spokesman for Colgate-Palmolive, Thomas DiPiazza, told the New York Times that Colgate’s product had a far more rigorous safety review than other toothpastes. When the company sought approval to use triclosan in 1997, it conducted a comprehensive evaluation of human safety. The original FDA submission for Colgate Total included more than 100 toxicology studies. DiPiazza directed PolitiFact to a statement on Colgate’s website which cited a 2013 review of 30 studies by Cochrane Oral Health Group. The review concluded that there were benefits including reduction in plaque, gingivitis and bleeding gums in using a triclosan/copolymer fluoride toothpaste when compared with one without the ingredient. "There was no evidence of any harmful effects associated with the use of triclosan/copolymer toothpastes in studies up to three years in length," Cochrane reported. But a debate about triclosan has continued. Several months after the FDA’s September 2016 rule was published, an article by 200 scientists and medical professionals published by Environmental Health Perspectives raised multiple concerns about triclosan. The authors concluded that the ingredient has detrimental effects on aquatic organisms, overuse may contribute to antibiotic/antimicrobial resistance, and that potential implications for human reproduction and development merit further study. The authors recommended that people avoid the use of triclosan except if there is an "evidence based health benefit (e.g., physician-prescribed toothpaste for treating gum disease) and there is adequate evidence demonstrating they are safe." Colgate-Palmolive and the FDA however continue to stand by the use of triclosan in Colgate Total toothpaste. "It has been approved as safe and effective through the U.S. FDA rigorous New Drug Application process," DiPiazza said. Shared This is a website that posts articles about health, beauty, news and other topics. We sent a message to the website on Facebook and did not get a reply. Our ruling Shared This stated that the FDA issued a ban on triclosan, which is an ingredient in soap, toothpaste and other products. The article included photos of Colgate toothpaste and uses an image of the word "recall." In reality the FDA’s ban in September 2016 only applied to antibacterial soaps and not Colgate Total toothpaste. We rate this statement False.

pomt-12946	"Asia ... has less freshwater per capita than any other continent, except Antarctica."	mostly true	/global-news/statements/2017/jan/06/brahma-chellaney/yes-asia-most-water-strapped-continent/	Americans are up to their eyebrows in water, relatively speaking. Other parts of the world aren’t as fortunate. A prominent Indian analyst, Brahma Chellaney, has been sounding the alarm for many years about the tightening competition for water in Asia. "Averting water-related conflicts is actually a major challenge across Asia, which has less freshwater per capita than any other continent, except Antarctica," Chellaney wrote in a Dec. 28 op-ed. "This reality has helped promote growing interstate and intrastate disputes over shared water resources." We wanted to verify that, indeed, the average Asian has less water at hand than the residents of other continents. Aquastat, a project of the United Nations’ Food and Agriculture Organization, is the go-to source for information on how much water is potentially available for human use. In Aquastat’s 2016 summary, Asia had about 2,000 gallons per day available for each person. The project website states, "Asia is the continent with the lowest volume of renewable freshwater resources per person." The Asian average compares to 14,700 gallons per person per day in North America, 22,900 gallons per person per day in South America, and 5,400 gallons per person per day in Australia. Aquastat, unfortunately, has no summary data for Europe or Africa. We used another UN data source for a back-of-the-envelope calculation. It supports Chellaney’s essential point about relative scarcity in Asia. A 2008 report from the United Nations Environment Program provides estimates of the freshwater that exists on each continent. (It too has gaps. It has no estimate for surface water in South America and estimating groundwater in Australia is tricky because much of that water is infused with salt.) We divided the totals by population estimates based on Population Reference Bureau data. Asia still comes in last, at least among continents that have year-round residents. But contrary to Chellaney’s assertion, Antarctica is flooded with freshwater. The problem is, it’s all frozen. The UN Environment Program said Antarctica had over 30 million cubic kilometers of freshwater locked up in its glaciers and ice. And aside from about 1,000 researchers who spend time there, it has no people. So technically, Antarctica has more freshwater per capita than anywhere. Practically speaking though, comparing continental water supplies is always a bit misleading because the water that’s actually available varies hugely from place to place within each continent, and often within each country. Southern China has plenty of water, while the north is dry. For India, the northwest is much drier than the eastern sections of the country. Plus, as the staff at Aquastat note, estimates of total water supply don’t mean that the water is "fully exploitable and available." Some is in remote locations, the amount can swing widely between wet and dry seasons, some might need to be reserved to sustain the environment, and often, technical challenges put the water out of reach of pumping stations and other infrastructure. Asia’s looming water problems have drawn increasing attention in recent years. A 2016 projection from researchers at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology concluded that "there is a high risk of severe water stress in densely populated watersheds by 2050." The MIT group compared a number of scenarios and determined that most of the pressure stemmed from a growing population and increasing demands from a rising economy, rather than climate change. By 2050, they estimated about 1 billion people could be pressed to meet their daily water needs. "Without assertive water policies in these regions, water limitations could be harmful to the health and well being of the people in these regions, as well as the environment," they wrote. Our ruling Chellaney said that Asia has less freshwater per capita than any other continent, except Antarctica. Technically, he’s wrong about Antarctica, which has plenty of freshwater in its glaciers, but practically speaking, he’s correct. The UN’s primary project on water statistics reports that Asia has the lowest amount of freshwater resources per person. We used an alternative data set and while the numbers differed, Asia still ranked last among places where people actually live. We rate this claim Mostly True. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/35f9e7a4-9ead-4d2e-9d8e-6da1c0bd139a	None	Brahma Chellaney	None	None	None	2017-01-06T13:00:00	2016-12-28	['Asia', 'Antarctica']
pomt-08211	Says Oregon ranks 30th in the nation with regard to its incarceration rate.	true	/oregon/statements/2010/nov/19/crime-victims-united-oregon/anti-crime-organization-says-oregon-ranks-30th-inc/	When Oregon legislators set out to evaluate the state’s budget in the coming months, they’ll take a keen look at the state’s prison system. For the 2007-09 budget period, public safety accounted for nearly 15 percent of what the state spends, and, by one measure, the state’s prison system takes nearly one dime out of every dollar in the general fund. Naturally, there’s a lot of talk about how the state can make that slice of the dollar smaller. That talk then turns to the subject of minimum sentences and how the measures that Oregonians have approved over the years might be contributing to the large cost. (Most recently, voters said "yes" to Measure 73, which mandated longer sentences for repeat drunken drivers and sex offenders.) Pushing back on this line of reasoning, Oregon Crime Victims United offered a little context in a piece online that then got picked up by another tough-on-crime group called the Oregon Anti-Crime Alliance. In the statement, Crime Victims United argues that the cost of corrections is sometimes used as proof that Oregon has gone too far on incarceration. "However," the statement says, "costs have risen far faster than incarceration. Oregon still ranks just 30th in incarceration rate. We have not gone overboard with incarceration." There’s a lot there to consider, but what jumped out at us was the statement that Oregon ranks "just 30th in incarceration rate." We decided to check the number out. We spoke with Howard Rodstein, the group’s number cruncher. He e-mailed us a link to a Bureau of Justice Statistics report that compares all 50 states’ incarceration rates. According to this report, "imprisonment rate is the number of prisoners sentenced to more than 1 year per 100,000 U.S. residents." Under that definition, Oregon scored 371 for 2008 and did, in fact, come in at 30th place. As a comparison, the national number was 504 prisoners per 100,000 residents.. We went to the source of that report, and asked spokeswoman Kara McCarthy whether the Bureau of Justice Statistics had any newer numbers. She said it did not. To make sure we did our due diligence, we checked in with Tony Green, spokesman for the Oregon attorney general. Green said he didn’t have any other numbers to provide, but pointed us to the state Department of Corrections. We dialed them up, too. There, spokeswoman Jeanine Hohn was able to provide fresh numbers. She sent us another report by the Bureau of Justice Statistics that showed Oregon with an incarceration rate of 375 midway through 2009. That put Oregon in 28th place. That indicates some slight movement upward. Hohn also got Michael Wilson, an economist with the Criminal Justice Commission, on the phone with us. Wilson said that the Bureau of Justice Statistics reports are pretty much the standard measurement. "For the most part, it's what people use because it's the best that's out there," he said. Oregon’s incarceration rate did increase faster than the national rate from the early ‘90s through 2005 or so, he said, but -- with help from population growth -- has leveled off since then, keeping our rate below the national average. Before we get to the ruling, we want to point out one final piece of context: While Oregon ranks near the middle when it comes to U.S. incarceration rates, the United States happens to be a world leader in this area. According to the International Centre for Prison Studies at King’s College London, the United States’ incarceration rate far outpaces most other countries’. Now, back to the issue at hand. Oregon Crime Victims United said that Oregon ranked 30th in state incarceration rates. Newer numbers show that to be off, but only slightly. Because not even the spokeswoman for the Bureau of Justice Statistics knew about the fresher numbers, we won’t fault Crime Victims United for the slight discrepancy. We find this claim to be True.

pomt-00408	"A few months ago, it hit where West Virginia is, on a per capita basis, one of the most successful (gross domestic product) states in our union."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2018/aug/31/donald-trump/donald-trump-mostly-incorrect-about-wva-economic-g/	Like many politicians, President Donald Trump often refers to economic growth to gauge the success of his policies. And one of the most common yardsticks politicians use is gross domestic product, which is the sum of all economic activity in a geographical unit, such as a country or a state. At a rally in Charleston, W.Va., on Aug. 21, Trump said, "When I came here originally, West Virginia, frankly, was down and out. It was not doing exactly well. One of the last. Do you know that a few months ago, it hit where West Virginia is, on a per capita basis, one of the most successful G.D.P. states in our union?" Does he have a point? We took a closer look. Looking at quarterly GDP growth This isn’t the first time Trump has claimed success in revitalizing West Virginia's economy. A little over a year ago, he said at a different rally in the state, "3 percent growth in West Virginia. … West Virginia, you’re leading the average." At the time, PolitiFact found that assertion to be well-grounded. During the first quarter of 2017, West Virginia’s economy grew by exactly 3 percent, according to the data available at the time. (This figure was subsequently updated with new data, as is the standard procedure.) That was the second-fastest rate of any state in the country at the time. It was well above the national average for the first quarter, which was 1.2 percent. However, as we noted at the time, that was only one quarter’s worth of growth. How well has The Mountain State done since then? It’s been a bit of a roller coaster, according to data from the federal Bureau of Economic Analysis. Here are the figures for annualized GDP growth for West Virginia on Trump’s watch. They are the most recent figures available, including updated data for the previous quarters. Quarter Annualized GDP growth for West Virginia 1st quarter 2017 6.6 percent 2nd quarter 2017 -1.1 percent 3rd quarter 2017 10.2 percent 4th quarter 2017 1.0 percent 1st quarter 2018 1.3 percent This chart shows that while West Virginia has had some highs in GDP growth during Trump’s tenure -- specifically, in the first and third quarters of 2017 -- the state’s GDP actually shrank during the second quarter of 2017, and in the most recent two quarters, it has grown only modestly, by 1 percent and 1.3 percent, respectively. In fact, during the most recent quarter for which data is available, West Virginia’s growth rate ranked as only the 37th best in the nation. That paints a different picture than the one Trump was offering at the rally. Looking at GDP per capita There’s another way to look at Trump’s assertion -- to compare gross domestic product per capita for West Virginia to the other states in the union. This statistic is calculated by dividing the state’s GDP by the state’s population. Measuring it this way makes Trump’s statement even less accurate. For 2017 -- the most recent full year for which data is available -- West Virginia ranked 47th nationally in GDP per capita, according to the Bureau of Economic Analysis. The only states that ranked lower were Arkansas, Idaho and Mississippi. Finally, we’ll note that economists say presidents don’t deserve either full credit or full blame for employment trends on their watch. The president is not all-powerful on economic matters; broader factors, from the business cycle to changes in technology to demographic shifts, play major roles. Our ruling Trump said, "A few months ago, it hit where West Virginia is, on a per capita basis, one of the most successful (gross domestic product) states in our union." Judging by quarterly GDP growth -- a measure Trump has used accurately in the past to talk about West Virginia -- the state chalked up two quarters of rapid growth but three quarters of stagnation. In the most recent two quarters, West Virginia was mired around 1 percent growth, ranking in the bottom half of states. Alternately, using GDP per capita, Trump is way off, as West Virginia ranks 47th among the states in this measure. The statement contains an element of truth but ignores evidence that would give a different impression, so we rate the statement Mostly False.

pomt-06960	Says recent polls show Americans agree with Republicans that the federal debt ceiling should not be raised and the debt and deficit should be dealt with mostly by cutting spending.	mostly true	/texas/statements/2011/jul/16/josh-trevino/josh-trevino-says-polls-show-americans-aligned-rep/	Josh Treviño, spokesman for the conservative Austin-based Texas Public Policy Foundation, suggested in an MSNBC appearance that Americans are aligned with Republicans in Washington in opposing an increase in the federal debt ceiling and wanting to attack the federal deficit with budget cuts. Treviño, referring to polling by the Gallup organization, told interviewer Al Sharpton July 13 that "it’s pretty clear that the American people, or at least a plurality of them, are on (Senate Minority Leader Mitch) McConnell’s side and on the House GOP’s side as well. "Yesterday," Treviño said, "we saw Gallup release a poll that had 42 percent of Americans, a plurality, opposed to raising the debt ceiling. And today we had a Gallup poll showing 50 percent versus 11 (percent) on the other side thinking that the debt and the deficit should be dealt with by mostly spending cuts. So the Republicans are on the side of the American people here, and I think that’s pretty clear." A reader asked if Treviño accurately replayed the poll results. As we looked for the relevant results, Gallup spokeswoman Lydia Saad told us there’s only one poll at issue. In the telephone poll of 1,016 adults taken July 7-10, 42 percent of respondents said they wanted their House member to vote against raising the debt ceiling, while 22 percent said they preferred a favorable vote; 33 percent were unsure. The poll had a margin of error of plus or minus 4 percentage points. Gallup said respondents who identified themselves as Republicans were more unified in opposition to raising the debt ceiling (60 percent opposed, 11 percent in favor) than Democrats were supportive of raising it (39 percent in favor, 21 percent opposed). Independents tilted against raising the ceiling, 46 percent to 18 percent, with 36 percent having no opinion. "Despite intense lobbying of Congress by President Obama, Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner and others in the administration about the economic urgency for raising the nation's debt limit," the poll results’ summary says, "fewer than one in four Americans favor the general idea of raising it." Treviño’s other point — that Americans favor mostly budget cuts to deal with the deficit — didn’t poll as neatly as his recap suggests. Asked how they’d prefer members of Congress to address the deficit, 20 percent said only by cutting spending and another 30 percent said mostly with spending cuts. Four percent favored solely tax increases, while 7 percent said they’d prefer to tackle the deficit mostly by tax hikes. Still, 32 percent said they’d support a mix of spending cuts and tax increases. Put another way, at least 43 percent indicated some support for tax increases — most of them also backing budget cuts. "Americans' preferences for deficit reduction clearly favor spending cuts to tax increases," Gallup sums up, "but most Americans favor a mix of the two approaches." Its write-up closes: "A key question to be answered in the days ahead is whether an agreement to raise the debt ceiling will include any tax increases. This is something many Republican members of Congress oppose, but most Americans do not seem to share this view." We rate Treviño’s statement Mostly True.

pomt-10522	"We've won twice as many states. We've won a greater share of the popular vote."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/mar/10/barack-obama/a-slight-lead-in-popular-vote/	After losing the Texas and Ohio primaries March 4, 2008, Sen. Barack Obama tried to downplay the losses by emphasizing that he leads Sen. Hillary Clinton in delegates and the popular vote. "The bottom line is, we've won twice as many states. We've won a greater share of the popular vote," he said. The first part is easy to assess. At the point when he made this comment, Obama had won primaries or caucuses in 25 states (including the District of Columbia), while Clinton had won 14 states (not counting Florida and Michigan). Obama's math is off, but he's in the ballpark. Still, he would have been more accurate if he said he had won nearly twice as many states. The second part is a little trickier because some states that held caucuses — Iowa, Nevada, Washington and Maine — have not released popular vote totals. They've only released the percentage of the vote and the number of delegates won. Also, the election results from Florida and Michigan are in limbo because the Democratic National Committee has not recognized the results from those states because they defied the DNC schedule. It's further complicated by the fact that Obama was not on the ballot in Michigan. Adding up vote totals from the other contests, PolitiFact finds Obama to be ahead (as of March 7, 2008) by 13,002,527 to 12,413,052 if Michigan and Florida are not counted. He's also ahead by 13,578,741 to 13,284,038 if Florida is included but Michigan is not. The only scenario in which Clinton is ahead is if Michigan is also included. She has 13,612,347 to Obama's 13,578,741. We have to give thanks to RealClearPolitics.com, which tracks popular vote totals and provides links to results on state Web sites. We went to those individual sites and tallied the numbers on a spreadsheet. Keep in mind, some states are still adding up votes and these numbers will change. Also, we completed these calculations before the March 8, 2008, Wyoming caucus, so those results are not included. Back to Obama's claim: We find he has it mostly right. On the first part, he'd be better off hedging his claim on winning twice as many states as Clinton. But on the matter of popular vote, Obama is accurate. Though, to be fail-safe, he should have specified that he was excluding Michigan. Overall, we find his claim to be Mostly True.

pomt-10448	"His true name is Barak Hussein Muhammed Obama."	pants on fire!	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/may/02/chain-email/no-muhammed-or-mohammed-in-obamas-name/	A chain e-mail that originates with a letter from American missionaries working in Kenya warns about Sen. Barack Obama's ties to Kenya and its opposition party, encouraging readers "not to be taken in by those that are promoting him." Among the many allegations is one about Obama's name: "By the way. His true name is Barak Hussein Muhammed Obama. Won't that sound sweet to our enemies as they swear him in on the Koran! God bless you." The e-mail reads like a bad game of "telephone," its claims drawn from assorted people and sources that have been stitched together. And yet, because it is signed by real people, who have a life in Africa, it somehow carries more credence than your average blog posting — and it's spreading rapidly. ( Read the e-mail here. ) Let's be clear: The senator from Illinois who is running for president of the United States is named Barack Hussein Obama Jr. His campaign has insisted that is his full name (no Muhammad). We've checked this before and found it to be blatantly wrong. But since the rumor persists, we decided to dig deeper. We have now searched every public record we can access and find nothing to support the notion that Obama has a second middle name of "Muhammed" or "Mohammed." Only in the ether of chain e-mails does this allegation fly. We have a copy of Obama's marriage certificate from the Cook County Bureau of Vital Statistics in Illinois. Barack H. Obama married Michelle L. Robinson on Oct. 3, 1992, in Chicago. (And, yes, the Rev. Jeremiah A. Wright Jr. officiated.) We looked at Obama's driver's license record in the state of Illinois, and the name reads: Barack H Obama. (Senator, just a reminder that your license is up for renewal this year). We searched property records for Obama and found listings under the names Barack Hussein Obama and Barack H Obama. We also found Obama's registration and disciplinary record with the Attorney Registration & Disciplinary Commission of the Supreme Court of Illinois. ( You can see it here. ) Barack Hussein Obama was admitted as a lawyer by the Illinois Supreme Court on Dec. 17, 1991. (By the way, Obama has no public record of discipline.) We tried to obtain a copy of Obama's birth certificate, but his campaign would not release it and the state of Hawaii does not make such records public. (UPDATE: On June 12, 2008, the Obama campaign e-mailed to PolitiFact a copy of the senator's birth certificate. It confirms our findings. See it for yourself here.) Loren Davis, whose wife Celeste wrote the e-mail, says he can't substantiate the claim. "That was what we heard there (in Kenya)," Davis said in an interview with PolitiFact. He says they've lived and worked in Kenya for the past 12 years and this was a personal letter "never intended to be forwarded or sent out to the Web." Regardless, it's time to ground this charge once and for all. His name is Barack Hussein Obama. There is simply no evidence anywhere to support the allegation that his name is something else. We're going to rule the way we have before. Pants on Fire!	None	Chain email	None	None	None	2008-05-02T00:00:00	2008-04-18	['None']
pomt-13519	"And while (Ted) Strickland proposed cuts for services for children, he wasted over $250,000 remodeling his bathrooms at the governor’s mansion."	pants on fire!	/ohio/statements/2016/sep/01/national-republican-senatorial-committee/pro-republican-pac-smears-ted-strickland-potty-pol/	It must be some kind of election-year hazing ritual: the first ad that dunks an opposing candidate in the toilet. The National Republican Senatorial Committee’s ad, "Flush," targets Democratic Senate candidate Ted Strickland in Ohio. In it, they attack Strickland’s fiscal management during his term as Ohio’s governor against a background of a flushing commode. "And while Strickland proposed cuts for services for children," the voice-over claims, "he wasted over $250,000 remodeling his bathrooms at the governor’s mansion." Did he or didn’t he? We’ll start with the first claim. Cuts for children Multiple calls to the National Republican Senatorial Committee went unreturned, so we are left to assume that the reference to Strickland cutting funds for children’s services is about his proposed budget in 2009. As governor from 2007 until 2011, the worst years of the national economic downturn, Strickland was faced with a $3.2 billion budget hole. The Columbus Dispatch reported that Strickland’s 2009 budget proposal "would cut out state aid to food pantries, slash funding to community health centers, abolish the state preschool program for poor youngsters and reduce eligibility for state-subsidized child care." The planned cuts were met with instant backlash, the Dispatch reported. In its final form, the budget resulted in less funding for services for low-income families, the disabled, Medicaid recipients and public libraries. But thanks to federal stimulus money, funding for education actually increased. It also allocated state funds for schools to provide all-day kindergarten. $250,000 bathroom remodel The "Flush" ad states that Strickland wasted a quarter of a million dollars remodeling his bathrooms at the governor’s mansion in suburban Bexley, Ohio, outside Columbus. But as it turns out, those toilets weren’t for Strickland or his family at all. They were built in the carriage house that borders the Heritage Garden on the property, apart from the main residence. According to an Associated Press story in the Logan Daily News, the new public toilets were constructed to serve the busloads of tourists who come to see the mansion -- an estimated 20,000 visitors a year. "They are funded by private donations and $263,000 in taxpayer money," the paper reported. The expenditure wasn’t initiated by Strickland, but was set aside in 2006 under the administration of Strickland’s predecessor, Gov. Bob Taft. Taft’s capital budget allocated $912,000 for "Governor’s Residence Renovations" which included "additional slate roof renovations, window well drain repairs, concrete porch replacement, and driveway and parking area surface replacement." PolitiFact Ohio contacted James Miller, the former state of Ohio project manager who oversaw the governor’s residence, its staff, and all capital improvement projects, including the bathroom renovation in the carriage house. (Miller, retired after 30 years of managing government properties, now charters fishing tours on Lake Erie.) Miller said that before the five unisex bathrooms were constructed, tourists had to go into the main house and wait in line to use the restroom, often after long bus trips. The construction of the bathrooms included "green" features like solar panels and geothermal piping, and were built to comply with the Americans with Disabilities Act for handicapped access, Miller said. More than half of the price tag for the restroom renovation -- $171,840 -- came from funding through the Americans with Disabilities Act. The other $95,695.70 was from the fund Taft established for governor’s residence improvements. Miller laughed at the picture the "Flush" ad paints of Strickland frittering away money on luxuries because he knew him as a "real frugal man" who got rid of the chef who worked at the governor's mansion. Strickland did change one part of the master bathroom in the governor’s residence, Miller said. He painted it. "He did it himself," Miller said, "believe me." Our ruling An ad by the National Republican Senatorial Committee says that while governor, Strickland "proposed cuts for services for children" and "wasted over $250,000 remodeling his bathrooms at the governor’s mansion." Strickland did propose budget cuts in the midst of the national economic downturn, many of which affected services for low-income families. But the ad suggests that the money used to renovate the restrooms at the governor’s residence could have been used to fund those services. In reality, the funding sources -- the Americans with Disabilities Act, and residence-specific dollars reserved by Strickland’s predecessor -- would not have been available for shoring up programs affected by budget cuts. The ad calls the bathrooms "his," as in Strickland’s. But they weren’t -- they were for public visitors of the governor’s residence and surrounding property. The ad flushes the facts, so we rate it Pants on Fire! https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/db8e211a-122c-49d7-a5ad-4d0ead6b78e4	None	National Republican Senatorial Committee	None	None	None	2016-09-01T16:53:03	2016-08-18	['None']
pomt-09493	The Democratic health care plan is a "government takeover of our health programs."	pants on fire!	/florida/statements/2010/feb/24/cw-bill-young/bill-young-claims-house-plan-was-government-takeov/	Many Republicans have said the Democratic health care plan is a "government takeover" of the nation's health system. The phrase has appeared in at least 700 newspaper articles in the past six months, according to a Nexis search. It's been a powerful weapon for the GOP opposition because it conjures images of a sluggish, state-run bureaucracy. So when 20-term U.S. Rep. C.W. Bill Young announced he was running for re-election in a speech to Pinellas County Republicans on Feb. 20, 2010, he mentioned his opposition to the health plan and other Democratic initiatives. "I voted against the bailout, and I'm going to do it again," the Indian Shores Republican said to applause. "I voted against the stimulus, and I'm going to do it again," he added. "I voted against the government takeover of our health programs, and I'm going to do it again." We should note that he was referring to the original Democratic health plan that passed the U.S. House last fall, not the one the White House unveiled on Feb. 22. But we suspect it wouldn't make much difference. The problem is, it's wrong. By any reasonable definition, there's no way that the Democratic plan could be considered a government takeover. Indeed, its primary approach is to set up new systems to encourage private health insurance companies to provide more coverage and better services. The cornerstone of the Democratic program is actually the status quo. The majority of Americans would continue to get health coverage the way they do now -- from private insurance companies. That coverage would be paid for the same way it is now -- by private employers and individual premiums. That's not a government takeover. The biggest new element in the Democratic plan is a health care exchange that is supposed to provide coverage for Americans who have trouble getting it now -- people who are self-employed or work for small companies. The government (or the states) would create the exchanges, which would be virtual marketplaces where people could shop for the best coverage. It's envisioned that most providers in the exchange would be private insurers, but the version of the bill that passed the House includes a "public option," a government-run program. That's been the most controversial element of the Democratic proposal. Some Republicans think it could be a stalking horse for a future expansion of the government's role. But still, the exchanges rely primarily on private insurers, so it's incorrect to call them a government takeover. (The new Obama plan appears to abandon the idea of a public option.) The other element of the plan that would increase government's role in providing coverage is the expansion of Medicaid. Under the House bill, Medicaid would be expanded to cover anyone at or below 150 percent of poverty level. According to one estimate by the Congressional Budget Office, that would add 11 million people to Medicaid (on top of the roughly 60 million now in it), which would account for about an 18 percent increase. Harry Glenn, a spokesman for Young, said Young was stating an opinion. But given the congressman's wording, we believe it was stated as fact. And once again, we are faced with over-the-top rhetoric about the health care plan. It's perfectly legitimate to raise questions about the plan and the government's role, but it's wildly incorrect to label it a government takeover. Yes, the plan would expand the government's role, but it primarily would continue to rely on private insurers for the vast majority of Americans. And, for people who have trouble getting coverage, it would create a marketplace so people could shop for coverage from private insurers. It's ridiculously false to call that a government takeover. For this one, we need to strike a match and set the meter ablaze. Pants on Fire!	None	C.W. Bill Young	None	None	None	2010-02-24T19:48:49	2010-02-20	['Democratic_Party_(United_States)']
pomt-00571	Georgia residents file the most insurance claims for lightning strikes in the country.	true	/georgia/statements/2015/jun/10/state-farm-insurance/georgia-leads-nation-lightning-claims/	Florida leads the nation in deaths from lightning strikes. But State Farm, one of the nation’s major insurers, says it is Georgia residents who file the most claims for lightning strikes in the country, WSB-TV reported Friday, June 5. PolitiFact Georgia was intrigued and decided to dig a little deeper. We began by contacting Justin Tomczak, a State Farm spokesman. He sent us data showing Georgia was No. 1 in 2014 for lightning-related claims both in number (3,709) and total dollar value ($16.3 million). Texas was second, Alabama at third, Louisiana at fourth and Illinois at fifth. STATE Reported Count Paid Indemnity Georgia 3,709 $16,301,952 Texas 2,201 $14,160,258 Alabama 1,902 $10,930,264 Louisiana 1,707 $10,930,264 Illinois 1,669 $8,030,507 . "This is the third year in a row that Georgia has been ranked No. 1," Tomczak said. Most of the lightning claims were surge- or power-related, the spokesman said. Damages generally resulted from power surges in electrical wiring, TV cable or phone lines in homes or businesses, he said. As to why Georgia has the most claims, Tomczak said, "there is no simple answer. However, many of the lightning claims are concentrated in the Southeastern United States, and Georgia has one of the highest populations in this area." John Jensenius, lightning safety specialist with the National Weather Service, said the population density in metro Atlanta may be a factor in Georgia’s high claim rate. The denser the population the more likely lightning will strike a house, Jensenius said. The Insurance Information Institute, in conjunction with State Farm, compiles a list each year of the top 10 states for homeowners insurance lightning losses by number of claims. In 2013, the institute listed Georgia as highest with 11,184 lightning-related insurance claims from homeowners. Its 2014 report is due out within days, a spokeswoman said. (Georgia was No. 1 for 2012 with 3,844 claims totalling $21.5 million and for 2013 with 2,969 claims totalling $14.9 million, according to State Farm). Nationwide, lightning strikes cost about $674 million in homeowners insurance losses in 2013, down 30.5 percent from 2012, according to the institute. From 2007 to 2011, local fire departments across the country responded to an average of 22,600 fires a year that were started by lightning, according to the National Fire Protection Association. These fires caused an average of $451 million in direct property damage and nine civilian deaths a year, an NFPA analysis shows. Lightning deaths Florida led the nation for lightning deaths in 2014 with six, followed by Wisconsin with three. Georgia, Arizona, Arkansas, Colorado and Massachusetts each had two deaths. Seven additional states -- California, Michigan, Missouri, Mississippi, New Mexico, Pennsylvania and Texas -- reported one lightning death in the year. The 26 lightning deaths in 2014 followed a record low of 23 set in 2013. The National Weather Service said deaths from lightning strikes averaged 33 a year from 2004 to 2013 and, going back over the last 30 years, an average of 51 people died each year after being hit by lightning. The significant decline in lightning deaths has been attributed to fewer farmers working in the fields, technological advances, improved safety standards and protection. As of the June 1, 2015 there have been six lightning fatalities, two in North Carolina and one each in Iowa, Florida, New Mexico and West Virginia, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). WSB-TV meteorologist Brian Monahan said lightning strikes occur most often in Georgia during the summer months when the high pressure area out in the Atlantic around Bermuda pumps in warm, humid air, creating those all-too-familiar afternoon and evening thunderstorms. A secondary spike of lightning strikes also occurs in the severe weather seasons of March to early May and around October and November, when the air is still warm and humid enough to support storms, Monahan said. Our ruling State Farm says Georgia residents file the most claims for lightning strikes in the country. There’s evidence this has been the case last year and the two previous years. We rate the statement as True.	None	State Farm Insurance	None	None	None	2015-06-10T00:00:00	2015-06-05	['None']
pomt-04855	Says Ron Saunders "made the choice to stand with Rick Scott" on expanding school vouchers, restricting scholarships and giving tax breaks to the wealthy.	false	/florida/statements/2012/aug/10/tomorrows-vision-florida/group-linked-state-rep-dwight-bullard-says-state-r/	Nothing says kiss of death in a Democratic primary like a candidate looking cozy with Republican Gov. Rick Scott. And that’s what a recent mailer attacking state Rep. Ron Saunders does in a competitive South Florida state Senate battle. The mailer shows a cartoon image of Saunders, the House’s Democratic minority leader from Key West, grinning and shaking hands with Scott as if they are best buds. "As a state representative, Ron Saunders made the choice to stand with Rick Scott. Now he’s asking you to send him back to Tallahassee as your state senator. When you see Ron Saunders, tell him that supporting Rick Scott was the wrong choice." The mailer also states that Saunders "has helped" Scott to: • "Take money from public schools by expanding vouchers" • "Make college less accessible by restricting Bright Futures scholarships" • "Give extra tax breaks to the wealthiest Floridians while so many families are struggling" Saunders is running in a crowded Democratic state Senate primary that includes state Rep. Dwight Bullard of Miami. Bullard comes from a political dynasty: His mother Larcenia Bullard is a state senator and his dad Edward is a former state legislator. The newly drawn District 39 spans Miami-Dade, Monroe, Collier and Hendry counties. The mailer was sent by Tomorrow’s Vision of Florida, an electioneering communication organization formed by Edward and Larcenia Bullard in July. We made multiple attempts to reach Dwight, Edward and Larcenia Bullard and did not hear back. For this article, we will check if Saunders voted as the mailer claims. And we will also explore whether those votes mean Saunders "made the choice to stand with Rick Scott." "Take money from public schools by expanding vouchers" The mailer cites two votes for this claim. • SB 2126: This 2010 bill made changes to Florida’s Tax Credit Scholarship program, which allows corporate donors to fund private-school scholarships for poor children in return for tax breaks. It passed the House 95-23 on April 8, 2010 -- months before Scott was elected governor. Saunders voted with the majority in favor, while Rep. Dwight Bullard voted against it. Gov. Charlie Crist approved the bill, which expanded the program by increasing the pool of eligible families and raising the cap on tax credits. • HB 859: This 2012 bill also made some changes to the same tax credit program, by again increasing the cap and removing the requirement that foster care students meet certain income requirements. Saunders voted in favor with the majority when it passed the house 92-24 on March 7, 2012, and it became law. Rep. Dwight Bullard voted no on this bill. A note of irony here: Sen. Larcenia Bullard voted yes in the majority when this passed the Senate. She’s now vice president of the committee criticizing Saunders for voting the same way. With the tax credits, the state doesn’t technically write the check: A business writes a check to a nonprofit for the scholarship and then the business gets a tax credit -- money that would have otherwise gone to state coffers, including some for education. Saunders said the scholarships, which he supports, cost less than the per pupil funding for public schools, so he argues that it saves money. The Collins Center for Public Policy concluded in a 2007 report that the tax credit program "did not have a negative impact upon K-12 General Fund Revenues for public education" and saved the difference between the value of the scholarship and the value of K-12 per pupil revenue. "Make college less accessible by restricting Bright Futures scholarships" The mailer cites one vote, on HB 5201. This postsecondary education funding bill included several changes for Bright Futures, the college scholarships designed to keep students at Florida schools. Among the changes were reducing the scholarship by $1 per credit hour and tightening eligibility requirements in an effort to save money amid a budget shortfall. The bill passed the house 93-26 on April 30, 2010 -- a few months before Scott was elected governor. It passed the Senate and Crist approved it. But here’s the interesting part: Both Saunders and Bullard voted no. "Give extra tax breaks to the wealthiest Floridians while so many families are struggling" The mailer cites two votes: • HB 913: This bill passed April 6, 2010, a few months before Scott was elected governor. This bill gave a tax break for the purchase of airplanes by fractional owners. There were approximately 385 Florida owners of fractional airplane interests in 2006. This passed the House 109-7 with Saunders voting "yes" with the majority, and Rep. Dwight Bullard voting no. What made it into law was an economic development bill, SB 1752, that included the aircraft provision and that passed the House and Senate unanimously. • HB 7185: This vote made some changes related to corporate income taxes. It passed the Senate unanimously on May 3, 2011, and then two days later passed the house 110-5. Saunders voted in the majority -- as did Bullard. (About a week earlier they split their vote on a version of the bill, with Saunders voting yes and Bullard no.) The bill updates the Florida Income Tax Code to reflect changes made by Congress. Florida businesses with taxable income of less than $25,000 will not have to pay any tax, staff analysis stated. The Tampa Bay Times wrote that the bill resulted in a tax break of $1,100 a year on average for 15,000 small businesses as first step in effort to cut the state's annual $2 billion corporate tax. Neither of these bills were partisan in nature or unique to Scott’s agenda; both passed with overwhelming majorities in both chambers. Saunders response The biggest weapon in this mailer is the overall theme of telling Democratic primary voters that Saunders stands with Scott and helped him achieve legislative victories. That message isn’t true, Saunders argued. As the Democratic leader, it's Saunders job to bash Scott’s proposals, as he did in his responses to Scott’s State of the State addresses in 2011 and 2012. Saunders also said that he -- and Bullard -- were recognized by the liberal group Progress Florida as being among the 27 "middle class champions" in 2012. These champions voted against bills that would hurt the middle class including "Gov. Scott's anti-middle class budget (which) continues to dramatically underfund Florida's public schools," Progress Florida wrote. Our ruling An electioneering communication organization headed by state Rep. Dwight Bullard’s father said that one of his son’s opponents, State Rep. Ron Saunders "has helped Gov. Rick Scott." Let’s review their evidence for each one: "Take money from public schools by expanding vouchers": This is the only part of the mailer that comes anywhere close to truth. The mailer cites two votes Saunders took to expand tax credits. But the mailer omits any explanation about the minimal impact on public school funding. "Make college less accessible by restricting Bright Futures scholarships": The mailer cites a vote that trimmed Bright Futures, which Saunders voted against. So the mailer fails to support this argument. "Give extra tax breaks to the wealthiest Floridians while so many families are struggling": Saunders voted to provide a tax credit for people who share airplanes, but this was a very narrow tax break for a tiny group of people. He also voted to reduce the state’s corporate income taxes. What is most misleading about this ad is the broader message that Saunders made a choice to "stand" with Scott. Did Saunders vote for some bills that Scott signed into law? Yep -- but that doesn’t mean he supports Scott’s overall agenda. It’s a ridiculous idea that the Democratic minority leader is "supporting" Scott and "helped" the Republican governor in any concrete way. It is that overall message here and the images of Saunders and Scott shaking hands -- not the nitty gritty votes in small print -- that will catch voters’ eyes. For that misleading characterization, and the criticisms we noted about the bills cited, we rate this claim False.

pomt-06435	Says there's $4 billion in private investment along the streetcar.	mostly false	/oregon/statements/2011/oct/22/sam-adams/mayor-sam-adamas-city-say-streetcar-attracted-4-bi/	Elected officials love to talk about private sector investments in public infrastructure. It’s a way to show that they are on the job, promoting development and growth and jobs for other people. A prime example is Portland’s streetcar system, which opened in 2001. In August, Portland Mayor Sam Adams gathered with others to toast the streetcar’s 10th anniversary. Adams highlighted the thousands of jobs created by the building and operating of the streetcar, not to mention the "jobs created by that $4 billion in private investment" along the streetcar line. A news update posted to the mayor’s website, again, mentioned "roughly $4 billion in private investment along the current line." (The post has been updated.) We were curious to know how the mayor got his figure, and whether it truly was $4 billion in private money. Some background: The city broke ground in 1999 for a streetcar loop from Northwest Portland to downtown. In 2001, the line opened, later extending to South Waterfront. Next year, service is scheduled to start on the east side. We asked the mayor’s office and Portland Streetcar Inc., the nonprofit that operates the system for the city, for figures to back up the $4 billion assertion. In return, we received an April 2008 document that lists $3.5 billion of development within three blocks of the streetcar. It’s a widely disseminated figure used to pitch streetcars in Oakland and in Tucson. Portland Streetcar Inc. then produced a list of projects since 2008 that add up to $735 million, bringing the total estimate to $4.2 billion. These include projects along the unfinished line; some have been started, and some have not. It’s true that many of the projects on the development lists are private, such as the $300 million Brewery Blocks in the Pearl and the $150 million twin Meriwether condos in South Waterfront. But there are others that definitely are not private. For example, Oregon Health & Science University’s Center for Health and Healing in South Waterfront cost about $140 million, and a number of long planned projects at Portland State University were estimated at $217 million. That’s $357 million right there that probably shouldn’t be listed as private-sector investment. Also, the $295 millionLife Sciences Building is a joint venture between OHSU and the Oregon University System, and is financed with state bonds, the medical university and university fundraising. Again, we consider that public support, even with fundraising by the university. More than half of the $50 million Bud Clark Commons comes from urban renewal dollars -- in other words, from taxpayers -- so that’s pretty much a public project as far as we’re concerned. The same goes for Tamarack, a$50 million mixed-use affordable housing complex in South Waterfront on track to open next year. Let’s say, conservatively, a combined $50 million should be knocked off the estimate. The list also includes $31 million for Memorial Coliseum, $17 million of which would come from urban renewal funds. Again, that’s not private development money. So where does that leave us? Well, we’ve counted at least $700 million in public investment. We’re also going to knock off $96 million because one project was counted twice, so really the $4.2 billion is closer to $3.4 billion. Perhaps you think us nitpicky, but this is the kind of inflating that drives PolitiFact Oregon nuts. Public officials shouldn’t hype private development to help justify taxpayer spending, in this case, on a transit system that has its share of critics. While we’re on the topic of inflating, we’re also not sure it’s fair game to include projects that probably would have been built anyway, such as the $65 million Fox Tower in downtown, half a block from a Max line. The list also includes more than $200 million in other projects constructed before 2001 downtown and in the Pearl -- two areas the city long had plans to revitalize. So it’s hard to say whether that much investment would have happened without the streetcar. A study by the Federal Transit Administration analyzed Portland’s system and found that: "Anecdotally, the initial stage of the system is credited by the operator with stimulating accelerated development of condominiums and specialty retail in the Pearl District, an area that was already undergoing some urban revitalization before the streetcar, as part of Portland’s urban renewal process. This area garnered substantial press in the late 1990s, when a major developer who had promoted the streetcar concept agreed to build higher densities when streetcar funding was finalized." To be absolutely clear, there have been hundreds of millions of private dollars invested along the line, resulting in more retail space and housing. We can’t say definitively how much of that development is there because of the streetcar. But we can knock off at least $800 million from the estimated $4.2 billion in private investment -- and that doesn’t even include projects that may be near the streetcar even if the streetcar isn’t the reason why the development is there. We presented our findings to Amy Ruiz, a spokeswoman for the mayor. She said in an email that he should have referred to "$4 billion in public and private investment, or simply in investment," and that the online posts have been corrected. Adams spoke of thousands of "jobs created by that $4 billion in private investment" along the current line. There may have been that much money total -- although it’s still not clear how much is directly attributable to the streetcar -- but it wasn’t all private. We rate the statement Mostly False: It contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression. Return to OregonLive to comment on this ruling.

pomt-11664	"Delta Force raids Obama stronghold in Thailand."	pants on fire!	/punditfact/statements/2018/jan/08/someonesbones/fake-news-military-raided-obamas-compound-thailand/	A fake news story said that President Donald Trump greenlit a pre-dawn raid on a mansion and compound owned by former President Barack Obama in Thailand. "Delta Force raids Obama stronghold in Thailand," said a Dec. 27 headline on the website Someonesbones.com. Facebook users flagged the post as being potentially fabricated, as part of the social network’s efforts to combat fake news. The photo of the alleged Obama compound in Thailand is actually a resort, and a Pentagon spokesman told PolitiFact that the story was false. Someonesbones describes itself as "primarily dedicated to exploring the Nibiru realities and exposing scientific and govermental corruption." (Yes, the website can’t spell "government" and says that the government and mainstream media are liars.) The story by Someonesbones has no actual evidence and quotes an anonymous source who said that Obama owns real estate and shadow companies across the globe. The story said that Obama, by proxy through the Solyndra Corporation, owned a mansion and a 400-acre estate in Thailand. Solyndra was a solar company that received money as part of the stimulus package. The U.S. Department of Energy invited Solyndra to apply for money in 2006 before Obama took office. The collapse of Solyndra in 2011 became political fodder leading up to the 2012 election. In Someonesbones’ made-up raid, Delta Force seized several encrypted laptops and over 200 million dollars in gold bullion, in addition to dozens of crates containing Chinese-manufactured firearms and explosives. (The only truthful part of that is Delta Force is an actual elite counter-terrorism unit.) Another sign that this is fake news: the story identified the prime minister of Thailand as Nik Bukharin while the actual prime minister is Prayuth Chan-ocha. (Nikolay Ivanovich Bukharin was a Soviet political leader who died in 1938.) The story had green and black images of what appeared to be military officers in night vision goggles. We searched the photos on Google images and one appeared to be similar to an image used in a 2013 story about the movie Zero Dark Thirty, which was about the hunt for Osama Bin Laden. The photo of the fictitious Obama compound in Thailand is actually Villa Rak Tawan, a luxurious estate in Phuket used for vacations and weddings. Someonesbones.com said "Delta Force raids Obama stronghold in Thailand" but we found no evidence that such a raid occurred. We rate this headline Pants on Fire.

pomt-10591	Said he's the only Republican candidate "who's actually turned around a government economy."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/jan/28/rudy-giuliani/a-real-turnaround/	Rudy Giuliani has run his campaign on two basic themes – leadership on 9/11, and the turnaround of New York City. At the Republican debate at Florida Atlantic University on Jan. 24, 2008, he made the turnaround of New York a point of contrast with his opponents. "I'm the only one who's actually turned around a government economy," he said. "And the reality is, when I became mayor of New York, the economy of New York was in very, very bad shape. Tremendous deficits, 10.5 percent unemployment, 300,000 jobs gone. We turned that around, cut unemployment by more than half, brought in 450,000 new jobs, and we cut taxes by 17 percent." And if you look at their records, at least in the fairly specific set of economic measures Giuliani listed, he is right. Two other Republican candidates held political offices that let them be compared on their "turnaround" ability: Mike Huckabee, who was governor of Arkansas for 10 years, and Mitt Romney, who was governor of Massachusetts for four years. Both men left office in January 2007. Giuliani was mayor of New York for eight years, 1994-2001. Sen. John McCain has never held an executive position and thus has no record of economic turnaround. The turnaround in New York is widely known. (We addressed it with this look at his luck with the budget deficit and this look at his claim of cutting taxes.) Giuliani had the wind at his back nationally: His years as mayor coincided with one of the longest national economic booms in American history, with the Wall Street boom was one of the headline stories of the era. Yet Giuliani clearly imposed greater financial discipline, and the economic measures support his claim that New York City outperformed the national boom during his years in office. It is hard to argue that New York did not enjoy a substantial turnaround during the Giuliani years. Whether Giuliani deserves as much credit as he claims has been widely debated. The specifics of his claims have been evaluated before. He did not inherit a "tremendous" deficit any more than he left one. City budgets are required to be balanced, and Giuliani's budget directors have argued that budgets routinely show deficits at midyear (when mayors take office) but are resolved by year-end. Giuliani likes to decry the "deficit" he inherited from his predecessor, but dismisses the one he left for his successor by the same accounting. It's worth noting, in all the talk of how they cut taxes and balanced budgets (all of their governments required balanced budgets, unlike the federal government), none of the former government executives is saying he'll produce a balanced budget in Washington. In Massachusetts, it is perhaps noteworthy that Romney's book called "Turnaround" is not about his governorship but his tenure as CEO of the Salt Lake City Winter Olympics of 2002, a job he took at the beginning of 1999 when the Olympics had endured an ethics scandal and was projecting a substantial deficit. The measures Giuliani picks as indicators of turnaround in New York don't look so good for Romney's four years as governor – which is probably one reason Giuliani picked them. Giuliani's unemployment rate, for example, fell from 8.8 percent in 1994, his first year as mayor, to 6 percent his last year, though it held stubbornly around 9 percent for most of his first term. Romney, taking office a year after Giuliani left office, saw his unemployment rate fall from 5.7 percent to as low as 4.8 percent and then return to 5.3 percent. Employment hit a cyclical bottom a year after Romney came into office. In the South Carolina debate on Jan. 10, Romney said, "I'm very proud of the fact that after many, many months of declining job growth, I took over the state and helped turn that around. And in my years as governor, we kept adding jobs every single month after we saw that turnaround." The turnaround, though, started only after a loss of well over 20,000 jobs his first year in office. The tax burden in Massachusetts, for state and local governments combined, grew under Romney from 10 percent of personal income to 10.6 percent. Romney fought for a reduction in the income-tax rate, but the Democratic-controlled state legislature wouldn't go along. Giuliani claims he more or less bludgeoned New York's Democratic city council into becoming tax cutters. The tax burden fell in New York City – by nearly 20 percent, in Giuliani's calculation. (We evaluated that calculation in a previous story, here, and found it to be solid.) (Giuliani prefers to focus on the magnitude of change, rather than on national comparisons, because he says New York has traditionally underperformed the nation on many such economic measures.) Northeastern University's Center for Market Studies, looked at the economy three years into Romney's tenure and found it "lackluster," trailing national performance on a number of measures. One was job growth: It had none after three years under Romney. It had just gotten back to even with where he started. Now, for Huckabee, the story is a bit different. His tenure in Arkansas continued on through the much tougher economy of the last four years. Huckabee has spent a lot of effort trying to persuade people he cut taxes ("93 times," in his famous claim) when in fact the overall tax burden in Arkansas went up. If he talked more about turning around under-performance in the state's schools and roads, which he did to some extent and occasionally discussed, he might have claimed a different kind of "turnaround" mantle. Huckabee used a gas tax to rehab Interstate 40 through Arkansas – once designated as the worst stretch of road in the country by a survey of truckers – and a sales tax to reform an inefficient and unfair system of schools. Giuliani, on the other hand, did not significantly increase his city's investment in infrastructure. Giuliani's claim about being the "only turnaround" candidate does not incorporate the concept of additional investment and additional "return" in the form of better services. Comparing Arkansas and New York City "turnarounds" is almost imponderable. Huckabee, however, doesn't describe his tenure as a turnaround era in Arkansas. Giuliani's budget discipline did not allow for substantial new spending on infrastructure. Whether Huckabee's "investment" of higher taxes for better services was a good move is not is not a turnaround category Giuliani lists. It has to be kept in mind that the economic circumstances each chief executive faced were very different. Giuliani can't match Romney in the corporate turnaround business. And Giuliani's view of what constitutes a turnaround doesn't consider everything, but Giuliani clearly has clear accomplishments when it comes to a government turnaround. We find his claim Mostly True.	None	Rudy Giuliani	None	None	None	2008-01-28T00:00:00	2008-01-24	['Republican_Party_(United_States)']
pomt-01028	There were more people on welfare than working in 2013.	false	/punditfact/statements/2015/jan/28/terry-jeffrey/are-there-more-welfare-recipients-us-full-time-wor/	One of the turning points in the 2012 presidential campaign was Republican nominee Mitt Romney privately saying that 47 percent of the population -- supporters of President Barack Obama, he said -- were people who are "dependent upon government, who believe that they are victims, who believe that government has a responsibility to care for them, who believe that they are entitled to health care, to food, to housing, to you name it." The 2012 election is long over, but this theme -- sometimes framed as "makers" vs. "takers" -- is an enduring topic in American politics. Recently, the widely read conservative website TownHall.com posted a column by Terry Jeffrey, editor of the conseravative news service CNSNews.com, in which he compared Americans "on welfare" to those who are "full-time year-round workers." Specifically, Jeffrey wrote, there were more people on welfare than working. He wrote: "In 2013, according to the Census Bureau, there were 105,862,000 full-time year-round workers in the United States -- including 16,685,000 full-time government workers. These full-time workers were outnumbered by the 109,631,000 whom the Census Bureau says were getting benefits from means-tested federal programs -- e.g. welfare -- as of the fourth quarter of 2012. "Every American family that pays its own way -- and takes care of its own children whether with one or two incomes -- must subsidize the 109,631,000 on welfare." A reader asked us to take a closer look at Jeffrey’s column, so we did. We found that the numbers he cited are real, but his descriptions of those numbers, and thus his interpretation, were off base. (Jeffrey did not return an inquiry for this article.) The number 109,631,000 does, as Jeffrey wrote, refer to the Census Bureau’s figure for the number of Americans receiving benefits from means-tested federal programs. And the Bureau of Labor Statistics’ figure for full-time workers was pretty close to his stated 105,862,000 for 2013, although not all of these workers necessarily worked all year. But his comparison is a case of apples and oranges. We found three broad concerns about Jeffrey’s characterization, which we’ll take in order. The term 'welfare' is being used at its most expansive. The word "welfare" has different meanings for different people. Many think it refers to cash payouts to people who aren’t working; others think it includes anyone who receives government assistance of any type. Jeffrey has chosen to use the most expansive definition. The number Jeffrey cited includes the "traditional" type of welfare, such as Temporary Assistance to Needy Families, or TANF, but also programs such as Medicaid and food stamps. In fact, the beneficiaries in the Census Bureau’s accounting who received TANF and other cash-based payments were dwarfed by those who received Medicaid, food stamps and the food program called Women, Infants and Children, or WIC -- the three most widely used categories in the agency’s accounting. Jeffrey isn’t wrong to frame it that way, but it’s worth noting that the definition he’s used broadens the universe of recipients. The number includes many children and senior citizens. Jeffrey doesn’t take into account that the Census Bureau arrived at its figure by counting "anyone residing in a household in which one or more people received benefits from the program." This means the agency would count an entire family of four as receiving means-tested benefits as long as one individual within the family received such benefits. On its own, this definition is defensible. If one person in a household qualifies for food stamps, then the food purchased with those funds will likely be shared among all family members. However, the problem arises when Jeffrey compares this number to the number of full-time workers. He’s not comparing the number of households with a means-tested beneficiary to the number of households with a full-time worker. That would have been an apples-to-apples comparison. Rather, he’s comparing the number of households with a means-tested beneficiary to the number of full-time workers. This matters because it juices the numbers, effectively increasing the number of people on the welfare side of the comparison. Children and senior citizens can be counted as receiving means-tested benefits, but children cannot legally work, and many senior citizens may be retired or physically unable to work due to age. The difference isn’t trivial. In 2013, more than half of Medicaid recipients -- 51 percent -- were children, and another 5 percent were over 65, according to the Census Bureau. This pattern skews the comparison Jeffrey is trying to make. The number of 'welfare' recipients actually includes many workers. Just because you’re receiving means-tested benefits doesn’t mean you’re not working. According to 2012 Census Bureau data, roughly 23 percent of households with at least one working adult received means-tested benefits. For Medicaid, 28 percent of recipients between the ages of 18 and 64, worked full time, according to the Census Bureau. (Another 15 percent of recipients in that age group worked part time.) Other means-tested benefits show considerable overlap with the population of working adults. Roughly 60 percent of food stamp recipients who were of working age and weren’t disabled were employed while receiving benefits, according to a Census Bureau sample calculated by the liberal Center for Budget and Policy Priorities. This matters because working recipients of means-tested benefits would be counted on both sides of the comparison, casting doubt on the notion that there’s a strict divide between people who work and people who are on welfare. Our ruling Jeffrey said that in 2013, there were 109,631,000 Americans "on welfare," outnumbering the "105,862,000 full-time year-round workers in the United States." While the claim is based on real numbers, it’s a fundamentally flawed, apples-and-oranges comparison. The number of "welfare" recipients -- unlike the number of workers -- is enlarged by the inclusion of children and senior citizens. The comparison also ignores that many "welfare" recipients actually work, so trying to separate the two categories creates a false dichotomy. We rate the claim False.

pomt-12178	Says Dontre Hamilton "was shot 14 times by police for resting on a park bench in Milwaukee."	mostly true	/wisconsin/statements/2017/aug/01/gwen-moore/case-dontre-hamilton-did-milwaukee-police-shoot-ma/	On the floor of the U.S. House of Representatives on June 29, 2017, U.S. Rep. Gwen Moore, D-Milwaukee, declared: Dontre Hamilton "was shot 14 times by police for resting on a park bench in Milwaukee." Is that what happened? The incident can be viewed in at least two different ways. Literally speaking, Hamilton was not killed simply for resting on a bench. He was shot after striking an officer with the officer’s baton. But in making a rhetorical point, Moore is correct that Hamilton had done nothing to attract the attention of police but fall asleep in a park. And the fatal shooting occurred after two other officers had twice observed Hamilton and determined he was doing nothing wrong. Moore’s comments Moore took to the House floor to promote a bill she introduced three days earlier. Under the measure, states and localities receiving certain federal grants would have to require their law enforcement officers to undergo training on "de-escalation techniques to assist in reducing the need for the use of force" by officers. She made her claim about Hamilton after arguing that her bill should be made law before summer ends, saying: We know that kids are out of school and that the tensions in our streets are high. Police on alert, and far too many of us are distrustful of the police due to the painful and frightful memories of how many deadly encounters have dominated headlines -- close to a thousand in one year. How can this Congress recess for the summer and not take up this bill? Yes, the Affordable Care Act is a big issue here before us in Congress. But if you live in communities of color around the country, the immediate health care issue for you is being shot by a police officer who has been sworn to protect you. If you die at age 12, like Tamir Rice, who was shot by police for playing with his sister on a playground in Cleveland, how can you be concerned with the Medicaid? If you’re killed at 31 years old like Dontre Hamilton, who was shot 14 times by police for resting on a park bench in Milwaukee, nursing home care is not your priority. You won’t have the fortune of living that long. Her office did not respond to our requests for information for this fact check. The Hamilton incident Hillary Clinton injected the Hamilton incident into the 2016 presidential campaign. At a Democratic debate with Bernie Sanders in Milwaukee, she said Hamilton was "unarmed" when he was killed. Our rating was Mostly True. Hamilton, a 31-year-old diagnosed with schizophrenia, had a history of contacts with Milwaukee police, but no convictions for any violent crimes. He was shot to death by Christopher Manney, a Milwaukee officer who worked in the downtown area, on April 30, 2014. Manney was fired -- not for the fatal shooting itself, but for the way he approached Hamilton, which led to a scuffle. Here’s a summary of the incident from our Clinton fact check, based on a report by the Milwaukee County district attorney: First call: Shortly before 2 p.m., an employee at the Starbucks located in Red Arrow Park downtown called police about Hamilton, who was sleeping in the park. The call was classified as a "welfare check" -- in other words, to check if Hamilton was OK. A desk sergeant called Manney’s cell phone and left a voicemail message, saying he wanted Manney to go to the park about "a homeless guy sleeping" there. Two officers respond: Because Manney didn’t immediately respond to the voicemail, the Starbucks call was referred to a dispatcher, who then dispatched two other officers to the park. They found Hamilton lying on his back with his eyes closed. They nudged Hamilton, he got up and provided identification and said he was taking a nap and was all right. The officers left. Second call: About 2:10 p.m., another call to police about Hamilton came from Starbucks. The two officers returned and told the employees that Hamilton was not doing anything wrong. The officers left shortly before 3 p.m. Manney responds: Just before 3:30 p.m., about 90 minutes after the first call, Manney listened to the voicemail. He called dispatch and asked if there was an assignment for Red Arrow Park. Told there was not, Manney asked "that he be recorded as responding to a trouble with subject" call, and he went to the park. He apparently was not aware the other officers had preceded him. Fight occurs: Manney approached Hamilton, who was lying down, helped him up and then began to pat him down. Hamilton resisted. Witnesses told police that Manney, who was yelling commands at Hamilton, struck Hamilton one or more times with his baton before Hamilton took the baton and struck Manney with it one or more times. Manney shoots Hamilton: The witnesses said Hamilton was holding the baton -- one said menacingly -- when Manney fired his service weapon. He fired 14 times, resulting in 15 gunshot wounds to Hamilton. In announcing Manney’s firing, Milwaukee Police Chief Edward Flynn said Manney decided Hamilton was dangerous "based solely on observations of apparent mental illness, absent any overt actions on the part of Mr. Hamilton." Our rating Moore says Hamilton "was shot 14 times by police for resting on a park bench in Milwaukee." Two officers twice responded to calls about Hamilton sleeping in the park and allowed him to continue sleeping there and left. He was still resting there when a different officer later and arrived and began patting him down. That triggered a physical altercation, with the officer hitting Hamilton with his baton and then Hamilton taking the baton and striking the officer. The officer then fatally shot Hamilton 14 times. In short, Hamilton was not shot simply for resting on a park bench. But the shooting occurred only because of a physical altercation that was sparked by the way the third officer began patting Hamilton down -- after two officers who came to the park twice decided Hamilton wasn’t doing anything wrong. In fact, the officer was fired for the way he approached Hamilton. For a statement that is accurate but needs additional information, our rating is Mostly True. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com Hamilton shooting aftermath Manney fired: In October 2014, Milwaukee Police Chief Edward Flynn announced he had fired Manney -- not for use of excessive force when he shot Hamilton, but because he did not follow department rules for dealing with emotionally disturbed people in the moments leading up to the shooting. $2.3 million settlement: In May 2017, more than three years after Hamilton’s death, the Milwaukee Common Council approved paying $2.3 million to Hamilton’s young son to settle a federal civil rights lawsuit. Use of deadly force fact check: Flynn said in June 2016 that Milwaukee police use deadly force at a rate that is "among the lowest" in the country. Our rating was Half True. The best data available then showed Milwaukee police killed one person in 2015. But 2015 was the only full year for which data were available on a national level, so it wasn’t known how Milwaukee’s rate would compare in prior years.

pomt-15235	Illegal immigration "wasn’t a subject that was on anybody’s mind until I brought it up at my announcement."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/aug/07/donald-trump/trump-illegal-immigration-wasnt-anyones-mind-he-en/	Donald Trump’s signature self confidence was on full display at the first Republican debate. He was the sole candidate on the stage who refused to pledge to support the eventual Republican nominee. When Fox News moderator Chris Wallace challenged him to provide evidence to back up his claim that the Mexican government is intentionally sending criminals across the border, Trump had this rebuttal. "If it weren’t for me, you wouldn’t even be talking about illegal immigration, Chris," Trump said. "You wouldn’t even be talking about it. This wasn’t a subject that was on anybody’s mind until I brought it up at my announcement." In light of the prominent role immigration has played in the Republican Party, that is a bold assertion. We decided to see what the record says. We attacked this in two ways. Since Trump directed his comment at Wallace, we looked at the transcripts from Wallace’s show, Fox News Sunday. We also cast a wider net by searching the Nexis database of major newspaper articles. Both approaches show Trump has an exaggerated sense of his role in the Republican primary. Chris Wallace Trump made his presidential announcement speech on June 16, 2015. In the seven broadcasts of Fox News Sunday before that day, immigration policy came up in five shows. Wallace himself raised the issue with Republican candidates Ohio Gov. John Kasich, Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, former Pennsylvania Sen. Rick Santorum, and in the context of a discussion about former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush. Substitute hosts for Wallace also talked about immigration policy. In the seven broadcasts after Trump’s announcement speech, immigration policy again came up five times. In fairness to Trump, often this was in reference to the billionaire from New York. For example, when Wallace had another GOP contender on his show, former Texas Gov. Rick Perry, he asked him this: "You have done more than just fire back on Trump on the issue of immigration. You devoted a major speech to Donald Trump in which you accused him of a, quote, ‘toxic mix of demagoguery, mean-spiritedness and nonsense.’ " So Trump has been a focus of conversation, but on Wallace’s show, the topic of immigration reform came up just as often before Trump announced as afterward. Major newspapers We used the Lexis-Nexis database to count the number of times illegal immigration or undocumented immigrants came up in major newspapers in the days before and after Trump’s announcement on June 16. For the curious, it has been 51 days since Trump jumped into the race for the White House. We compared the number of mentions in that period to those during the 51 days prior to his announcement. This table shows the tally for mentions of two terms -- "undocumented" and "illegal immigrant" -- within 10 words of the word "president." Date range Search term Number of articles April 25 to June 15 Undocumented 65 June 16 to Aug. 6 Undocumented 42 April 25 to June 15 Illegal immigrant 60 June 16 to Aug. 6 Illegal immigrant 79 Source: Lexis-Nexis So, the topic of undocumented immigrants came up more often before Trump announced his run through this lens.Articles using the term "illegal immigrant" appeared slightly less often before he gave his speech, but mentions were still relatively common -- and certainly not zero. Our ruling Trump said that if it weren’t for him, Wallace in particular and the media in general wouldn’t be talking about illegal immigration. The numbers tell a very different story. For Wallace and his Fox News show itself, the topic came up just as frequently before Trump announced as afterward. For mentions in major newspapers, the pattern is somewhat mixed, but mentions were common before Trump announced. There’s no doubt Trump’s bombastic comments brought additional attention to the issue, but the issue was on the minds of the media -- and politicians -- before Trump entered the fray. But Trump stated that the topic would not be on the table at all if not for him. That is clearly not the case. We rate this claim False.

pomt-09316	"The bill reported out of committee sets up a $50 billion slush fund that, while intended for resolving failing firms, is available for virtually any purpose that the treasury secretary sees fit."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/apr/16/richard-shelby/sen-richard-shelby-overlooks-safeguards-financial-/	Now that the health care debate has come to a close, lawmakers are prepping their talking points for the next looming battle: financial institution reform. Alabama Sen. Richard Shelby, the top Republican on his chamber's Banking Committee, aired his grievances in a March 25, 2010, letter to Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner. The letter was largely prompted by Shelby's concern that in a recent speech Geithner mischaracterized the senator's support for financial regulation. Shelby also took the opportunity to point out several ways that he believes the legislation his committee recently approved is flawed. "The bill reported out of committee sets up a $50 billion slush fund that, while intended for resolving failing firms, is available for virtually any purpose that the treasury secretary sees fit," Shelby wrote on March 25, 2010. "Nonetheless, the mere existence of this fund will make it all too easy to choose bailout over bankruptcy. This can only reinforce the expectation that the government stands ready to intervene on behalf of large and politically connected financial institutions at the expense of Main Street and the American taxpayer. Therefore, the bill institutionalizes 'too big to fail.' " We wondered whether Shelby is correct about a fund that can be used for whatever purpose the treasury secretary sees fit. First, the details of the bill. On March 22, 2010, the Senate Banking Committee, chaired by Sens. Christopher Dodd and Shelby, approved the overhaul by a party-line vote of 13-10. Highlights include new government authority to regulate over-the-counter derivatives and hedge funds, a new consumer financial product regulator within the Federal Reserve, and a process for dissolving institutions that are teetering on collapse. The "Orderly Liquidation Fund" is the technical term for the $50 billion pot of money Shelby is concerned about. Only the largest firms would be required to pay into the fund. If a "systematically significant" firm is teetering on collapse, the Treasury, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. and the Federal Reserve would have to agree to use the fund to liquidate the firm. A panel of three bankruptcy judges would have to convene and agree within 24 hours that the company is insolvent. The fund is not meant to replace the bankruptcy process, but rather to provide a sort of emergency mechanism for the government to deal with very large, economically significant institutions. So, the bill provides quite a bit of structure around how the government would decide which firms should be dissolved. Shelby is clearly correct on his first point that there is a $50 billion fund in the bill (we'll leave the debate over the definition of "slush fund" for another day) that's "intended to resolve failing firms." The second part of his claim is that the fund is available for "virtually any purpose that the treasury secretary sees fit." First -- because we like to split hairs -- we should note that, while the bill says that the fund will be established in the Treasury Department, it will be administered by the FDIC, an independent branch of government, not the Treasury Department. Whether the money can be used for anything the government wants is another matter. The legislative language is pretty clear that the money must be used to dissolve -- meaning completely shut down -- failing firms. Here's what Sec. 206 of the bill says: "In taking action under this title, the (FDIC) shall determine that such action is necessary for purposes of the financial stability of the United States, and not for the purpose of preserving the covered financial company; ensure that the shareholders of a covered financial company do not receive payment until after all other claims and the Fund are fully paid; ensure that unsecured creditors bear losses in accordance with the priority of claim provisions in section 210; ensure that management responsible for the failed condition of the covered financial company is removed (if such management has not already been removed at the time at which the FDIC is appointed receiver); and not take an equity interest in or become a shareholder of any covered financial company or any covered subsidiary." The fund cannot be used to keep faltering institutions alive. What about bonuses? "It certainly cannot be used for bonuses or salaries going forward," said Dana Chasin, legislative and policy liaison for the Americans for Financial Reform, a coalition of generally left-leaning groups in support of financial regulatory reform. By definition, the fund would be used to dissolve companies all together; management would be summarily forced out in the process. However, it is possible that "costs associated with liquidation could involve claims'' for prior compensation agreements held by the company, which could involve bonuses, Chasin conceded. "There are certain kinds of contracts that may or may not be repudiated," he said. James Gattuso, a senior fellow at the conservative Heritage Foundation, says he's concerned about how the money might be used, but the bigger issue may be limited standing for anyone to file a suit to prevent misuse of the fund. "A similar problem developed under the TARP legislation -– under which GM and Chrysler got funding although no serious analyst argued that they were 'financial institutions,' as required under TARP," Gattuso wrote to us in an e-mail. "There simply was no judicial review of the action available, because no entity had the requisite standing. A similar problem could develop under this legislation." David Zaring, a professor at the Wharton School of Business, said that the bill does seem to give the government some leeway in reinterpreting the fund in the future through the rulemaking process. "Shelby may be concerned because the bill gives [the government] modest rulemaking authority on how it construes the fund and some opportunities to reinterpret it," he said. "However, that rulemaking authority is limited. I don't see any sort of blank check in that." So, when it comes to the fund, it's clear that it can only be used to cover costs associated with shutting down a firm altogether, not to keep a firm afloat. But several of the people we spoke with pointed out that the bill is a bit vague in some areas, at least in their view. And indeed, the bill provides some flexibility in how funds are used during liquidation. That said, it's an overstatement for Shelby to say that the fund "is available for virtually any purpose that the treasury secretary sees fit." We also take issue with Shelby's underlying point, that the fund somehow encourages firms to take a bailout rather than bankruptcy. In fact, the rules of the fund dictate that it not be used to maintain companies that are bad for our financial system, but rather to shut down those companies altogether, a process akin to bankruptcy. Shelby also implies that the fund comes at a cost to taxpayers, saying the fund "can only reinforce the expectation that the government stands ready to intervene on behalf of large and politically connected financial institutions at the expense of Main Street and the American taxpayer." But remember, the businesses would pay into the liquidation fund, not taxpayers. The bill is very specific about that. So his underlying point here is incorrect. Shelby is right that the bill would create a $50 billion fund to help dismantle very large, faltering firms. While there may be just a bit of wiggle room on what costs the fund covers, the bill makes it clear that the money must be used to liquidate -- not keep alive -- failing firms. Also, the program is administered by the FDIC, and before it can step in to dismantle a firm, FDIC must have agreement of the Treasury, the Federal Reserve and three bankruptcy judges. So, to say that the fund "is available for virtually any purpose that the Treasury Secretary sees fit," is more than a stretch. We find Shelby's claim to be False.

pomt-09540	Says his executive order requiring young girls to be vaccinated against HPV wasn't mandatory.	mostly false	/texas/statements/2010/feb/06/rick-perry/perry-says-hpv-vaccine-he-mandated-would-have-been/	When Gov. Rick Perry issued an executive order in 2007 requiring all Texas girls to receive a vaccine against the human papillomavirus before entering the sixth grade, lawmakers balked and blocked it. Critics said the vaccine, Merck & Co.'s Gardasil, was too new to declare safe. Some said too that Perry's order would infringe on parental rights or give girls a false sense of security, leading them to be sexually active too young. Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison, one of Perry's opponents in the GOP gubernatorial primary, frequently slams Perry's stilled order. Perry has stood by his action, most recently casting it as having created an optional vaccination requirement. "That piece of legislation was not mandatory, in the sense of when you can say no, something's not mandatory," he said during the second Republican gubernatorial debate Jan. 29. A just-say-no gubernatorial order? We decided to check. What we found: On Feb. 2, 2007, Perry issued an executive order — not a piece of legislation, as he said — requiring the Texas Health and Human Services Commission to adopt rules mandating all girls entering sixth grade to receive a vaccination against the types of HPV, a sexually-transmitted virus, that causes most cases of cervical cancer and genital warts. The order included an opt-out "in order to protect the right of parents to be the final authority on their children's health care." Perry ordered the Department of State Health Services to allow parents dissenting for philosophical or religious reasons to request a conscientious objection affidavit form. That form, which has been available since 2003, enables parents to enroll their children in public school even if they lack state-required immunizations. It's automatically granted as long as parents provide all required information. According to the Department of State Health Service's 2008-09 immunization report, which uses data from kindergarten and seventh-grade students at 1,300 independent school districts and 800 private schools, 0.28 percent of the students filed conscientious objection forms. Parents must renew exemption affidavits every two years to maintain their validity, according to Allison Lowery, assistant press officer at the Texas Department of State Health Services. We thought the opt-out form for public-school students proved Perry correct until we learned that not all private schools accept the affidavit. That means some private schools may not allow their students to exempt themselves from any state-required vaccinations. Some 15 percent of more than 1 million Texas girls in fifth through 12th grade in 2008 were enrolled in private schools, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. According to a 2006 Texas Attorney General's opinion: "A private school that does not accept state tax funds is not required to accept for enrollment a child who has received an exemption from the immunizations required by the Texas Health and Safety Code." In its policy for Catholic schools, the Catholic Diocese of Austin states: "Immunizations are not in conflict with the Catholic faith. Conscientious objections or waivers, which may be permissible for enrollment in public schools, do not qualify as an exception to this policy." Catholic schools in the diocese do accept medical exemptions, meaning if the immunization could somehow harm the child, it's not required to enroll. We wondered if the diocese's policy in favor of requiring state-mandated immunizations would have extended to refusing the opt-out form for girls subject to the HPV vaccination. Perry aides may have had the same question. According to internal e-mails published online by Hutchison's campaign (also obtained by the Austin American-Statesman under Texas open records laws in 2007), Brandon LeBlanc, then the governor's community affairs public liaison, wrote Feb. 6, 2007: "I don't have an answer for the questions I'm getting regarding private schools. Apparently Catholic schools in particular will require all state vaccines, but won't except (sic) the exemptions. My first inclination, assuming this is true, is that this is for the parents and the schools to sort out. Is there a better answer to this 'problem'?" Nora Belcher, then assistant director at the Governor's Office of Budget, Planning and Policy, replied: "I believe in the short term your answer is the correct one, plus, enrolling in Catholic school is a CHOICE (for parents, anyway)." In February 2007, the Roman Catholic Bishops of Texas came close to saying they wouldn't require the vaccine, issuing a statement recommending that "civil authorities should leave this decision to parents." But would parochial schools absolutely have left that particular vaccination decision to parents? Margaret McGettrick, director of education at the Texas Catholic Conference, the statewide association of the Roman Catholic diocese in Texas, recently said the superintendents, bishops and accreditation commission at the association responsible for setting school policies never formulated policy specific to the HPV vaccine. McGettrick said "it's a non-issue for us" because the HPV vaccine was never added to the state's list of required immunizations once lawmakers froze the order until the starting date of the 2011 regular legislative session. Allison Castle, Perry's press secretary, said: "We consider (the order) null and void and (Perry) will not pursue it in the future." En breve: Perry did issue an order requiring schoolgirls receive the HPV vaccine. In arguing that his order was not a mandate, Perry points to the Conscientious Objection to Immunization form that lets parents of public school students decline immunizations without consequence. The burden to file and refile the notarized forms on time falls on the parents. However, our research determined that it's not certain the opt-out would have been accepted for the 15 percent of Texas girls attending private schools. Also unknown: Whether every Catholic school would have allowed students subject to Perry's order to abstain from the three HPV shots in the vaccination series. Ultimately, the governor issued an order for the Health and Human Services Executive Commissioner to "adopt rules that mandate the age appropriate vaccination of all female children for HPV prior to admission to the sixth grade." According to the Merriam-Webster dictionary, a mandate is "a clear instruction, authorization or direction." Perry says the executive order wasn't mandatory, which, according to Webster, means "demanded or required." But that's what Perry's order did: it set up a requirement. Just because there's a loophole — a way to "say no," in the governor's parlance — doesn't mean the requirement doesn't exist. Physical education classes are also mandatory to graduate high school, but if you have any number of health conditions, you can skip the timed mile. We rate Perry's claim Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.

pomt-02817	"These 60 acres (the Atlanta Braves want to build a stadium on) have produced zero SPLOST money for parks and recreation, have produced zero money for education."	mostly true	/georgia/statements/2013/nov/26/john-loud/cobb-businessmans-claim-new-atlanta-braves-stadium/	By Eric Stirgus The proposed new home of the Atlanta Braves is a large swath of heavily wooded land that could be a hit for Cobb County government and schools if the baseball team moves there, some supporters of the plan say. "These 60 acres have produced zero SPLOST money for parks and recreation, have produced zero money for education," said John Loud, who owns Loud Security, based in Cobb. True? PolitiFact Georgia thought we’d do some digging. Loud, along with Superior Plumbing owner Jay Cunningham, have spearheaded an effort to rally public support in favor of the plan. The two men led a campaign for a 1 percent sales tax for education in Cobb County and the Marietta city school system that passed in March. Loud said he was referring to sales tax money from the land that has gone back to the county government or school system. "There’s no sales tax that comes out of those acres," he said. The Braves have secured land within the Cumberland Community Improvement District, team officials say. The team plans to use 60 acres for the stadium and development, the Braves say. The Cumberland CID is an area approved to tax businesses within its borders. The land is located just north and west of I-75 and I-285. The team wants to build a 41,500-seat stadium, along with an amphitheater, stores and restaurants leading up to the ballpark. The Atlanta Journal-Constitution has identified several parcels where it believes the Braves want to build the new stadium and other development. The Braves declined to identify the parcels that have been secured, citing a confidentiality agreement. The team did say it believes the land is undeveloped. A Cobb County government spokesman agreed. "It’s all vacant land," said the spokesman, Robert Quigley. Cobb, like most metro Atlanta counties, collects a 1 percent special purpose local option sales tax on most items sold in local businesses to pay for the construction of new government buildings, roadways and equipment. Quigley said the county cannot collect SPLOST proceeds from vacant property. As for whether the property has produced zero money for education, that’s a more complicated element to Loud’s claim. Cobb collects about $140,000 a year in school taxes from the land, Quigley said. Our total, based on the parcels the AJC believes the Braves have secured, was close, at nearly $143,000. Loud was aware of how much money is collected in property taxes for the school system when PolitiFact Georgia gave him a call. He stressed he was talking about sales tax revenue in The Marietta Daily Journal article. "There’s no commerce (there), so there’s no sales tax generated," said Loud, who believes the county will collect millions of dollars annually from the land if it is developed by the Braves. To sum up, Loud said the 60 acres the Atlanta Braves are considering as part of a stadium development have produced no SPLOST money for parks and recreation and zero money for education. The site’s owners currently pay property taxes that go to the county’s school system. Loud said he was referring to sales tax revenue from the land. His quote in the newspaper article could had been clearer about the point he was trying to make. There is some additional detail that must be understood for anyone who reads Loud’s quote.

pomt-11192	Antonio Villaraigosa's "recklessness (as mayor of Los Angeles) ... left no funding to test 7,000 rape kits, putting public safety at risk."	false	/california/statements/2018/may/16/john-chiang/fact-checking-tv-ads-false-claim-antonio-villaraig/	A new TV ad in the campaign for California governor attacks former Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa for what it calls his "reckless" role in Los Angeles’ massive rape kit backlog. But is it accurate? The ad was paid for by the John Chiang for Governor campaign. It began airing in markets statewide this past weekend. Chiang, the state treasurer, and fellow Democrat Villaraigosa are in a tight and increasingly heated primary race with several others to emerge as one of the top two candidates in November’s general election. Lt. Gov. Gavin Newsom, also a Democrat, is considered the race’s frontrunner. Below is the part of the ad that attacks Villaraigosa. For this fact check, we focused on the last portion about his role with the rape kit backlog: "He was called ‘a failure.’ An ‘embarrassment.’ As mayor, Antonio Villaraigosa drove L.A. to the brink of bankruptcy," a narrator says, as news headlines from 2009 and 2010 flash on the screen. "Villaraigosa’s recklessness threatened jobs, the economy and left no funding to test 7,000 rape kits, putting public safety at risk." The ad above was paid for by the John Chiang for Governor campaign. Villaraigosa served as mayor of Los Angeles from July 2005 to July 2013. The ad seizes on critiques of the former mayor during the height of the Great Recession, when cities and states across the country slashed budgets as tax revenue cratered. More specifically, the ad addresses the frustratingly slow process of clearing rape kits in California, as well as nationwide. State lawmakers this week held a press conference on a bill that would require the prompt testing of all kits in the state. Last month, Chiang made a similar call to action when he announced the circulation of a petition to have all rape kits in the state tested immediately. The use of DNA testing to find suspected criminals gained renewed attention with last month’s arrest of the suspected Golden State Killer, Joseph James DeAngelo, who faces a dozen murder charges across California. Investigators said they have also linked him to nearly 50 rapes and three attempted sexual assaults from 1976 to 1986. Given the importance of this law enforcement tool, we wanted to know whether the TV ad accurately describes Villaraigosa’s role in LA’s pileup of untested rape kits. We set out on a fact check. Background on the LA backlog An October 2008 audit by Los Angeles Controller Laura Chick detailed the extent of the rape kit backlog. It criticized the Los Angeles Police Department for its lack of a comprehensive plan to end the backlog and its mismanagement of federal grants awarded for DNA testing. Specifically, the LAPD lost nearly $500,000 in grants for testing due to its "lax oversight" of the money, Chick wrote in the report. "Right now the Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD) has about 7,000 rape kits sitting on freezer shelves waiting to be analyzed. Despite having been awarded nearly $4 million in grant funds for the LAPD's crime lab, this unacceptable backlog still exists." The audit was sent to Villaraigosa, who along with the LA City Council was responsible for oversight of the LAPD, as well as establishing its priorities. Chick did not place blame solely on the former mayor, nor did she describe any reckless acts that prevented funding. Instead, her audit spreads blame across city leadership. "How is it possible we are in this situation?" she wrote. "The answer is simple and obvious: The City, its elected leadership, as well as the Police Department, has not given this issue the attention, resources and priority it deserves." Evidence from Chiang’s campaign We asked Chiang’s campaign for evidence supporting the ad’s claim that Villaraigosa’s "recklessness" … "left no funding" for the DNA testing. A spokesman pointed to several news articles and editorials that criticized LA city leadership for not acting fast enough to fund crime lab technicians. Some mentioned Villaraigosa’s focus on hiring more police officers in contrast with lab techs. "Hiring more officers remains a worthy goal," The Los Angeles Times editorial board wrote in October 2008, "but it need not be done foolishly and with contempt for rape victims whose cases deserve attention. The City Council -- and the LAPD -- must make funding the necessary lab work a priority." More specifically, Chiang’s campaign pointed to a May 2008 request by the city’s finance committee to add $400,000 to Villaraigosa’s budget for LAPD contractual services to pay for DNA testing, which they say he denied. The city’s June 2008 budget signed by Villaraigosa however, shows the police budget for contractual services increased by $400,000, suggesting he did approve the increase. The request for additional funds was made by former LA City Councilman and prosecutor Jack Weiss, who The Pasadena Star-News editorial board said in August 2008 had been "complaining about the backlog of criminal lab work for years, noting that it hasn’t been the priority it should." The editorial also said Weiss in 2007 "called the backlog of criminal-case DNA the ‘public safety scandal of our era,’ and asked Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa and (then-LAPD Chief William Bratton) to hire new criminalists. He said he would push the council for $10 million in funding for this problem this year. That funding has not materialized, and the backlog hasn’t gone away." Weiss could not be reached for comment. Villaraigosa campaign’s response A Villaraigosa campaign spokesman said the ad is wrong for two reasons: the backlog started before Villaraigosa became mayor in July 2005 and was eliminated under his watch in 2011. The audit backs up the first point. It shows the backlog had reached 3,300 rape kits by 2003, two years before Villaraigosa took office. On the second point, several news articles detail the city’s elimination of the backlog in 2011, two years beforeVillaraigosa’s tenure as mayor ended. The Los Angeles Times in April 2011 reported on the elimination of what it called a "decades-old" backlog: "LAPD officials have spent the last two years scraping together federal grants, public funds and private donations to outsource the testing to private labs. They have also lobbied elected officials for special permission to add more analysts to the LAPD's lab despite a citywide hiring freeze." Our ruling A TV ad by John Chiang’s campaign for governor attacked former Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa for what it calls his "reckless" role in the city’s massive rape kit backlog. It said he "left no funding to test 7,000 rape kits, putting public safety at risk." A Los Angeles city audit from 2008 blamed elected leaders and the Los Angeles Police Department for their lack of attention and resources paid to the problem. The audit notes, however, the problem started well before Villaraigosa took office. Also, it doesn’t single out Villaraigosa and we found no evidence of any "reckless" acts by the former mayor. Additionally, the ad ignores the fact that the city eliminated the backlog near the end of Villaraigosa’s term in 2011. It gives the wrong impression that Villaraigosa "left no funding" whatsoever to pay for DNA testing when his tenure ended. That’s simply not the case. We found plenty of information that criticized Villaraigosa and the city for a slow start to addressing the problem. Chiang’s ad, however, distorts the facts and creates a narrative that’s simply not supported. We rated the ad’s claim False. FALSE – The statement is not accurate.

pomt-09336	"The policy of the Bush administration was also not to add new nuclear capabilities."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/apr/11/robert-gates/defense-secretary-robert-gates-says-bush-administr/	The Nuclear Posture Review released by the Obama administration this week has several key points. It says that the United States will not develop new nuclear warheads, that programs to extend the life of the existing arsenal would rely on previously tested designs, and that the United States will not support new nuclear military capabilities. That's a break from the policy of George W. Bush, who proposed new nuclear warheads that would be longer-lasting, reliable and provide greater flexibility to ultimately reduce the nation's nuclear stockpile. On ABC's This Week on April 11, 2010, Defense Secretary Robert Gates said the policy objectives of the two administrations are not that different. "The reliable replacement warhead program that existed in the past was really a means to an end," said Gates, who served in the same job for President Bush. "It was a means to modernizing the nuclear stockpile ... making it more reliable, safer, and more secure. The policy of the Bush administration was also not to add new nuclear capabilities. This was about how do you make the stockpile safer and more reliable." President Barack Obama's Nuclear Posture Review outlines a plan to modernize the existing nuclear arsenal without creating new warheads. If replacement of nuclear components is deemed critically necessary, the Pentagon would need the okay of the president and Congress. Gates said that plan "offers us a path forward, as Secretary Clinton says, in terms of reuse, refurbishment, and -- and if necessary, replacement of components. Not an entire warhead necessarily. So the chiefs, and I and the directors of the nuclear labs are all very comfortable this puts us in a position to modernize the stockpile." Here, we are focusing on Gates' claim that, "The policy of the Bush administration was also not to add new nuclear capabilities." That may be how the Bush policy ended up, but early on Bush championed a plan to develop a nuclear "bunker-buster" weapon. Bush's 2001 Nuclear Posture Review report stated that "a need may arise to modify, upgrade, or replace portions of the extant nuclear force or develop concepts for follow-on nuclear weapons better suited to the nation's needs." Specifically, the report talks about the need to develop weapons to get at a growing number of "hard and deeply-buried targets." That led to Bush administration proposals in 2003 and 2004 to modify existing warheads to develop a nuclear "bunker buster" -- formally known as the "Robust Nuclear Earth Penetrator" -- that would use a nuclear warhead to destroy underground targets. But Congress repeatedly balked, and the nuclear weapon was never built. Obama, we note, was among those who voted against the program in 2005. "Congress basically said, 'No, you can't have it,' " Darryl Kimball, executive director of the Arms Control Association, told PolitiFact. The Bush policy then evolved toward modernizing the arsenal without adding to the U.S. nuclear capability. Bush proposed the Reliable Replacement Warhead Program, which sought to design new warheads with more long-term reliability, allowing the United States to continue to reduce its aging nuclear stockpile. The weapons could only have the same explosive power and be suited for similar targets as existing ones. That's what Gates meant when he said the Bush policy was not to add new nuclear capabilities. Congress denied funding for the program in 2008. Some were concerned it sent the wrong message to other countries that the United States was trying to persuade not to pursue nuclear arms; and others feared it might open the door to new nuclear weapons testing. Congress then passed the Stockpile Management Plan, which seeks to extend the life of the nuclear arsenal without building wholly new warheads. Gates makes a valid point that the Bush policy in the later years of his presidency -- while it called for the development of new nuclear warheads -- did not call for new nuclear capabilities. That's where Bush's policy ended up. But early on, the Bush administration did call for modifications to existing weapons to create a nuclear "bunker buster" that very much would have added to the United States' nuclear capabilities. And so we rule Gates' claim Half True.	None	Robert Gates	None	None	None	2010-04-11T17:59:45	2010-04-11	['George_W._Bush']
pomt-10187	"But if my opponent had his way, the millions of Floridians who rely on it would've had their Social Security tied up in the stock market this week."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/sep/22/barack-obama/obama-overstates-mccains-plan-whatever-that-is/	With the stock market on a roller coaster last week, Sen. Barack Obama decided it was a good time to take a shot at Sen. John McCain on Social Security. McCain has, in the past, supported plans that would allow workers, if they want, to have a portion of their Social Security put into personal retirement accounts that allow investment in the stock market. "And I’ll protect Social Security, while John McCain wants to privatize it," Obama said in a speech in Daytona Beach, Fla., on Sept. 20, 2008. "Without Social Security half of elderly women would be living in poverty — half. But if my opponent had his way, the millions of Floridians who rely on it would’ve had their Social Security tied up in the stock market this week. Millions would’ve watched as the market tumbled and their nest egg disappeared before their eyes. Millions of families would’ve been scrambling to figure out how to give their mothers and fathers, their grandmothers and grandfathers, the secure retirement that every American deserves. So I know Senator McCain is talking about a 'casino culture' on Wall Street — but the fact is, he’s the one who wants to gamble with your life savings." To be sure, it was a volatile week on Wall Street. Down 504 points Monday; up 141 Tuesday; down again, 449 points Wednesday; then back up again 410 points Thursday; and up another 319 Friday. The market ended up down just 34 points for the week. But whew, there was certainly a lot of angst. But there are a couple problems with Obama’s attack on McCain’s plans for Social Security. First and foremost is that McCain hasn’t actually laid out his plan for Social Security. In July, McCain was asked it. "I cannot tell you what I would do, except to put everything on the table," he told reporters. A few weeks later, he was asked about new taxes to shore up Social Security. "There is nothing that’s off the table. I have my positions, and I’ll articulate them. But nothing’s off the table," McCain said. "I don’t want tax increases. But that doesn’t mean that anything is off the table." We’re still waiting to hear McCain articulate his positions. "No one really knows what his plan is, including him," said John Rother, policy director at AARP. McCain’s statements on Social Security so far have been "too contradictory or too vague," to pin down, he said. To make any statements about McCain’s plan going forward would require a bit of mind-reading, Rother said. In lieu of that, we think it’s fair for Obama to take aim at McCain’s previous support for personal retirement accounts. In 1998, McCain voted in favor of a budget amendment to express "the sense of Senate" that any budget surplus should be used to reduce Social Security payroll tax and to establish personal retirement accounts. The vote — 50-48 in favor — largely came down along partisan lines. And in 2005, McCain supported President George W. Bush’s push to allow workers to divert a portion of the program’s payroll taxes to personal investment accounts. McCain supported Bush’s plan, going so far as to accompany the president on a series of town hall meetings in March 2005. The plan fizzled, though, and the initiative went down as one of Bush’s biggest defeats in domestic policy. McCain has since modified his stance. When we wrote about McCain’s plan back in April, McCain’s campaign Web site stated that McCain "supports supplementing the current Social Security system with personal accounts — but not as a substitute for addressing benefit promises that cannot be kept. John McCain will reach across the aisle, but if the Democrats do not act, he will." That’s no longer on the Web site, and the McCain campaign did not respond to an e-mail seeking to clarify his position on Social Security. We’re not inclined to give McCain a pass just because he has failed to articulate his plan. But Obama’s statement is misleading, even when judged against McCain’s earlier support for Bush’s plan. First, Obama seems to be suggesting that today’s retirees would have had their Social Security tied up in the volatile stock market this week. The Bush plan for personal investment accounts would not have applied to those retirees currently getting Social Security. No one born before 1950 would have been eligible to participate in the investment plan; so only people 58 or younger. McCain stressed that point in a town hall meeting in New Hampshire on June 12, 2008. "I will not privatize Social Security, and it’s not true when I’m accused of that," McCain said. "But I would like for younger workers, younger workers only, to have an opportunity to take a few of their tax dollars, and maybe put it into an account with their name on it. That’s their money. ... And we will make sure that present-day retirees, I will commit, have the benefits that they have earned." We also think Obama may have been guilty of using some scare tactics here. For one, participation in the Bush program would have been entirely voluntary. Second, without signing a waiver, upon turning 47, the accounts would have been invested in a "life cycle portfolio," shifting from higher risk growth funds to secure bonds as people neared retirement (and thereby protecting near-retirees from sudden market swings). And last, people would have been able to set aside in their investment accounts only up to 4 percentage points of their payroll taxes (currently 12.4 percent), so only a little over a quarter of one’s Social Security taxes could have been invested. In short, it would have been impossible to see one’s entire nest egg disappear in a down market. And people would have been allowed to choose only from a small number of diversified index funds, preventing people from putting large portions of their retirement savings in just a few stocks. Obama spokesman Tommy Vietor told PolitiFact that Obama wasn’t necessarily talking about current retirees. "You don’t have to be retired to rely on Social Security," Vietor said. "Millions of people who will one day retire rely on Social Security as they plan their futures. Senator Obama’s bottom line is absolutely true. If McCain got his way and we had private accounts (a position he started articulating as early as 1998), people who are relying on that money for their retirement would be in a very difficult situation." There is a legitimate point to be made that to the extent that a person's Social Security plan is tied up in investment accounts, it is certainly subject to the vagaries of the stock market. But we are of the opinion that when Obama talked about "the millions of Floridians who rely on it" he was talking about current retirees. While McCain has remained vague about his plans for Social Security, he has never expressed support for a plan that would allow current retirees to invest a portion of their Social Security in stocks, and neither did the Bush plan McCain once backed. We rule Obama's statement False.	None	Barack Obama	None	None	None	2008-09-22T00:00:00	2008-09-20	['None']
pomt-01561	Says Michelle Nunn has acknowledged allowing a convicted felon to hold a fundraiser for her.	mostly true	/georgia/statements/2014/sep/12/ending-spending-action-fund/super-pac-attacks-nunn-fundraising-blunder/	The super PAC Ending Spending Fund is broadcasting another attack ad against Michelle Nunn, a politically pedigreed Democrat hoping to succeed Republican Saxby Chambliss as a U.S. Senator from Georgia. This time, it’s a radio ad simulating a man-on-the street interview with a potential female voter. In the ad, the announcer says: "According to news reports, she’s acknowledged allowing a convicted felon who is well known for his radical anti-American statements to actually hold a fundraiser for her." He then asked the unidentified woman: "Is there any wisdom in that thinking?" "I’m going to say "None," the woman responds. It’s part of a new campaign by Ending Spending that plays off Nunn’s well-known name. Her father, Sam Nunn was a respected moderate Democrat in the U.S. Senate for 24 years, from 1972 to 1997, who some considered White House or vice presidential material. The ad follows the theme of the super PAC’s new website, www.AbsolutelyNunn.com, which answers the question, is there any reason for Georgians to vote for her? But, PolitiFact Georgia wondered, is Nunn working with felons to win office? First, let’s look at Ending Spending Action Fund, formed by TD Ameritrade founder Joe Ricketts. As of Sept. 11, the group has spent nearly $2.8 million -- more than any other outside group -- on Georgia’s Senate race, according to OpenSecrets.org. The PAC favors Nunn’s GOP opponent, businessman David Perdue. Some of its money paid for ads during the contentious Republican primary earlier this year. The race is being closely watched, and heavily funded, nationally because of the tight battle for control of the U.S. Senate. It’s also a priority for state Democrats eager to reclaim a major statewide office. The Nunn-Perdue battle has drawn the fifth-most money from outside groups in Congressional races across the nation this year, $12.4 million on ads from both sides. That brings us back to the ad, which is a reference to the July 8 Washington, D.C. fundraiser that featured Sam Nunn as a special guest. Virtual Murrell is listed as one of the co-hosts of the event, giving $2,600 to Nunn’s campaign for the honor. Guests paid at least $250 to the campaign to attend, according to the invitation. Two days after the fundraiser, the conservative National Review broke the story that Murrell, now a political consultant, had pleaded guilty in 1995 to accepting a bribe while working as an Oakland (Calif.) City councilman’s aide. He was sentenced to a year in prison. Nunn expressed surprise at the news of Murrell’s history, which also includes a stint in the 1960s as a leader in the Black Panther movement. Her campaign declined this week to make her available to discuss the fundraiser and its fallout. Spokesman Nathan Click referred us to a statement released in July, which said Nunn was unaware of Murrell’s record and promised to return contributions linked to him. Click, however, declined to confirm the exact amount of money the campaign said was returned or to disclose how much money was tied to Murrell. "We didn't deposit any contributions from him or anything he raised for the event," Click said in a statement. We reached out to Murrell via email, to confirm that Nunn returned his donation and other he raised. He did not respond. We also contacted Brian Baker, Ending Spending’s president, who said Nunn has acknowledged Murrell, a convicted felon, co-hosted a fundraiser for her. That "is exactly what we say in the ad," Baker said. "The ad is 100 percent factual." The event wasn’t the campaign’s only embarrassing moment. In late August, a series of confidential memos were leaked, revealing Nunn’s campaign strategy and vulnerabilities. Ironically, those documents may support the campaign’s contention that Nunn didn’t know Murrell’s background. On page 57 of the 144-page document – after listing vulnerabilities such as being linked to President Obama and before several pages laying out campaign issues – is a category called "Vetting. It takes up less than a quarter of the page, most notably this one-sentence paragraph: "Currently, there are no plans to vet donors to the campaign," the memo said. Baker said finding out Murrell’s background "didn’t require a complicated vetting process" and was accessible with a basic Google search. PolitiFact Georgia has reviewed previous ad claims from the group, with mixed results. In August, Ending Spending ad’s claim that Michelle Nunn’s "foundation directed grants to an Islamic group tied to radical terrorists" earned a Mostly False. In July, we rated as Mostly True an Ending Spending claim that Nunn earned as much as $300,000 from Points of Light around the time it laid off 90 workers due to its merger with the nonprofit Hands on Network. Available information on the latest claim suggests Ending Spending’s new ad uses guilt by association in a bid to suggest Nunn knowingly wooed an inflammatory ex-convict to raise cash for her Senate bid. Nunn has repeatedly said she did not know Murrell’s history when she attended the fundraiser. She pledged to give back the money he raised, though the campaign and Murrell have not confirmed how much was determined to be linked to Murrell. Most of the statement from the Ending Spending attack ad is correct. A convicted felon did host a fundraiser for Michelle Nunn. Nunn has said she did not know anything about the man’s criminal background. And there is evidence from a leaked memo that her campaign was not vetting donors. The claim is accurate. But it leaves out some relevant details. We rate it Mostly True.	None	Ending Spending Action Fund	None	None	None	2014-09-12T00:00:00	2014-08-29	['None']
pomt-15193	"There’s a tremendous other number of public officials who have done the same thing" as Hillary Clinton with a private email server.	mostly false	/punditfact/statements/2015/aug/18/howard-dean/howard-dean-tremendous-number-public-officials-hav/	Morning Joe co-hosts Mika Brzezinski and Willie Geist tried a number of ways recently to get Howard Dean — former Democratic National Committee chairman and ardent Hillary Clinton supporter — to admit Clinton erred in using a private email server as secretary of state. Each time, Dean stood firm in his support for the Democratic presidential candidate. Geist then asked Dean how he would feel about a Republican doing what Clinton did. "Howard, is it fair to say if this were a Republican secretary of state, and someone you were not supporting for president," asked Geist, "you would be troubled by a secretary of state having a private email server in his or her home?" "No, I wouldn’t," Dean replied, cutting Geist off, "because I used to do that as governor, and I know there’s a tremendous other number of public officials who have done the same thing." Geist followed up, "And would only use a private server for State Department emails?" Dean demurred, saying whatever she was done was within the constraints of the law at the time. (Whether Clinton violated State Department protocols or the law is unclear.) We wanted to check Dean’s claim that he used a private server during his days in office and that the practice is widespread among politicians. Dean’s emails Clinton has drawn criticism for conducting government business through an email address privately hosted on a server at her home in Chappaqua, N.Y., instead of through the State Department's system. On Morning Joe, Dean equated her actions with his own, as well as a "tremendous" other number of officials. So we looked into Dean’s record for insight into his past email practices. We reached out to Dean through Democracy for America, the grassroots organizing group he founded, but didn’t get a response for the story. Dean, who was governor of Vermont from 1991 through 2003, faced questions about his email in 2001 when a concerned citizen requested to see his correspondence with a ski resort developer, according to an article in the Rutland Herald. Dean’s lawyers at the time said the emails were exempt from release because they were conducted through the governor’s private account. The article also mentions that Dean used neither a government-issued email address nor the computer supplied to him by the state. Vermont state archivist Tanya Marshall said Dean’s administration did not transfer any emails to the state records office at the end of his tenure. So Dean clearly used a private email account while he was governor. But we could find no evidence that he used a private server as well. And there's a difference. In fact, only one other politician is on record as doing the same: Clinton’s Republican presidential rival Jeb Bush. As Florida governor from 1999 to 2007, Bush used a private server for both his personal email account and the accounts of some of his staffers. Account vs. server Many politicians use private addresses, but private servers like the one Clinton had in her basement are rarely seen, said John Wonderlich, a policy director of the Sunlight Foundation, a nonpartisan group focused on government transparency. And there’s a big difference between a private account, which is generally free and simple to start, and a private server, which requires a more elaborate setup. Two other presidential candidates, Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal and former Texas Gov. Rick Perry, used private email accounts hosted by large services like Google during their time in office. With services such as Gmail, messages they sent would have been stored on Google’s own servers around the world. While Google has a high level of security, email data stored on these kind of large commercial servers is often mined internally, for marketing purposes, for example, Wonderlich said. The Atlantic speculated the Clintons "may have wanted to be in control of the encryption of their correspondence, ensuring that no third parties — whether commercial, hacker, or government — were able to snoop on them." The unorthodox approach has opened up questions about her system’s level of security. Because the server was set up outside the State Department’s proverbial security fence, "any protection … aside from the physical protection of the Secret Service — would have been limited to the Clintons’ own personal resources," according to a March 2015 article in Wired. If the server was managed without the help of a third party, "you would have to have a staff that’s keeping up with all the latest fixes," said Clifford Neuman, director of the University of Southern California’s Center for Computer System Security. "That can be hard with a small staff," he said. Clinton’s campaign says she used the private account and server out of convenience, and that "it enabled her to reach people quickly and keep in regular touch with her family and friends more easily given her travel schedule." While Clinton’s immediate predecessor, Condoleezza Rice, did not email extensively during her time in office, Colin Powell did use a private email address while he was secretary of state from 2001 to 2005. Powell, however, did not operate his own server. Our ruling In the context of discussing Hillary Clinton’s private email server for handling government business, Dean said, "I used to do that as governor, and I know there’s a tremendous other number of public officials who have done the same thing." It’s possible that Dean was trying to say that many public officials have used private email accounts. But by failing to mention that Clinton also set up her own server, he completely misses the point of Geist’s question. Besides Clinton, Jeb Bush is the only other official who used a personal server during his time in office. That does not speak to a "tremendous" trend. We rate Dean’s claim Mostly False.

pomt-01146	"This Congress made history as the least productive, most unpopular Congress in the history of this proud nation."	mostly true	/texas/statements/2014/dec/18/pete-gallego/pete-gallego-says-congress-least-productive-popula/	Calling for less partisanship, a Texan leaving the U.S. House lamented the bickering and pettiness around him. But one-term Democratic Rep. Pete Gallego of Alpine also made a grander claim, saying in his Dec. 10, 2014, floor speech: "This Congress made history as the least productive, most unpopular Congress in the history of this proud nation." We failed to reach Gallego, who lost his 2014 re-election bid to Republican Will Hurd. But Anthony Gutierrez, who helped Gallego’s campaign, sent an email pointing out a May 2014 Vox web post showing the latest Congress was stacking up poorly in productivity and popularity compared to any Congress since the 1970s. Productivity We’ve gotten into congressional productivity before, rating True a May 2014 claim by Rep. Joaquin Castro, D-San Antonio, that with only 67 bills or so passed into law, "2013 was the least productive year in congressional history since we’ve been keeping record." The office of the U.S. House clerk offers one-page detailed numerical recaps of each year’s congressional proceedings dating back to 1947. And according to the latest tally available when we looked, 114 "public bills" were passed into law by the House and Senate from early January 2014 through Nov. 30, 2014. That was an improvement in that 73 measures made it into law from early January 2013 into early January 2014, according to another office tally. In our previous look at productivity, we found previous low-end years including 1995 (88 bills passed into law); 2011 (90); 1981 (145); 1969 (190) and 2012 (193). Per these counts, Congress fared better in 2014. But we take it that Gallego was referring to the full Congress, meaning his claim to history covered its two years in session. And the 113th Congress, which passed 187 measures into law through November 2014, trailed the productivity of previous ones by a wide margin, according to the clerk’s tallies. The previous least-productive Congress was in session in 1995-96, ultimately advancing 280 measures into law, according to the clerk’s count. Next-worst was the Congress that gathered in 2011-12, which had 283 laws to its account. Popularity Was the latest Congress, which adjourned days after Gallego spoke, the least popular in history? From early 2013 through October 2014, according to results compiled at pollingreport.com, some 73 percent to 85 percent of respondents to more than 20 Fox News polls disapproved of Congress. Per the latest results when we looked, 80 percent disapproved "of the job Congress is doing," 13 percent approved, 7 percent were unsure. That poll of registered voters, conducted Oct. 25-27 by Anderson Robbins Research and Shaw & Company Research, had a margin of error of plus or minus three percentage points. In 2011-12, disapproval ratings in the Fox poll ranged from 60 percent of poll respondents to 83 percent, polllingreport.com says. In 2009-10, congressional disapproval ranged from 46 percent to 80 percent and in 2007-08, the disapproval range was from 44 percent to 77 percent, according to the website. In 2013-14, CBS News, asking poll respondents to approve or disapprove of "the way Congress is handling its job," found 75 percent to 85 percent disapproval. That range compared to CBS poll disapproval percentages of 62 to 84 percent in 2011-12; 55 to 82 percent in 2009-10; and 49 to 75 percent disapproval in 2007-08, pollingreport.com said. The latest result: 76 percent of 1,269 adults polled Oct. 23-27, 2014, disapproved, 14 percent approved, 10 percent were unsure; that poll had a margin of error of plus or minus three percentage points. Those are pretty dismal figures (unless, say, you don’t have a stake in Congress being well liked and respected and so on). But they don’t prove the 113th Congress was the least popular ever. Polls through history We asked Brian W. Smith, a political scientist at St. Edward’s University, for perspective. By email, Smith cautioned there has only been careful regular polling on attitudes about Congress since the mid-1900s, meaning it’s impossible to say for certain the latest Congress is the least-popular ever. The Gallup polling organization has inquired into attitudes toward Congress since 1974 and only started asking monthly in 2001. Smith noted the results show Congress never proving very popular, except after the 9/11 attacks, when there was a spike to 84 percent of respondents approving of the job Congress was doing. Source: Research by Brian W. Smith, associate professor of political science, St. Edward’s University (received by email, Dec. 11, 2014) Since 2001, Smith said, the Gallup poll indicates the latest Congress to be the least popular. Source: Research by Brian W. Smith, associate professor of political science, St. Edward’s University (received by email, Dec. 11, 2014) "It is fair to say that… this Congress will have the lowest approval since we began collecting data. This is true as an average, and the 113th Congress has the lowest single approval at 9 percent, which was in November 2013." Smith reminded, though, there is often a caveat. Though Americans tend to hate Congress in general, he wrote, voters tend to like their local representative, which "means that" even in "times of congressional disdain, incumbents do very well at the polls," Smith said. By email, congressional scholar Norman Ornstein agreed polling on the popularity of Congress only goes back a few decades. That said, Ornstein replied, it seems clear "the last two congresses are at the very low end of the spectrum since we've been recording these things systematically." Our ruling Gallego said: "This Congress made history as the least productive, most unpopular Congress in the history of this proud nation." This claim lacked caveats: There wasn’t polling on the popularity of Congress for most of its existence and productivity has only be yard-sticked since 1947. That said, it looks like the 113th Congress was the least productive Congress in nearly 70 years and the least popular one since relevant polls launched in the 1970s.

pomt-05716	Says pension contributions under Gov. Chris Christie would represent "75 percent of the total contribution made between the years 1995 and 2010. That's right, in 15 years, total state contribution was only $2.1 billion."	false	/new-jersey/statements/2012/mar/07/gary-chiusano/christies-pension-contributions-would-represent-75/	After just two years of making contributions to the state’s pension funds, Gov. Chris Christie apparently will be closing in on the total amount contributed by his five predecessors during a 15-year period. Well, that’s at least what one state assemblyman claimed in a recent TV appearance. With a combined pension contribution of nearly $1.6 billion over two fiscal years, Christie is on track to contribute 75 percent of the total state contribution made between 1995 and 2010, according to state Assemblyman Gary Chiusano (R-Sussex). Chiusano made that claim during a Feb. 26 interview on My9 News’ "New Jersey Now," when he appeared with Assemblyman Vincent Prieto (D-Hudson). The week before, the Republican governor unveiled his fiscal year 2013 budget, which includes a nearly $1.1 billion pension contribution. "Assemblyman Prieto is correct in terms of us funding the pensions by $1.1 billion, actually. And combine that with the contribution last year, the total…contribution by this Legislature and this governor is $1.6 billion," Chiusano told host Brenda Blackmon. "Brenda, that's 75 percent of the total contribution made between the years 1995 and 2010," Chiusano continued. "That's right, in 15 years, total state contribution was only $2.1 billion." PolitiFact New Jersey found that Chiusano needs to check his math, because he’s off by about $1.3 billion. Chiusano acknowledged in an e-mail that he mistakenly used the contributions made by former Gov. Jon Corzine to represent all of the contributions during that 15-year period. "You are correct. The figure I was using as a Grand Total was in fact a Sub Total," Chiusano told us. "The corrected statement in the future will be that Christie's total contributions to date will be 45.65% of the total contributed in 15 years of $3.4 billion. Thanks for catching that." Let’s explain how the pension payments break down. The governor’s fiscal year 2013 budget summary includes a page detailing pension contributions from fiscal year 1995 under then-Gov. Christine Todd Whitman to Christie’s proposed payment for fiscal year 2013. According to that page, the combined state contribution between fiscal years 1995 and 2010 was about $3.4 billion -- not the $2.1 billion cited by Chiusano. Here’s the pension payments by governor: Governor Fiscal Years Total Pension Contribution Christine Todd Whitman (R) 1995-2001 $963,934,000 Donald DiFrancesco (R) 2002 $563,000 Jim McGreevey (D) 2003-2005 $101,424,000 Richard Codey (D) 2006 $165,026,000 Jon Corzine (D) 2007-2010 $2,175,596,000 All Five Governors 1995-2010 $3,406,543,000 Between payments in fiscal years 2012 and 2013, Christie’s total pension contribution would be $1,555,237,000, according to the budget summary. Based on that figure, Christie’s total contribution would represent about 45 percent of the total payment made between 1995 and 2010. That’s 30 percentage points less than the 75 percent claimed by Chiusano. Our ruling In a TV interview, Chiusano claimed that Christie’s total pension contribution would represent "75 percent of the total contribution made between the years 1995 and 2010. That's right, in 15 years, total state contribution was only $2.1 billion." But according to the state Treasury Department, Christie’s total payment of nearly $1.6 billion would represent about 45 percent of the roughly $3.4 billion contributed between 1995 and 2010.

pomt-07020	Says that under City Council Member Randi Shade, Austin had the "highest city debt per person in Texas."	false	/texas/statements/2011/jul/06/better-austin-today-political-action-committee/austin-group-says-under-randi-shade-austin-has-had/	In a mailer backing Kathie Tovo over incumbent Austin City Council Member Randi Shade, the Better Austin Today political action committee recently said: "Under Randi Shade we have had ... the highest city debt per person in Texas." Numero uno? Jeff Jack, the group’s chairman, told us the debt ranking traces to survey results posted online by the Texas Municipal League from asking cities to share their debt levels. Jack said that he added up each city’s debt, listed on the survey, and divided that by each city’s population to come up with per-person totals; Austin, he said, finished first, at $6,291 per person. "There is quite a range when you start thinking about differences," Jack said. We turned next to the league, whose executive director, Bennett Sandlin, initially cautioned the survey results "are solely the result of city self-reporting" and have not been verified. At our request, the league took its survey results from 2008 through 2010 and calculated each responding city’s per-capita debt. Counting three types of debt -- general obligation, certificates of obligation and revenue-backed -- Austin ranked 10th among Texas cities in 2008 and 2009, at $5,643 per resident and $5,787, respectively, and ninth in 2010, at $6,291, Jack’s cited figure. Notably, much smaller cities showed greater per-person debt each of the years. In 2010, for instance, Johnson City and Galveston had more debt per person; the No. 1 per-person debt in the state appears to have been in Deport, which is 18 miles southeast of the East Texas city of Paris. So, Austin finished in the top 10 among cities that answered the survey, and it was by far the highest-ranking big city. In 2008 and 2009, cities with greater overall debt per capita topped out in population with Granbury, home to about 8,000 residents. Galveston, higher ranked in 2010, had 57,500 residents to Austin’s more than 750,000. However, Sandlin cautioned against making city-to-city debt comparisons that fold in outstanding revenue bonds. "The reason is that, unlike general-obligation and certificates-of-obligation debt, revenue bonds are typically not payable by the citizens through property taxes, but rather by the users of city utilities, such as water or electric (services)," he wrote. "Many city utilities serve areas far larger than city limits, so those debts are being serviced by non-citizens and thus might not be a fair measure of how much debt the citizens bear." In Austin’s case, Austin Energy, the city-owned electric utility serving residents of Austin plus the rest of Travis County and a portion of Williamson County, has more than $1 billion in outstanding revenue-backed debt and the city’s water utility, airport and convention center together account for more than $2 billion in revenue-supported debt, according to Art Alfaro, the city treasurer. Those debts, to rehash, are to be paid from revenue by the entities that issued them--and not from property tax dollars. Alfaro said in an interview that any fair city-to-city debt comparisons should be limited to general-obligation debt, the only kind backed by property taxes. Austin’s more than $800 million in this type of debt reflects bonds issued to build streets, libraries, parks and anything needed to run the city, he said, the vast majority approved by voters. Removing Austin’s revenue-backed debt changes its ranking considerably, the league’s survey results show. By this gauge, Austin was 208th among responding cities, at $871 per resident, in 2008 and 120th in 2009 and 2010, at $1,213 and $1,258, respectively. Not counting revenue-backed debt, among larger cities, Lubbock and Richardson had greater per-capita debt in 2010 and Houston’s per-capita debt was more than the debt for Austin in 2008 and 2009. By email, Jack said not counting revenue-backed debt doesn’t make sense: "If a business entity has a cost increase it passes that cost along to the consumer. In the same way revenue bonds, though not going through the (city’s) general fund, increase the cost indirectly through higher utility rates, user fees and the like," Jack said. It "all adds up … it is the total cost that must be considered." Separately, we asked Standard & Poor’s, which bestows credit ratings to cities, how it would analyze the per-capita debts of Texas cities. Dallas-based analyst Horatio Aldrete said the firm puts Austin’s "net debt"--less revenue-related debt but taking into account the general-obligation debts of overlapping jurisdictions such as Travis County and the Austin school district--at $3,664 per person. That’s compared to $3,600 in Dallas, $3,611 in Fort Worth, $4,700 in San Antonio and $4,000 in Houston. Austin, Aldrete said, is "kind of middle of the pack." Aldrete said it doesn’t fold in revenue-related debts because those are absorbed by rate payers, not the city. The firm’s Austin report says it raised its rating of Austin’s debt to "AAA" in 2008 "based on the likelihood that the city's employment base and fiscal policies should allow it to maintain its strong financial condition even during economic fluctuations such as the current recession." Our take? Taking into account all debts linked to the city, including revenue-backed debt, Austin didn’t rank first among Texas cities. And by a fairer comparison--focused on debts funded from property taxes--Austin landed way short of tops in Texas. Also, the statement’s laying of responsibility for the debt ranking on a single council member is unsupported. We rate the claim False.

pomt-14483	Says Travis County Commissioner Gerald Daugherty "claims to have taken a pay cut, but for 2016, he voted to raise his salary by 19.6 percent."	mostly false	/texas/statements/2016/feb/26/jason-nassour/challenger-levels-mostly-false-claim-about-gerald-/	With early voting in motion, Travis County Precinct 3 Commissioner candidate Jason Nassour charged his Republican primary opponent, incumbent Gerald Daugherty, with hypocritically voting himself a fat pay raise. "Your current county commissioner claims to have taken a pay cut, but for 2016, he voted to raise his salary by 19.6 percent," Nassour said on Facebook Feb. 18, 2016. SOURCE: Facebook post, Jason Nassour, Feb. 18, 2016 (screenshot Feb. 26, 2016) The first part of Nassour’s claim points to Daugherty touting his own fiscal frugality. On Daugherty’s campaign website, for instance, he says he has "taken an 8 percent pay decrease in each of the nine years he has been in office." That’s nine years in two chunks: Daugherty, a businessman, recaptured the seat representing western Travis County on the five-person commissioners court in 2012 after losing the spot in 2008. The other seats, including the county judge’s post, are held by Democrats. Nassour’s backup We asked Nassour, an Austin attorney, where he got his number for Daugherty’s vote for a steep salary increase. Nassour pointed us to a screenshot on his campaign Facebook page showing a portion of a Travis County budget document laying out the salary and benefits of the Precinct 3 commissioner in the 2014 and 2015 fiscal years and as proposed for the fiscal 2016 budget. By phone, Nassour said: "I took this right off the county website. I’ll be the first one to come out and say I’m wrong, but I’m in the business of looking at what’s on paper." The provided screenshot indicates $82,600 was to be spent on the Precinct 3 commissioner’s salary in 2015 and in the column for the fiscal 2016 proposed budget, the budgeted salary for the commissioner is $101,417, seemingly suggesting an even greater, 23 percent, surge than what Nassour declared. By phone, Nassour said he got the lower 19.6 percent figure by dividing $82,600 by $101,417 and subtracting the result from 1. Our sense: That’s not how to calculate the percentage difference (and by Nassour’s approach, we reached a different result, 18.6). County records To get a fix on the relevant figures, we turned to county records where we couldn’t find the $82,600 salary for 2015 in posted budget documents. On the county’s website, that is, the relevant document lists the Precinct 3 commissioner salary in 2015 as $90,109, identical to what the county spent on the salary the year before. To our request for clarification, Travis Gatlin, the county’s budget director, said it looked like Nassour compared actual amounts spent in 2014 and 2015 to the amount budgeted for the commissioner’s salary in 2016. His point: Actual amounts spent can be less than what the county budgets at the start of a fiscal year. By phone, Gatlin also said Nassour’s source documents appeared to be out of date. While the finalized budget was posted once approved at the end of September 2015, figures showing actual spending in 2015 were updated in mid-December 2015, Gatlin said, after expenditures were finalized for the fiscal year, which ran through September 2015, and all payroll information had been filed. The amount budgeted for each of the four county commissioner salaries in fiscal 2015, for instance, was $98,463. But in the 12 months, the county paid $90,109 for Daugherty’s salary, according to the budget’s 2015 actual expenditures data when we looked in late February 2016. Daugherty’s proclaimed lower pay So, take what Daugherty took in pay in 2015 and that breaks out to about 8 percent less than the budgeted base salary for each commissioner that year--as Daugherty says on his campaign website. But that’s not the full picture. After Daugherty rejoined the body in 2013, he accepted a salary of $90,109 for fiscal 2013, according to his signed affidavit. At the time, that was about 5.7 percent less (not 8 percent less) than the budgeted salary for each commissioner. In September 2015, most recently, Daugherty signed an affidavit saying he would take a salary of $93,000 in fiscal 2016, which was up $2,891, 3.2 percent, from what he took in pay for 2015. (If he had accepted the authorized $101,417, his pay would have increased nearly 13 percent, we calculate.) Daugherty’s vote Even if Daugherty didn’t take all of the higher base salary, did he vote for increasing it? When the commissioners began to consider raising their base salaries from $98,463 to $101,417, Daugherty voted against beginning the process of approving 3 percent raises for most county elected officials, according to the minutes of the body’s Aug. 11, 2015 meeting. An Austin American-Statesman news story published about the decisive meeting quotes Daugherty saying he thought the commissioners "ought to try to lead by example in elected officials," adding he would prefer if elected officials were required to ask the county for raises rather than garnering across-the-board salary increases. Records show, further, that Daugherty was absent from the Sept. 1, 2015, meeting at which the commissioners court set each commissioner’s 2016 salary at $101,417. Later, though, Daugherty joined his colleagues in voting for adoption of the full 2016 county budget, including the salary changes, at the body’s Sept. 29, 2015 meeting, according to meeting minutes. "When you vote for the budget, at the end it’s sort of a formality," Daugherty told us by phone. "The budget is done at that stage … It’s one of our responsibilities, and that happens every year. You don’t vote against the budget because there’s one thing you voted against." We shared the figures we found with Nassour, who said by phone that he believes he was misled by budget information posted by the county in September 2015. With regards to Daugherty’s reasoning on his vote for approval of the budget, Nassour said, "If you vote for the budget, you vote for what’s in it. I know that’s hard, because when you’re looking at the budget you’re looking at a lot … If there are things in the budget I don’t approve of, it’s my job not to vote for it" or "say I stand by it." Our ruling Nassour said Daugherty "claims to have taken a pay cut, but for 2016, he voted to raise his salary by 19.6 percent." It looks to us like Daugherty initially opposed certain pay raises for 2016 including those penciled in for commissioners. Still, he later voted for the budget including the raises. However, he personally set his own increased salary at an amount some $8,400 less than the newly authorized salary for commissioners. His pay went up 3.2 percent, not nearly 20 percent.

pomt-02928	Terry McAuliffe "wants to raise your taxes $1,700 to pay for his infinite promises."	false	/virginia/statements/2013/nov/01/ken-cuccinelli/cuccinelli-says-mcauliffe-wants-raise-average-fami/	Republican Ken Cuccinelli is closing his gubernatorial campaign with warnings to Virginia families about the price they’ll pay if Democrat Terry McAuliffe wins Tuesday’s election. "Terry also wants to raise your taxes $1,700 to pay for his infinite promises," Cuccinelli said during the final gubernatorial debate on Oct. 24. He’s makes the same claim on a number of ads, including a TV spot released on Oct. 29 that says, "Terry McAuliffe’s plan: expand Obamacare, increase spending, raise your taxes by $1,700." The tax charge originates from Cuccinelli’s estimate of the fiscal impact of various promises he says McAuliffe has made. Let’s look at how the Republican arrived at that number. Cuccinelli says the McAuliffe’s pledges add up to $14 billion in new spending over the next four years. About $12 billion of that sum stems from statements McAuliffe has made on three issues: public school funding, college debt and public teacher pay. On K-12 education, Cuccinelli points to a section on page 11 of McAuliffe’s platform where the Democrat laments cuts to school funding that the state made during the Great Recession and has not fully restored. "It’s time to restore those standards and make sure our schools have the tools they need to get the job done," McAuliffe’s platform says. Cuccinelli interprets that statement as a McAuliffe pledge to fully restore education money at the start of his administration. The Republican cites research by The Commonwealth Institute, a liberal think tank, which found that in inflation-adjusted numbers, the per-pupil general fund spending for K-12 students was about $5,000 during the 2007-08 school year fiscal year, but only about $4,000 this school year. With enrollment data from the Virginia Department of Education showing about 1.2 million K-12 students in 2012-13, Cuccinelli estimates that restoring per-pupil funding to 2007 levels would cost more than $1.2 billion annually, or $5 billion over a four-year McAuliffe term. The second biggest expense, Cuccinelli says, would come from what he interprets to be McAuliffe’s position on college debts assumed by Virginia undergraduates. Page 12 of McAuliffe’s platform says, "Every student deserves the opportunity to get a quality education and start their working lives without the burden of debt." Cuccinelli says that means McAuliffe is vowing to clear all Virginia students’ debts. Using figures from the Institute for College Access, which estimated that 2011 college graduates receiving a bachelor’s degree in Virginia had an average debt of $14,628, Cuccinelli estimated it would cost $667 million to pay off the loans of the entire class. Once rising enrollments and debt loads are taken into account, Cuccinelli says the total cost of this policy would be nearly $3.9 billion over the next four years. Cuccinelli also says McAuliffe has vowed to raise teacher pay in Virginia to the national average. He points to a May 25 speech in Manassas in which McAuliffe said, "as governor, I want to make sure that we pay our teachers the national average in order for us to get the best possible teachers." Cuccinelli took figures from the National Education Association showing there are 103,908 teachers in Virginia. During the 2011-2012 school year, Virginia instructors earned an average of $48,703. That was $6,715 below the national average of $55,418. Cuccinelli estimates it would cost about $700 million a year -- or $2.8 billion over four years -- to end the disparity. To compute the tax cost per family, Anna Nix, a Cuccinelli spokeswoman, says the campaign divided its estimated four-year, $14 billion cost of McAuliffe’s full agenda by four, which comes to $3.5 billion annually. Cuccinelli’s camp divided that yearly cost by the state’s population of 8.2 million and arrived at an estimate of $427 per person. So an average four-person family would pay slightly more than $1,700, Nix reasons. Josh Schwerin, a McAuliffe spokesman, dismisses Cuccinelli’s calculations, saying his campaign "is just making up numbers." "Terry has no plans to raise taxes," Schwerin said in an e-mail. He also denied that McAuliffe has made any of the three major promises Cuccinelli attributes to him. He said that McAuliffe’s comments on restoring public school funding, raising teacher salaries to the national average and easing college students’ debts merely reflect his boss’s "spending priorities." "It would be irresponsible to say how much you’re going to spend before knowing how much revenue there will be," Schwerin wrote. Cuccinelli’s $1,700-a-year tax estimate assumes McAuliffe will accomplish all of his policy ambitions during his first months in office without reducing any governmental expenses. McAuliffe has pledged to "save millions of taxpayers dollars through operational efficiencies," but his plan is not greatly detailed. He’s broadly called for reducing government energy costs, cutting state employee travel expenditures and streamlining agencies. Cuccinelli’s estimate assumes there will be no increase in state revenues during a McAuliffe governorship, ignoring that general fund tax receipts have risen by an annual average of 3.7 percent over the last three years. It also assumes McAuliffe will fail to convince the General Assembly to expand Virginia’s Medicaid program to reap federal dollars available under Obamacare. There may be good reason for Cuccinelli’s hunch: the Republican-led House is staunchly opposed to the enlargement. McAuliffe says the expansion could produce $500 million a year in new revenues and savings, but some predict analysts predict the annual yield may only be $50 million. Cuccinelli’s tax estimate also ignores some standard practices in state budgeting. For example, it assumes that the state would pay the entire cost of raising average teacher salaries to the national average. Virginia traditionally shares the cost of increasing teachers’ pay with localities. Our ruling Cuccinelli says McAuliffe wants to raise taxes by $1,700 annually for an average four-person family to pay for his "promises." The major problem is that Cuccinelli’s claim is based on his own interpretation of McAuliffe’s agenda. He assumes, for example, that McAuliffe’s statement that college graduates "deserve the opportunity" to start their careers without the burden of student debts is a promise that the state will pay off their loans, starting his first year in office. He assumes McAuliffe’s statement that "it’s time" to restore per-pupil funding in public schools to pre-recession levels is a vow to do that instantly. Then, Cuccinelli takes his assumptions and multiplies them by a stew of worst-case scenarios to come up with his unreliable tax estimate. We don’t fault Cuccinelli for demanding specifics on McAuliffe’s agenda; the Democrat has addressed issues with a broad brush throughout the campaign. It’s fair to ask how McAuliffe would accomplish his objectives and keep his word not to raise taxes. But that doesn’t give Cuccinelli the license to create a platform for his rival. We rate his claim False.	None	Ken Cuccinelli	None	None	None	2013-11-01T13:47:05	2013-10-24	['None']
pomt-08986	"I said no to higher taxes and fees."	mostly false	/florida/statements/2010/jul/15/ellyn-bogdanoff/bogdanoff-said-she-was-against-taxes-omits-votes/	In one of the biggest Republican primary battles in South Florida, two state legislators -- Ellyn Bogdanoff of Fort Lauderdale and Carl Domino of Jupiter -- will face off Aug. 24 to replace Sen. Jeff Atwater, who is running for CFO. To appeal to conservative primary voters, Bogdanoff tries to portray herself in a TV ad as protecting Floridians from higher taxes. Her ad, set against the backdrop of orchestral music and showing images of people struggling to pay bills, emphasizes her role as chair of the Finance and Tax Council -- a position she held for the 2009 and 2010 sessions. Bogdanoff and her husband Steve are seated at what looks like a kitchen table in the ad (it's in a neighbor's home). "The economic downturn has been tough on a lot of people. We've had record job losses and a budget shortfall for state government. As chair of the Finance and Tax Council, the insiders and special interests pushed me to raises taxes. But higher taxes would only make it harder for the people of Florida to sit around their kitchen table and figure out how to make ends meet. I don't represent special interests. I represent the people of Florida so I said no to higher taxes and fees and I will continue that fight in the state Senate." In this Truth-O-Meter item, we explore whether Bogdanoff "said no to higher taxes and fees." The ad is not the first time she has made a similar claim. On her website, Bogdanoff writes: "As Chair of Finance & Tax in the Florida House I have stood against every proposed tax increase. During these challenging economic times, increasing taxes on millions of hard-working Floridians is just simply wrong and is counter–productive to the positive steps we are taking to get the economic engine of Florida moving again." The Truth-O-Meter previously ruled as True a claim by Sen. Charlie Justice, who is running for Congress, that the 2009 Legislature raised taxes and fees by almost $2 billion. A handy spreadsheet from the state Office of Economic and Demographic Research details the laws passed in 2009 that affected state revenue. They include: • $935 million from a $1-per-pack tax increase on cigarettes. • $797 million from sharp fee increases to get a driver's license or new car tags. • $304 million in higher business taxes to replenish Florida's bankrupt unemployment compensation trust fund. • $195 million from fee increases for filing various types of court motions. The bottom-line projection added up to about $2.2 billion in new taxes and fees. We looked at a few of those bills to determine how Bogdanoff voted. • She voted in favor of the conference report for Senate Bill 1778 -- a transportation bill that increased fees for certain title certificates. A bill analysis listed several fees that would increase under the bill related to obtaining crash reports, driver licenses and registrations. • She voted against Bill 1840, the cigarette surcharge tax. • She voted in favor of bill 1718, which raised court fees. • She voted in favor of Bill 810, which made employers subject to higher rates of taxation for unemployment compensation benefits. (The Legislature delayed the increase the next year.) Bogdanoff also voted for the overall budget bill in 2009, which reflected the overall $2.2 billion in new taxes and fees. We sent our findings to Bogdanoff's campaign and asked for an explanation. Bogdanoff called us back directly. She says we can't interpret her ad to mean she never voted for a tax or fee increase -- she doesn't use the word "vote" in her ad. By "I said no," Bogdanoff said, "I mean advocate, said no, stated my position, tried to sway everybody. I'm the one who says no to higher taxes and fees. ... I did not win the battle in 2009. Ultimately I made the decision to vote for a responsible balanced budget." Bogdanoff has made a name for herself as a legislator who fights tax increases, as several news articles show. It's clear that she resisted raising taxes early in the 2009 session. She also made moves to try to prohibit tax increases -- for example, refusing to move forward a bill that would have allowed Miami-Dade residents to vote on a sales tax for Miami-Dade College in 2009. In a Feb. 25, 2009, Miami Herald article about House Republicans being against tax increases, Bogdanoff said: "The average citizen is going to say, 'Don't take money from me, go find it in the budget,' " she said. "I don't care if it's a cigarette tax or a liquor tax, it's still a tax." While the Senate was exploring a range of options including taxes on cigarettes and beer distributors and raising fees to resolve a $3 billion deficit, Bogdanoff resisted, according to a March 26, 2009, Miami Herald/St. Petersburg Times article. "The quick thing to do is just simply raise revenue," Bogdanoff was quoted in that article -- and was paraphrased as saying she would resist as long as it takes, even if that led to an overtime session. "If you come to me and say, 'Do you want to have a longer session or do you want to raise taxes?' I'll take the longer session, " she said. In a May 3, 2009, Miami Herald article, she suggested eliminating property taxes altogether: "What we need to do is . . . start all over again," she said. "If we could figure out how to get rid of property taxes altogether, our economy would be incredibly built." During that session, she repeatedly fought against a cigarette tax and then voted against it. A Dec. 18, 2009, Sun-Sentinel Florida Politics blog stated that Bogdanoff said eliminating the corporate income tax was her top priority because it would make Florida attractive for corporations looking to relocate. A May 2, 2010, profile of her in the Miami Herald stated that during this year's session she successfully negotiated more than $218 million in tax breaks and economic incentives designed to stimulate the Florida economy. In response to the ad, the Sun-Sentinel Florida Politics blog wrote July 13 that Bogdanoff "did send public signals to House leadership in 2009 not to send any of the $2.2 billion in higher taxes and fees through her committee. But she did vote for them on the House floor." That blog best sums up Bogdanoff's actions: She spoke loudly and clearly that she was against making Floridians pay more -- but ultimately she wanted to be a team player and voted for the budget. Bogdanoff defends her ad because she says it doesn't refer to her votes -- it refers to what she "said" in her role as chair of the Finance and Tax Council. We agree that she spoke against tax increases -- but ultimately politicians are judged by their votes. Many observers of her ad could interpret "I said no to higher taxes and fees" to mean that she she voted against them. That critical detail, that she voted for some of them, is left out and leaves a different impression. We rate this claim Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.

pomt-05284	"Obama’s flush with cash, returning to Wall Street for even more money. … Wall Street sure supports President Obama."	mostly false	/florida/statements/2012/may/24/american-future-fund/american-future-fund-wall-street-obama/	President Barack Obama called out "fat cat bankers on Wall Street," but those wealthy bankers sure help him out when he needs campaign donations, says an ad on the air in Florida dubbed "Obama’s Wall Street." It’s from the conservative organization American Future Fund. Here’s the script: Obama: "I did not run for office to be helping out a bunch of fat cat bankers on Wall Street." Narrator: "But guess who gave $42 million to Obama’s last campaign for president: Wall Street bankers and financial insiders, more than any other candidate in history. But Obama voted for the Wall Street bailout. His White House is full of Wall Street executives … ." (The ad then shows photos and lists the names in the White House "inner circle.") The narrator continues: "Now, Obama’s flush with cash, returning to Wall Street for even more money. Obama won’t admit to supporting Wall Street, but Wall Street sure supports President Obama." There are a lot of claims in that ad, and our friends at FactCheck.org have already picked apart the list of 27 officials the ad shows, and whether they really are White House inner circle folks and former Wall Street executives. Many of them aren’t. (FactCheck also wrote that the fund later tweaked the ad.) For our fact-check, we will focus on whether "Wall Street sure supports Obama." The ad’s message is that the president is Wall Street’s favored candidate, and that he is cleaning up in Wall Street donations this cycle, just like he did in 2008. The ad was launched in February, but we've seen it on television in Florida in May. A February press release from the fund stated the $4 million buy covered nine states, including Florida, Ohio and Virginia. We contacted the fund to ask if it had any additional citations beyond what was in the ad and did not get a response. First, some background about the American Future Fund: It states on its website that it advocates "conservative, free market ideals," and its president is an Iowa state senator. Many of the group’s ads target Obama. The New York Times reported that the group was started with seed money from an ethanol executive. The Center for Responsive Politics, which analyzes campaign donations, wrote in 2010 that the American Future Fund received about half of its $23 million from the Center to Protect Patients Rights, a group that gave donations to groups opposed to the federal health care law or abortion. Obama’s vote as a senator and the 2008 campaign The ad is correct when it states that while a senator Obama voted in favor of the Wall Street bailout (H.R. 1424) on Oct. 1, 2008. He was one of 74 senators, along with his Republican presidential opponent John McCain, to vote in favor. The ad then cites fundraising data from the Center for Responsive Politics, a nonpartisan research group which analyzes campaign donations. We looked at CRP’s data ourselves for the 2008 and 2012 presidential races. During the 2008 campaign, Obama raised about $42.8 million from the finance/insurance/real estate industry -- far above McCain’s haul of about $31.1 million. (FactCheck.org wrote that Obama’s haul was more than George W. Bush’s in 2004 even when adjusted for inflation.) The center breaks down that finance/insurance/real estate industry into more detail, including securities and investment, which outreach coordinator Evan Mackinder said would be the most specific way to characterize Wall Street donations. Obama raised about $16 million from the securities and investment industry, while McCain raised about $9.4 million. The ad cites the $42 million figure -- the larger and broader number -- rather than the more specific securities and investment number, but the ad can take some leeway on that point, because it described it as "Wall Street and financial insiders." After Obama became president and pushed for financial reform, his relationship with some in the finance sector soured. We found many news reports documenting that tension. Mitt Romney, the presumptive Republican nominee, founded the investment firm Bain Capital and has had friendly relations with Wall Street and secured millions from those donors. Romney said he would repeal the Dodd-Frank regulations and has been vague about other reforms that he would enact to avoid the 2008 financial meltdown. Obama and Romney donations in the 2012 race Through April, Romney is in the lead in donations from finance/insurance/real estate and, within that, the securities and investment industry, according to a May analysis written by the Center for Responsive Politics. Romney has raised about $19.2 million from the finance/insurance/real estate including about $8.5 million from the securities and investment industry, according to the center’s analysis. Obama has raised about $8.4 million in the finance/insurance/real estate, including about $3 million from securities and investment. That means Romney has raised between double and triple Obama’s haul from the securities and investment sector. If we look at the donations proportionally, it would show that the securities sector funded about 3 percent of Obama’s haul and 10 percent of Romney’s. (This doesn’t provide a full picture since the center’s analysis is for donations that were more than $200 a pop -- in the case of Obama that means about $99 million of his $217 million is reflected in the analysis by industry.) The analysis shows that the securities/investment industry is the second-largest source of donations for Romney, behind the "retired" category. It comes in fifth for Obama, behind retired, lawyers, education and business services. The securities/investment donations are even more lopsided for the super PACs: the Restore Our Future pro-Romney PAC raised about about $21 million from that industry while the Priorities USA Action pro-Obama PAC raised about $218,500. The center wrote in a March blog post that the ad uses its data to make a misleading point when it states that "Wall Street sure supports President Obama": In a separate March 2012 article, the center stated that between his campaign committee and a PAC, Romney had received about 72 percent of the near $33 million in Wall Street donations through February. "The sheer amount of cash Wall Street has sent Romney represents an extremely lopsided giving pattern. No other presidential candidate, including President Barack Obama, comes close to tapping the motherlode of industry riches. The industry's abandonment of Obama could hardly be more dramatic: Wall Street's preferred candidate in the 2008 race with more than $6 million in industry campaign contributions at this point in the cycle, he has received less than $2.6 million from the industry so far this time around." News articles cited in ad The American Future Fund ad flashes headlines or information from a few news articles. But we found the ad cherry-picked a few of its sources. • The ad shows a partial headline from an October 2011 Washington Post story: "Obama still flush with cash from financial sector." The rest of that headline, which was omitted from the ad, stated, "despite frosty relations." The article explains that Obama had raised more from the financial and banking sector than Romney but not when putting aside Democratic National Committee money. • The ad cites the headline from a February 2012 Bloomberg article "Obama returns to NYC for Wall Street fundraiser." That article includes this sentence: "So far this election cycle, he hasn’t been able to match the success he had four years ago in getting money from Wall Street." Our ruling The American Future Fund’s ad says, "Obama’s flush with cash, returning to Wall Street for even more money. … Wall Street sure supports President Obama." It is true that Obama has received millions of dollars from Wall Street this cycle. But the intention of the ad is to suggest that Obama is Wall Street’s preferred candidate, just like in 2008. In reality, the numbers don’t bare that out -- Romney is the preferred candidate, based on both campaign contributions and news coverage.

pomt-13920	Says Ron Johnson referred to "The Lego Movie" as an "insidious anti-business conspiracy."	half-true	/wisconsin/statements/2016/jun/24/russ-feingold/did-ron-johnson-call-lego-movie-anti-business-cons/	It’s not every day a U.S. Senate election includes conspiracy claims over an animated children’s movie and a staffer dispatched to visit an opponent dressed as "Lord Business." It felt like something we should check out. U.S. Sen. Ron Johnson, a Wisconsin Republican, took hits from bloggers in May 2015 after criticizing "The Lego Movie" for pushing an anti-business message. Amid a contentious election that could swing the balance of power in the Senate, challenger Russ Feingold has repeatedly revisited Johnson’s statements, including June 3, 2016, at the state Democratic Party convention in Green Bay. Amid one of many reminders that he had visited all 72 Wisconsin counties, Feingold said this: "Something else I didn’t hear around the state is that, as Sen. Johnson said, that ‘The Lego Movie’ — he said this — that ‘The Lego Movie’ is an insidious, anti-business conspiracy. I didn’t hear that. My grandkids don’t even think that." Did a sitting U.S. senator claim Hollywood is in cahoots with anti-business forces elsewhere to bring their insidious doctrine to the masses? What Johnson said "The Lego Movie" — which was released in February 2014 and brought in almost $500 million worldwide — follows the exploits of an extraordinarily average Lego construction worker named Emmet. The Washington Post described him as "an unthinking worshipper at the consumerist temples that President Business has erected to distract his citizens from Business’ evil plan to freeze them into a state of perfection." In short, President Business — later revealed to be the sinister Lord Business — is trying to glue all the Legos together to keep everything in its proper place, and Emmet and his team of master builders want to maintain freedom and creativity. We eventually learn the plot stems from the imagination of a young boy playing with Legos belonging to his businessman father, who plans to, yes, glue them together to keep everything in its proper place. So what did Johnson say? From March to May 2015 he commented on the movie in various forums including comments to the Eau Claire Leader-Telegram and Wispolitics.com, a small group in Cedarburg and in a since-deleted blog post on his official Senate site. In the various comments, Johnson made multiple references to leftist control of education and the media and repeatedly referred to "The Lego Movie" as anti-business, though not in those direct words. As WisPolitics.com, phrased it in a May 28, 2015, post, Johnson "lamented what he called a ‘cultural attitude’ that ‘government is good and business is bad,’ giving as an example the animated ‘Lego’ movie, in which the villain is called ‘Lord Business.’ "That's done for a reason," Johnson told the site. "They're starting that propaganda, and it's insidious." Johnson noted in his blog post the same day that his comments were inspired by a Wall Street Journal column criticizing the anti-business tone of the movie. So Johnson clearly called the movie ‘insidious’ and implied it was anti-business, but there’s no conspiracy claim. (Merriam-Webster defines a conspiracy as "a secret plan made by two or more people to do something that is harmful or illegal.") When questioned on the "conspiracy" claim, Feingold’s campaign provided a dozen links to stories on Johnson and "The Lego Movie," but no evidence that Johnson had called it a conspiracy. A Feingold spokesman noted only that Johnson mentioned the movie to the Leader-Telegram two days after describing to the U.S. Chamber of Commerce how "the radical left" controls the university system, education system, news media, entertainment media and "more and more of our courts." The coverage of that talk also did not include any more direct reference to a conspiracy. And the conspiracy claim was notably absent when Feingold’s campaign hammered Johnson on "The Lego Movie" several weeks before the Democratic convention speech. The campaign issued a news release May 14 and even sent a press assistant to Johnson’s Milwaukee office dressed as Lord Business, asserting he and Johnson were friends. The character offered to endorse the senator if he supported the Trans-Pacific Partnership, a trade agreement backed by the Obama administration. Is the movie anti-business? As long as we’re on the topic, are Johnson and other commentators right to call the movie anti-business? However you summarize the plot, it is a feature-length piece of product placement, which seems a curious frame for anti-business propaganda. And while being "anti-business" is an opinion, it’s worth noting the creators at least didn’t intend it that way. Philip Lord, who co-wrote and co-directed the movie, described it as an "anti-totalitarian film for children. Something that was talking about the importance of freedom and innovation in keeping society honest." When asked to respond on Twitter to the anti-business claims last year, Lord said: "Art deserves many interpretations, even wrong ones." Our rating Feingold told a hall full of Democrats that his opponent called "The Lego Movie" an "insidious, anti-business conspiracy." Johnson used the word "insidious" to describe the movie on multiple occasions and repeatedly referred to it as anti-business, though not in so many words. But Feingold is wrong on the boldest and most significant part of the claim. A conspiracy implies a specific fact – that some great hidden hand or collusion is at work to indoctrinate the masses. And it’s something Johnson never said.

pomt-08037	"I stopped requesting earmarks in 2008."	true	/texas/statements/2011/jan/05/michael-mccaul/michael-mccaul-says-he-stopped-requesting-earmarks/	In an e-mail newsletter, U.S. Rep. Michael McCaul, R-Austin, celebrated the defeat of an annual spending bill that Senate Republicans refused to support. "Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid tried to pass a proposed omnibus budget bill with 6,714 earmarks worth $8.3 billion, but pulled it after Americans became outraged that Washington is not listening to their cries to stop pork barrel spending," McCaul said in the Dec. 20 e-mail. "I am proud that I stopped requesting earmarks in 2008 until the system becomes 100 percent transparent." Republican lawmakers have lately been swearing off earmarks — funding for local projects that lawmakers slip into spending bills — so we wondered if McCaul's own hands have been pork-free since 2008. First, we turned to databases of earmarks from fiscal 2008 to 2011 created by the nonpartisan Taxpayers for Common Sense, a group that is critical of earmarks. Prior to 2007, when the House tightened disclosure rules, lawmakers weren't required to attach their names to earmark requests. According to the 2008 database, McCaul joined other lawmakers in securing 19 earmarks worth $19.96 million in 2007. Alone, McCaul sponsored five earmarks totaling $1.72 million. He requested $200,000 for the City of Austin and $900,000 for an Imaging Research Center in Austin, among others. But according to the databases and Taxpayers for Common Sense spokesman Steve Ellis, McCaul hasn't requested any earmarks since. Mike Rosen, a spokesman for McCaul, passed along an April 2008 op-ed column by the congressman in which he said he was joining 35 colleagues in not "requesting earmarks until meaningful, common sense reforms are made." The op-ed, published in the Houston Chronicle, suggests that each earmark be brought to the floor and voted on; currently, they're added to legislation and usually passed without debate. In his 2008 op-ed, McCaul noted that while most earmarks "are legitimate, and submitted by politicians who earnestly want to help the largest number of people by finding meaningful and worthwhile requests ... the lack of transparency and accountability in the process have bloated already unprecedented government spending and led to well publicized abuses like the infamous Alaskan 'bridge to nowhere.' In 2005, Alaska's Congressional delegation secured about $230 million to build a bridge to an island of 50 people. In a March press release responding to the Senate's defeat of a proposed earmark moratorium, McCaul reiterated his position, saying he wouldn't request earmarks until it's "100 percent transparent as to the sponsor and recipient and until each earmark is subject to an up and down vote on the House floor." The New York Times reported in December that while some lawmakers have denounced earmarks, they haven't necessarily stopped seeking money for special projects. The Washington-based Citizens Against Government Waste obtained a letter to the Department of Education from Rep. Mark Kirk, R-Ill., asking the agency to release money "needed to support students and educational programs" in a local school district that later said it received about $1 million in stimulus aid, according to the Times. Rosen told us that McCaul "routinely writes letters of support for entities" in his district that are "applying for federal competitive grants." Such agencies include the Department of Justice, Health and Human Services and the Department of Energy, Rosen said in an e-mail, "for projects that range in scope from alternative energy to law enforcement to health and domestic violence programs." "The funding sought is already budgeted by each agency for eligible projects and the grants are awarded based on set criteria established by law," Rosen said. Ellis told us that he wouldn't call that earmarking, because "the agency is still making the decision. When you have an earmark in a piece of legislation, it subverts the agency decision-making process." Upshot: McCaul stopped requesting earmarks in spending bills as of 2008. That's True.

pomt-12801	Says there is a "new law now charging all protesters with terrorism."	pants on fire!	/punditfact/statements/2017/feb/14/blog-posting/fake-news-alert-bloggers-claim-protesters-can-be-l/	The headline on an Internet post claims a recently passed law allows protesters to face terrorism charges, but a closer read shows the post is guilty of misrepresenting the facts. "New law now charging all protesters with terrorism," reads an undated post on a site called RedRockTribune.com. The post says it has been shared more than 363,000 times on Facebook, which flagged the story as part of its efforts to stamp on fake news in its users’ news feeds. The article can be traced back to a Nov. 17, 2016, item on ConservativeDailyPost.com, but it has been shared on several other websites. It says a Republican has a new legal solution for dealing with liberal protesters — a law charging them with "economic terrorism." The headline on the post makes it sound as if a law allowing terrorism charges for protesters is already in place. The body of the post implies the law is on a national scale. That’s not an accurate description of what happened. The headline takes the core of a real event but builds a story full of incorrect details around it. There’s currently no law on the books along these lines. Washington state Sen. Doug Ericksen did suggest a bill criminalizing protests in the way described. The Republican proposed the measure in November, after protests erupted following President Donald Trump’s election. The idea was aimed largely at environmental activists in the Pacific Northwest who looked to shut down commercial and transportation projects in the region. Ericksen said his bill would make protesting a felony were the protest to "block transportation and commerce, cause property damage, threaten jobs and put public safety at risk." There are already legal guidelines in place limiting protests — you can be arrested for harassing people, or blocking walkways, streets or the entrances to buildings, for example. But Ericksen wanted to make the punishments much more severe. The "economic terrorism" charges could be levied against groups that organized such protests. Penalties would have included a $10,000 fine and up to five years in prison. "I respect the right to protest, but when it endangers people’s lives and property, it goes too far," Ericksen said. "Fear, intimidation and vandalism are not a legitimate form of political expression. Those who employ it must be called to account." Ericksen is serving as communications director for the Environmental Protection Agency as part of Trump’s transition team while also keeping his state office, drawing a recall effort from opponents. But at the time the post was written, Ericksen was only proposing a bill penalizing protesters that harshly, and only in his state. That alarmed critics and the state chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union. He did eventually file a bill in the state Senate, but it wasn’t quite as severe as the one he originally suggested. SB 5009 would impose prison terms on protesters who "cause an economic disruption," ranging from 60 days for a misdemeanor and up to a year for a felony. One example to which he referred was of Washington protesters who blocked train tracks to two oil refineries in May 2016. The bill is currently sitting in the state Senate’s Law and Justice Committee. There’s no national law that brands protesters as terrorists. The headline makes a ridiculous leap to misrepresent the actions of a Washington state senator.

pomt-02099	"We were the last flag flying in Benghazi."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2014/may/16/trey-gowdy/trey-gowdy-says-we-were-last-flag-flying-benghazi/	Rep. Trey Gowdy -- the South Carolina Republican tapped by House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, to head the newly established House Select Committee on Benghazi -- has begun sharing some of the questions he plans to investigate. Gowdy’s panel is charged with looking into the Sept. 11, 2012, attack on a U.S. government complex in Benghazi, Libya, that killed four Americans, including Ambassador Chris Stevens. During an appearance on Fox News Sunday on May 11, 2014, host Chris Wallace asked Gowdy, "So, tell me the single biggest question you want to ask" former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. Gowdy responded, "Why were we still in Benghazi? The British ambassador was almost assassinated. Our facility was attacked twice. There were multiple episodes of violence. We were the last flag flying in Benghazi, and I would like to know why." The notion that the United States was "the last flag" in Benghazi has been echoed by other Republican critics of the Obama administration’s actions before, during and after the Benghazi attack. Now, with the head of the Benghazi panel citing it as one of his top investigative priorities, we thought we’d check it out. We quickly found contrary evidence in a report issued by the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence on Jan. 15, 2014. The report stated that "although some countries and international organizations had reduced their presence in Benghazi, the United States maintained a diplomatic presence there similar to the UN, the European Union, and other Western countries such as Italy, France, Turkey, and Malta." The report footnoted this claim to a Dec. 6, 2013, email from the State Department to the Senate committee. "I think the Senate report is a fine source" for this sort of information, said Thomas Joscelyn, a senior fellow at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, a group founded by conservatives and hawkish Democrats. "I doubt the Democrats were in cahoots to lie about this sort of thing. Absent any contrary evidence, I don't see any reason to doubt the Senate report on this." Joscelyn then dug a little further and provided us with some additional evidence. On Jan. 12, 2013 -- four months after the attack on the U.S. complex -- the vehicle of the Italian consul general was attacked by terrorists in Benghazi. No one was injured, but according to the State Department, the attack on the Italian diplomat was carried out by terrorists who "had a role in the 2012 attacks against U.S. facilities." Then, on Oct. 11, 2013, a car bomb in Benghazi caused severe damage to the building housing the joint honorary consulates of Finland and Sweden. There were no injuries or casualties. All told, then, it seems that other nations also had a footprint in Benghazi just before the attack on the United States’ complex, and continued to have one afterward. So where did the notion that "we were the last flag flying in Benghazi" come from? When we checked with Gowdy’s staff, they pointed us to testimony given by Lt. Col. Andrew Wood, who was stationed in Libya as a site security team commander in Libya from February 2012 to August 2012. He testified before the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee when it was investigating the Benghazi attack in October 2012. Wood’s testimony appears to be the source of the vivid phrase "last flag flying in Benghazi." Here’s what he told the committee: "The British consulate moved out when I was there, and they actually had (a memorandum of understanding) with us to leave their weapons and vehicles on our compound there in Benghazi. They would come back and occupy at times, draw their weapons and vehicles, and do their work, and return them and leave. The attack on the International Red Cross was another attack that also involved us and threats to the compound there in Benghazi. The threats were made on Facebook to both the remaining Western influences there in Benghazi, being the Red Cross and the U.S. Embassy compound. The Red Cross was attacked with rocket-propelled grenades in early June. When it was attacked a second time, I believe they made the decision they were going to give up and leave Benghazi. When that occurred, it was apparent to me that we were the last flag flying in Benghazi. We were the last thing on their target list to remove from Benghazi." We reached Wood, who is now back at his job with the federal Bureau of Reclamation in Utah. By phone, Wood said that when he used the phrase "last flag flying in Benghazi," he was specifically referring to the three western institutions mentioned in the threats on Facebook -- the British and United States diplomatic complexes and the Red Cross facility. In other words, Wood didn’t literally mean there was no other western presence in Benghazi -- rather, he was referring to the United States as the last of the three specifically cited targets to be attacked. So by Wood’s account, the United States wasn’t literally the last western entity in Benghazi -- though it was one of the last, operating a higher-profile and more permanent facility than the other nations that remained on the ground. For instance, Wood said he recalls Turkey having a presence in Benghazi -- "Amb. Stevens went to meet with Turkish diplomats there," he said — but he said the Turks tended to put people on the ground periodically and "for a specific reason." France, for its part, would "rent a villa and send their diplomats, then wrap it all up and leave no trace." Wood said that, in his view, the truth lies "somewhere in the middle" between the Senate report (which glosses over the impermanence of some of the western operations in Benghazi) and Gowdy’s claim that the United States was literally the last western entity in the city. Our ruling Gowdy said the United States had "the last flag flying in Benghazi." Some nations, such as the United Kingdom, had abandoned Benghazi or limited their footprint prior to the attack on the United States complex. But like a game of telephone, the meaning of the phrase Gowdy used shifted from its original meaning as politicians embraced it as an evocative talking point. In his testimony, Wood used the phrase more rhetorically than literally, explaining that the United States was the last of three western institutions that had been mentioned in a terrorist threat to be attacked. In fact, there’s clear evidence that several other western nations had a presence in Benghazi immediately before and well after the attack on the U.S. compound. We rate the claim False.

pomt-00186	Says Ohio congressional candidate Danny O’Connor "would make Columbus a sanctuary city for illegal immigrants."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2018/oct/19/defending-main-street/danny-oconnor-wouldnt-and-cant-make-columbus-sanct/	"Sanctuary city" is a term that typically applies when local police won’t cooperate with federal authorities if someone in their custody is suspected of immigration violations. This is a flash point in the national debate over borders and immigration. It’s also apparently a flash point for Republicans in the 2018 Ohio Congressional District 12 election. A new ad from Republican U.S. Rep. Troy Balderson says his opponent, Danny O’Connor, supports progressive values such as sanctuary cities. A Balderson ad in early October said it more directly: O’Connor "supports making Columbus a sanctuary city." And a recent ad from a group called Defending Main Street, a PAC affiliated with the Republican Main Street Partnership, says the same thing: O’Connor "would make Columbus a sanctuary city for illegal immigrants." Would he? Could he? And what’s the proof? The proof, Defending Main Street says, is a tweet from O’Connor in support of a policy from the mayor of Columbus. The tweet said nothing specifically about sanctuary cities. Yet it touched on an issue awfully close, and raised a good question: Does O’Connor really want to make Ohio’s capital city a sanctuary city? The tweet in question Soon after taking office in 2017, President Donald Trump issued a travel ban barring immigrants from certain Muslim-majority countries from entering the United States. He said they posed a national security risk. In turn, Columbus Mayor Andrew J. Ginther issued an executive order on Feb. 3, 2017, for his city. It said that the city supports refugees and will help place or settle those "eligible to be admitted to the United States as refugees." Note the language: "eligible to be admitted." The mayor's order also said the city would not use its resources "for the sole purpose of detecting or apprehending persons based on suspected immigration status, unless in response to a court order." This meant the city was not going to stop or pull people over just to check on their immigration status. Yet as refugee-friendly as this sounds, the mayor's executive order made an important legal distinction: The city would not investigate or cooperate in an investigation "unless a warrant exists, a criminal violation was reported, or an arrest was made." Some cities refuse to do even that -- and those are the very cities the White House defines as sanctuary cities. Ginther announced his intentions to issue this order a few days earlier, with a Jan. 30 news release. The mayor that day wrote a tweet as well: "This week I will issue an executive order that will support the resettlement of refugees in Columbus." The tweet was about supporting resettlement -- legal resettlement, as the executive order made clear. The mayor's tweet said nothing about refusing to cooperate with federal authorities when police have arrested someone -- which the mayor was not saying, anyway. The mayor's tweet on supporting resettlement prompted O’Connor to send a tweet of his own to his followers. It retweeted Ginther’s words and added, "Proud of my friend and Mayor @andrewginter for his leadership in pushing back against Trump. We are all immigrants!" See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com Sanctuary or no O’Connor made no mention of sanctuary cities in his tweet. Defending Main Street says that the mayor's announcement closely mirrors sanctuary city laws and O'Connor's tweet was an endorsement. But it wasn't a clear endorsement of sanctuary city policy. Some definitions are helpful here. The White House website says the term sanctuary city "generally refers to jurisdictions that refuse to cooperate with lawful federal immigration enforcement efforts, often by rejecting immigration ‘detainer’ requests from U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement." Here is how this works, the White House says: When local police arrest "an illegal alien on criminal charges, ICE issues a detainer, which is a request that the local authority notify ICE before releasing the alien and maintain custody for a short time so that ICE may take custody for removal purposes. Sanctuary jurisdictions, including many big cities, refuse to comply with ICE’s detainer requests." Columbus has never declared itself a sanctuary city. It said it wecomes immigrants, but it never said it wouldn’t cooperate with federal immigration authorities. Rather, the mayor's order said the city would do so when "a warrant exists, a criminal violation was reported, or an arrest was made." That is a lot different from cities that have made arrests in crimes but still refuse ICE requests to turn the individuals over for ICE custody. Those cities are more typically labeled — or declare themselves — sanctuary cities. ICE says this as well: It places "detainers on aliens who have been arrested on local criminal charges," so it can determine whether it has probable cause to believe that they are removable from the United States. That phrase -- they have been arrested on local criminal charges -- is the same criterion the mayor used in his executive order. ICE adds on its website, "When law enforcement agencies fail to honor immigration detainers and release serious criminal offenders, it undermines ICE’s ability to protect public safety and carry out its mission." The Center for Immigration Studies, which describes itself as supporting "low immigration" while being "pro-immigrant," has an online map pinpointing sanctuary cities. None are in Ohio. That’s because the center uses "the strictest definition possible," which means cities that refuse or prohibit their agencies from complying with ICE even when someone has been arrested, spokesman Matthew Sussis said. O’Connor’s views As Franklin County recorder, O’Connor has no power to make Columbus a sanctuary city. He wouldn’t if elected to Congress, either. "O'Connor does not support sanctuary cities," his campaign manager, Annie Ellison, told us. As for his views on immigration, O’Connor told Vox that "I don’t support abolishing ICE... Oversimplifying things is not going to solve our immigration problem." In an interview with the Columbus Dispatch in early July, O’Connor said, "What we have right now at the border with the separation of children from their families is abhorrent. If we make sure our immigration debate is focused on safety and not on penalizing folks who aren't committing crimes and are contributing economically, that's the right way to do things." Our ruling Defending Main Street says, as Troy Balderson has also said, that Danny O’Connor "would make Columbus a sanctuary city for illegal immigrants." O’Connor couldn’t if he wanted to, but he also has not said that. He supported policies of the Columbus mayor, who said the city would not volunteer to go after federal immigration suspects or turn them over to ICE "unless a warrant exists, a criminal violation was reported, or an arrest was made." That doesn’t meet the definition of a sanctuary city by ICE or groups that support lower levels of immigration. We rate the claim False.

pomt-08534	Says Wisconsin Attorney General J.B. Van Hollen "knew about (the Ken Kratz sexting) case for nearly a year and did nothing about it."	false	/wisconsin/statements/2010/oct/04/scott-hassett/challenger-scott-hassett-says-attorney-general-jb-/	Prosecutor Ken Kratz has been battered by a storm of denunciation since revelations in September 2010 that he used his position -- and sexually suggestive text messages -- to pursue a crime victim and possibly two other women who relied on him to do right by them in court. Among those castigating the Calumet County district attorney is Scott Hassett, the Democrat candidate for state attorney general. But Hassett’s thunder has also pounded another prosecutor, Attorney General J.B. Van Hollen, his Republican opponent in the Nov. 2 election. It was Van Hollen’s Department of Justice that in October 2009 conducted a criminal investigation of Kratz’s most recent "sexting." Hassett was blunt in a Sept. 21 e-mail to his supporters, declaring: "Van Hollen knew about this case for nearly a year and did nothing about it." Hassett has since been more measured, saying Van Hollen did nothing "substantive." When we asked him to back up his claims, Hassett said Van Hollen should have taken a number of steps, including: Questioning Kratz as part of DOJ’s criminal investigation. Reporting Kratz to the Office of Lawyer Regulation, the state agency that investigates attorney misconduct. Reporting Kratz to Gov. Jim Doyle, who has the power to remove district attorneys from office. Much has happened publicly in recent weeks, so it’s important to keep in mind what was known at the time. Let’s look at Hassett’s accusation in light of how the case unfolded and the role of Van Hollen’s office in it: Criminal investigation The Department of Justice’s involvement was limited to the racy texts sent to Stephanie Van Groll in October 2009 by Kratz, then the chair of the state Crime Victims Rights Board. Kratz had gained attention in 2007 for successfully prosecuting junkyard worker Steven Avery for the murder of a young photographer. Reports about texts to the other two women and a separate woman who says Kratz invited her to an autopsy didn’t surface until after the Associated Press revealed the Van Groll texts on Sept. 15, 2010. Kratz, 50, had met Van Groll, 26, while prosecuting a domestic violence case against her former boyfriend. In one text, he wrote: "You may be the tall, young, hot nymph, but I am the prize." On Oct. 22, 2009, the third day of receiving such text messages, Van Groll reported them to Kaukauna police. Van Groll said Kratz was harassing her and she feared that his interest in her could affect how Kratz prosecuted her former boyfriend, who was accused of strangling her. Van Groll went to police in Kaukauna, in Outagamie County, because she lived there at the time. Kaukauna police turned their investigation over to the state Division of Criminal Investigation because the Police Department often works with the Calumet County district attorney's office. The Justice Department opened its investigation on Oct. 27, 2009. It closed the probe several days later, without questioning Kratz. Van Hollen told PolitiFact Wisconsin "there weren’t any facts that indicated any crimes were committed." Van Hollen, who described himself as being "very involved" in the case, said he didn’t question the decision by investigators who determined it was not necessary to interview Kratz. He noted the department took the step of replacing Kratz in the domestic violence case involving Van Groll with one of its own prosecutors. Office of Lawyer Regulation Even though Van Hollen’s agency decided not to file criminal charges, Van Hollen and other department attorneys may have had an obligation to report Kratz to the state Office of Lawyer Regulation. Wisconsin Supreme Court rules require a lawyer to make such a report if he or she knows another lawyer has committed professional misconduct. The misconduct must raise "a substantial question as to that lawyer's honesty, trustworthiness or fitness as a lawyer." Two days after the Kratz scandal broke in the news, the Wisconsin District Attorneys Association’s executive committee -- which includes a Department of Justice official -- called on Kratz to resign his district attorney post. The committee judged his behavior with Van Groll as repugnant and "inconsistent with the standards of our profession." That would seem to qualify as professional misconduct that the Department of Justice should have reported to the Office of Lawyer Regulation as it was reviewing the case for possible charges. Van Hollen’s office did not to report Kratz to the regulatory office -- but it did pressure him into reporting himself. On Nov. 12, 2009, less than two weeks after the criminal investigation was closed, Department of Justice attorney Kevin Potter told Kratz in an e-mail "we believe the matter needs to be reported to OLR. Again, we would be willing to discuss with you what we see as being your options and what we believe to be the best course of conduct for you to follow." Three weeks after that, on Dec. 4, 2009, Kratz reported his texts to Van Groll to the Office of Lawyer Regulation. It could be argued that a complaint filed the Department of Justice would carry significant weight with OLR. But Van Hollen said his office believed that cases that are self-reported were more likely to result in disciplinary action. The Department of Justice also pressured Kratz in an e-mail to resign from the state Crime Victims Rights Board, which investigates complaints of public agencies or officials accused of violating the rights of crime victims. About a month later, on Dec. 3, 2009, Kratz stepped down. Ultimately, the Office of Lawyer Regulation did an initial review and told Van Groll on March 5, 2010, it would not conduct a formal investigation of Kratz. The letter said his texting, while inappropriate, "did not appear to involve possible professional misconduct." Since the news surfaced about the other women surfaced, however, OLR said it would open an investigation of Kratz. Gov. Jim Doyle After the news broke about Kratz’s texts to Van Groll and the woman who said he invited her to an autopsy, Doyle used a state law that allows a governor to remove a district attorney from office to launch a process for deciding whether Kratz should be removed. The law allows the governor to oust a DA "for cause," which is defined as "inefficiency, neglect of duty, official misconduct, or malfeasance in office." Van Hollen said it wasn’t necessary to inform Doyle because the Office of Lawyer Regulation’s purpose is to investigate lawyer misconduct. He pointed out that while Doyle could remove Kratz as district attorney, OLR action could potentially result in Kratz being barred from practicing law altogether. OK. We’re ready to make a closing argument. In his bid for attorney general, Democrat Scott Hassett accused Republican incumbent J.B. Van Hollen of doing nothing for nearly a year after his office learned that Calumet County District Attorney Ken Kratz had sent sexually suggestive text messages to a crime victim. Van Hollen’s office reviewed the case for possible criminal charges, but found no grounds for any. Van Hollen could have reported Kratz directly to the Office of Lawyer Regulation, but his office instead pressured Kratz himself to do so, feeling that would make the case even stronger. They also pressured him to resign from the Crime Victims Rights Board. They could have reported the text matter to Gov. Jim Doyle, but Van Hollen felt the review panel was in the best position to determine if Kratz committed professional misconduct. Hassett argues Van Hollen could have done more. But his statement was that Van Hollen did nothing. Our verdict: Hassett’s statement is False.

pomt-12942	Activities by foreign governments had "absolutely no effect on the outcome of this election."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2017/jan/08/donald-trump/donald-trumps-dubious-claim-foreign-governments-ha/	On Jan. 6, President-elect Donald Trump was briefed on the U.S. intelligence community’s probe into allegations of Russian influence in the 2016 presidential election, including possible connections to electronic hacks and public releases of private communications by senior Democrats. A declassified version of the report found that "Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered an influence campaign in 2016 aimed at the U.S. presidential election. Russia’s goals were to undermine public faith in the U.S. democratic process, denigrate (Trump’s opponent, Hillary) Clinton, and harm her electability and potential presidency." Following the intelligence briefing, Trump’s office released a statement. After noting the "constructive meeting" and the "tremendous respect" he had for their work, Trump stated: While Russia, China, other countries, outside groups and people are consistently trying to break through the cyber infrastructure of our governmental institutions, businesses and organizations including the Democrat (sic) National Committee, there was absolutely no effect on the outcome of the election including the fact that there was no tampering whatsoever with voting machines. There were attempts to hack the Republican National Committee, but the RNC had strong hacking defenses and the hackers were unsuccessful. The phrase that caught our eye was, "there was absolutely no effect on the outcome of the election." That's a pretty definitive statement. And Trump echoed this argument in a Jan. 7 tweet: "Intelligence stated very strongly there was absolutely no evidence that hacking affected the election results. Voting machines not touched!" However, the argument that there was no impact of any kind on the election outcome is not backed up by the intelligence community’s report. The report specifically stated it didn’t look at that question. Here’s what the report actually said: We did not make an assessment of the impact that Russian activities had on the outcome of the 2016 election. The U.S. Intelligence Community is charged with monitoring and assessing the intentions, capabilities, and actions of foreign actors; it does not analyze U.S. political processes or U.S. public opinion. So if the Trump campaign is using the intelligence community report to back up its assertion that there was no Russian influence on the outcome, it's doing so without justification. When we contacted the Trump transition media office, we did not receive a response. Here’s our review of the publicly available evidence. Ballot counts The Trump camp has a point on one issue: Despite some concern among security experts going into the election that Russia might hack into state and local vote-counting systems and tamper with the tallies, the intelligence community report found that any such efforts by Russia were not successful in changing any votes. The report says that while "Russian intelligence obtained and maintained access to elements of multiple U.S. state or local electoral boards," the Department of Homeland Security "assesses that the types of systems Russian actors targeted or compromised were not involved in vote tallying." Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., the ranking Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, conceded this in an interview with the PBS NewsHour on Jan. 6. "It is true there is no evidence that the tampering with voter machines or tampering with voter registrations or any of like that affected the counting of the votes. That's true," Schiff told PBS’ Judy Woodruff. Some observers might be concerned that Russia did manage to breach at least some election authorities’ computer networks, and they might also be concerned that Russia and Putin, according to the report, tried to influence the election, even if it’s less clear whether they succeeded. Still, Trump has a point that Russia didn’t literally change actual votes electronically. Ballot tampering vs. other types of Russian influence Members of the Trump camp have portrayed the report’s clean bill of health on the question of Russian ballot-tampering as proof that Russia had no impact at all on the election. For instance, on the Jan. 8 edition of CNN’s State of the Union, incoming White House counselor Kellyanne Conway told Jake Tapper that "if you read the full report, they make very clear, (Director of National Intelligence James) Clapper in his testimony (to the Senate Armed Services Committee) made very clear on Thursday under oath that that any attempt, any aspiration to influence our elections failed. They were not successful in doing that." On Fox News Sunday, incoming White House chief of staff Reince Priebus echoed Conway’s invocation of Clapper’s testimony, saying Clapper had testified to the Senate panel "that there is no evidence in the report that any of this changed the outcome of the election." Neither assertion is accurate. First, to equate a lack of ballot tampering with a lack of any Russian influence on the election conflates two things that are not the same. Conway and Priebus essentially defined ballot-rigging as the only way an election can be influenced, when in reality the intelligence report primarily addresses other ways Russia tried to influence the election. The Russian effort blended, in the report’s words, "covert intelligence operations — such as cyber activity — with overt efforts by Russian Government agencies, state-funded media, third-party intermediaries, and paid social media users or ‘trolls.’ " And second, Clapper in his testimony never said that "any attempt, any aspiration to influence our elections failed" (as Conway put it) or that "there is no evidence in the report that any of this changed the outcome of the election" (as Priebus put it). Clapper’s most direct remark at the Senate hearing on this issue came in this exchange with the panel’s chairman, Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz.: McCain: "So really, what we're talking about, is if they succeeded in changing the results of an election, of which none of us believe they were, that would have to constitute an attack on the United States of America because of the effects, if they had succeeded, would you agree with that?" Clapper: "First, we cannot say -- they did not change any vote tallies or -- or anything of that sort." McCain: "Yeah, I'm just talking about…" Clapper: "And we have no -- we have no way of gauging the impact that -- certainly the intelligence community can't gauge the impact it had on the choices the electorate made. There's no way for us to gauge that." Subsequently in the hearing, Clapper arguably went even further in a response to questioning by Sen. Angus King, I-Maine. King, referring to his work with Baltic states that have been grappling with Russian influence in elections for several years, said, "The best defense is for our public to know what's going on, so they can take it with a grain of salt. … That's why I think public hearings like this and the public discussion of this issue is so important, because we're not going to be able to prevent this all together. But we need to have our people understand that when they're being manipulated. Would you agree with that conclusion?" Clapper responded, "Absolutely. That's why I feel so strongly about the statement in October," referencing his own statement during the campaign that the Russian government had been engaged in efforts "intended to interfere with the U.S. election process." How credible is the argument that Russia influenced the election in some fashion? Schiff is one of many Democratic officials who personally believe that other types of Russian efforts may have had an impact on an election that ultimately hinged on fewer than 100,000 votes cumulatively in three states -- Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. In his PBS interview, Schiff specifically referred to the hacking and release to websites such as WikiLeaks of personal emails written and received by Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta and other top Democrats -- releases that Trump prominently featured during the campaign. "The daily dumping of information that was damaging to Secretary Clinton and helpful to Donald Trump was hugely consequential," Schiff said. But is it possible to move beyond a gut feeling and prove that Russia influenced enough voters to change the election’s outcome? Not really, say political scientists. A campaign as large-scale as a presidential race is buffeted by so many factors that it’s essentially impossible to know for sure that any given factor played a role in determining who won. "The presidential election, with its national constituency, is decided by multiple, interrelated causes, all of which were necessary but not sufficient," said Kyle Saunders, a Colorado State University political scientist. Referring to such factors as the candidates’ personalities and messages as well as the general political environment, Saunders said that "no one determinate cause can be offered as ‘the’ explanation, and doing so is a fool's errand." Saunders agreed that one doesn’t have to believe that hacking did affect the election to say comfortably that Trump is wrong to say it absolutely didn’t affect the election -- there's simply no way of knowing either way with any certainty that something affected the outcome. He added that while a reasonable case can be made that the hacking did help Trump, that's informed speculation -- not certainty -- and said there’s no way to know how big a factor it may have been compared to other factors. "It is difficult to argue that the barrage of damaging information released almost exclusively about Clinton and Democrats did no harm or did not create an atmosphere in which voters questioned her judgment or credibility or dampen support for her candidacy," said Costas Panagopoulos, a Fordham University political scientist. That said, Panagopoulos added, "in truth, there is no way to know with certainty what the causal impact of Russian involvement was on the outcome of the 2016 election." Our ruling After meeting with senior intelligence officials about the details of a soon-to-be-released report on alleged Russian hacking, Trump said that activities by foreign governments had "absolutely no effect on the outcome of this election." Trump can use the intelligence report to bolster this assertion only in one limited way -- that Russia did not succeed in tampering with vote counts (though it appears to have tried). On the broader issue of whether Russia had any impact on the outcome of the election, the report specifically noted that it didn’t address this issue, and Clapper in his Senate testimony didn’t either. Saying there was no Russian ballot-tampering is not the same thing as saying there was no Russian influence on the election. Political scientists say it’s impossible to move beyond informed speculation about whether there was a Russian impact on the election’s outcome -- or, importantly, whether there wasn’t an impact. Trump’s formulation, echoed by later statements by those in his camp, offers a definitive, broad-brush conclusion that isn’t proven by the evidence, and really can’t be.

pomt-12272	"The president in no way, form or fashion has ever promoted or encouraged violence."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2017/jul/05/sarah-huckabee-sanders/has-donald-trump-never-promoted-or-encouraged-viol/	Has President Donald Trump promoted violence? At a White House briefing, White House spokeswoman Sarah Huckabee Sanders answered with a definitive no. During a June 29, 2017, press briefing, CBS News’ Major Garrett asked Huckabee Sanders about some of Trump’s recent tweets, including a pair directed at "low I.Q. Crazy Mika" and "Psycho Joe" -- the hosts of MSNBC’s Morning Joe. Trump mocked Mika Brzezinski by tweeting that she had been "bleeding badly from a face-lift" during a visit to Mar-a-Lago. Garrett said that "some have suggested" that Trump’s tweets have "misconstrued one of the messages that should have been gathered" after the shooting of House Majority Whip Steve Scalise, R-La., and several others at a congressional baseball practice. "Do you have any reaction to that sentiment, that conversations like this create an atmosphere that is either dangerous or one we need to avoid?" Garrett asked. Huckabee Sanders responded, "The president in no way, form or fashion has ever promoted or encouraged violence. If anything, quite the contrary. And he was simply pushing back and defending himself." We’re not considering Trump’s tweet of a GIF showing him body-slamming a figure labeled CNN at a professional wrestling match, which Trump sent several days after Huckabee Sanders’ comment. However, the record shows at least one clear case and possibly several others in which Trump has said things that we believe an ordinary listener would understand as encouraging violence. (The White House declined to comment on the record.) The clearest example In February 2016, during his campaign for president, Trump told a crowd in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, "So I got a little notice. We have wonderful security guys. It said, ‘Mr. Trump, there may be somebody with tomatoes in the audience.’ So if you see somebody getting ready to throw a tomato, knock the crap out of them, would you? Seriously. Just knock the hell .... I promise you, I will pay for the legal fees. I promise. I promise." As a review of the video shows, Trump is not smiling or chuckling as if this was intended as a joke. Other examples of Trump speaking favorably of violence On several other occasions, Trump invoked violence without necessarily inciting it. (Hat tips to the Washington Post’s Aaron Blake and Mashable for collecting a number of these in one place.) • August 2015. At a press conference in Michigan, Trump contrasted his interactions with the public with those of Democratic candidate Bernie Sanders, who had recently faced opposition from Black Lives Matter protesters. "That will never happen with me," said Trump, according to a dispatch by the Washington Post’s David Weigel. "I don't know if I'll do the fighting myself, or if other people will. It was a disgrace. I felt badly for him, but it showed that he was weak. You know what? He's getting the biggest crowds, and we're getting the biggest crowds. We're the ones getting the crowds. But that's never going to happen to Trump." • November 2015. At a rally in Alabama, Trump said about a protester, "Get him the hell out of here, will you, please? Get him out of here. Throw him out!" The following day, calling into Fox News, Trump responded to a question about allegations that the protester had been "roughed up." The protester, Trump said, had been "so obnoxious and so loud ... maybe he should have been roughed up. Maybe he should have been roughed up. Because it was totally disgusting what he was doing." • February 2016. At a rally in Las Vegas, Trump again responded to a protester: "See, he’s smiling. See, he’s having a good time. Oh, I love the old days, you know? You know what I hate? There's a guy, totally disruptive, throwing punches. We're not allowed to punch back anymore. I love the old days, you know what they used to do to guys like that when they were in a place like this? They'd be carried out in a stretcher, folks. Oh, it's true. … The guards are very gentle with him. He’s walking out with big high-fives, smiling, laughing. I’d like to punch him in the face, I’ll tell you," • March 2016. At one point at a rally in Michigan, Trump reiterated his pledge to pay legal fees for people who remove protesters. "Get him out," Trump said. "Try not to hurt him. If you do, I'll defend you in court, don't worry about it." (Trump later said he had never made the pledge to pay legal fees.) • March 2016. At an event in Palm Beach, Fla., Trump referred to a past incident with protesters. "We have had a couple that were really violent, and the particular one when I said I'd like to bang him, that was a very  —  he was a guy who was swinging, very loud and then started swinging at the audience and the audience swung back, and I thought it was very, very appropriate. He was swinging, he was hitting people, and the audience hit back, and that’s what we need a little bit more of." • March 2016. At a rally in North Carolina, Trump said, "In the good old days this doesn't happen because they used to treat them very, very rough. And when they protested once, they would not do it again so easily. But today they walk in and they put their hand up and they put the wrong finger in the air at everybody. And they get away with murder, because we’ve become weak." • March 2016. At a rally in St. Louis, Trump once again addressed protesters who were being removed from the facility. "Part of the problem and part of the reason it takes so long (to remove the protesters) is nobody wants to hurt each other anymore, right? And they're being politically correct the way they take them out. So it takes a little bit longer. And honestly, protesters they realize it -- they realize there are no consequences to protesting anymore. There used to be consequences. There are none anymore." • March 2016. At a rally in Kansas City, talking about someone who had rushed the stage, Trump said, "I don't know if I would have done well, but I would have been out there fighting, folks. I don't know if I'd have done well, but I would've been — boom, boom, boom. I'll beat the crap out of you." The legal question Trump’s words have, on occasion, drawn lawsuits. However, an attorney for the American Civil Liberties Union has written skeptically about whether Trump’s words would qualify legally as incitement to violence. "There is no question that Trump’s decision to use his bully pulpit to actually bully protesters and to rile up his crowds against them is morally despicable," wrote Lee Rowland, a senior staff attorney with the free-speech group wrote concerning a lawsuit stemming from a Trump rally in Louisville. "But legally, deciding whether what happened in that crowded theater rises to the level of incitement is a trickier task." Rowland wrote that "incitement charges have been used to jail anti-war protestors, labor picketers, Communists, and civil rights activists. Over time, the Supreme Court learned from these mistakes and adopted a very speech-protective test to determine when incitement has taken place. In Brandenburg vs. Ohio, the court ruled that the First Amendment permits liability for incitement only when speech is intended and likely to cause imminent and serious lawlessness. It’s a high bar for a reason, and Trump’s conduct at the rally didn’t meet it." Our ruling Huckabee Sanders said, "The president in no way, form or fashion has ever promoted or encouraged violence." We found one example -- when Trump said, "If you see somebody getting ready to throw a tomato, knock the crap out of them, would you?" -- that clearly fits the criteria of promoting or encouraging violence. This was not an isolated incident; we found at least seven other examples in which Trump offered public musings that showed a tolerance for, and sometimes even a favorable disposition toward, physical violence. Trump’s words may not meet a legal threshold for incitement to violence, but Huckabee Sanders’ portrayal seriously distorts the record of Trump’s past statements. We rate her statement False.

pomt-07434	China holds 26 percent of the U.S. debt.	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/apr/22/herman-cain/herman-cain-says-china-holds-26-percent-us-debt/	Here's one thing many Republicans and Democrats agree on: concern about the amount of our debt held by China. The issue has been raised recently by President Barack Obama and seemingly every Democratic and Republican leader. It's been a key talking point for possible GOP candidate Donald Trump. So how much of the U.S. debt, exactly, does China hold? In a speech at a tea party event in Iowa on April 16, 2011, potential Republican presidential candidate Herman Cain said it's 26 percent. "If we don't begin to grow with the potential that we have in this country, we will have another national security crisis, and that national security crisis is that China will be as big as we are," Cain said. "They'll start to develop a military as big and as good as ours and they've got a billion more people and they're holding 26 percent of our debt. And you think we're going to be able to sing Kumbaya with them?" We e-mailed a spokeswoman at Friends of Herman Cain to substantiate the figure and did not hear back, but it appears Cain was referring to a U.S. Treasury report on the major foreign holders of treasury security. According to the report, as of February of this year, China held $1.15 trillion worth of U.S. treasury securities. Together, all foreign holders came to $4.47 trillion. So China's share of that comes to about 26 percent. China, incidentally, tops the list of foreign holders of U.S. debt, followed by Japan and then, with a much smaller share, countries such as the United Kingdom and Brazil. But that's just the foreign holders of treasury securities. More than two-thirds of the debt is held by U.S. residents and institutions. When you look at everyone who holds U.S. treasury security, China's share drops to 8.1 percent ($1.15 trillion out of $14 trillion). Of course, there are lots of ways to slice debt statistics. For example, instead of gross federal debt (the figure cited above), some people prefer to use a figure for "debt held by the public." That's the gross federal debt minus the share of the debt held by the U.S. government itself. That was $9.4 trillion at the end of 2010. Which would put the portion held by China at about 12.3 percent. There are also Chinese holdings of debt outside of Treasuries, said Derek Scissors of the conservative Heritage Foundation. But that doesn't get Cain anywhere near his 26 percent figure. "Even stretching, you can't get past 15.6 percent of our debt as held by China and I would not use that number," Scissors said. The number cited by Cain is "misleadingly large," Scissors said. "He's not talking about our debt, he's talking about the foreign share of our debt. If you are going to use that number, you really have to explain it." In other words, Cain should have dropped in some qualifiers to make his statement accurate. For example, he could have said "among the foreign holders of U.S. debt, China ranks first and holds 26 percent." But he didn't. Cain said simply that China "is holding 26 percent of our debt." There are a couple ways to consider debt, but using the two most common, Cain is either off by more than double or more than triple. We rate Cain's statement False.

pomt-03017	Chris Christie "has not increased the taxes on anyone."	half-true	/new-jersey/statements/2013/oct/13/kim-guadagno/kim-guadagno-claims-chris-christie-hasnt-raised-ta/	New Jersey has plenty of reason to re-elect Chris Christie next month, according to Kim Guadagno, his lieutenant governor. In addition to sticking to his principles, Christie, a Republican, has been a strong steward of residents’ money during his time as governor, Guadago said to supporters Monday in Carlstadt. Guadagno was filling in for Christie, who had to cancel his appearance at the last minute. "He has not increased taxes on anyone," the lieutenant governor told the crowd. Christie also has made this claim a few times, but the Truth-O-Meter’s stance on it remains the same from the first time we fact-checked it: the consequences of some of Christie’s budget-cutting actions have resulted in tax increases for some New Jerseyans. And PolitiFact New Jersey isn’t the only fact-checking group to say so. Our truth-seeking colleagues at FactCheck.org, a project of the Annenberg Public Policy Center of the University of Pennsylvania, have called the governor out for claiming not to have raised taxes. Let’s start with some background on how New Jersey generates tax revenue. The state’s three biggest revenue generators are the gross income, sales and corporation business taxes, none of which have increased since Christie took office on Jan. 19, 2010. So Guadagno is correct that the governor has not actually raised any of those taxes. But other actions by the governor cut tax relief for those who relied on support from programs such as the Earned Income Tax Credit and other credits. In the eyes of some experts that means certain New Jerseyans had less money to pay their taxes, and the impact of the cuts was essentially a tax increase for those residents. The EITC is a credit given certain residents who work and have earned income. It reduces the amount of New Jersey tax owed and may result in a refund, even if those eligible for the credit owe the state no taxes, according to the state Treasury Department. Treasury Department spokesman Bill Quinn has said that in many cases, the EITC represented a subsidy to low-income people, and more than three-quarters of New Jerseyans who received the credit in 2010 actually owed the state no tax. Still, New Jersey cut the EITC during Christie’s first year in office. Christie also cut spending for two property tax relief programs, one of which -- now known as the Homestead Benefit program -- more than halved the average rebate that exceeded $1,000. Although state Treasury Department officials have argued that tax credit programs are payments from the state and reductions in credits do not represent tax increases, some experts disagree. Dennis J. Ventry, Jr., a professor at University of California Davis School of Law, previously told PolitiFact New Jersey that a reduction in a tax credit is "absolutely a tax increase," while Richard Pomp, a professor of law at the University of Connecticut and state taxation expert has said, "To someone who has had a benefit cut that is less money they have to spend," whether you call it a tax increase or a spending cut. Joseph Henchman, vice president of legal and state projects at the Tax Foundation, a business-backed group, has said it would be a mistake to equate reductions in tax credits as tax increases or spending cuts. "They have elements of both and are strictly neither," Henchman said. Kevin Roberts, spokesman for Christie's gubernatorial campaign, said previous administration comments on this topic stand. "There have been no tax increases under this Governor," he said in an e-mail. Our ruling Guadagno said about Christie in a speech to supporters in Carlstadt, ""He has not increased the taxes on anyone." It’s true that the governor has not increased the rate of taxation for New Jersey’s three biggest revenue generators: the gross income, business and sales taxes. But it’s also true that he has cut tax credit programs that resulted in some New Jerseyans having less money to pay their tax bills. In the eyes of some experts, that’s still a tax increase.

pomt-10193	"In January, I outlined a plan to help revive our faltering economy, which formed the basis for a bipartisan stimulus package that passed the Congress."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/sep/18/barack-obama/congress-didnt-pass-obamas-economic-plan/	With global financial markets shaken by the credit crisis, Barack Obama is promoting his ability to devise solutions for a troubled economy. In a Sept. 16 speech in Golden, Colo., Obama took credit for inspiring the economic stimulus package that Congress enacted and President Bush signed in February, saying its components had roots in an economic plan he outlined a month earlier on the campaign trail. "In January, I outlined a plan to help revive our faltering economy, which formed the basis for a bipartisan stimulus package that passed the Congress," Obama said. He went on to criticize his GOP opponent, John McCain, for promoting corporate tax breaks at the same time. The stimulus package was Congress’ attempt to promote consumer spending and revive the flagging economy through a combination of tax rebates, business tax incentives and housing provisions worth a total of $124.5-billion through the end of fiscal 2018. Despite most lawmakers’ initial optimism, recent signs are it hasn’t achieved its intended effect; August housing starts hit a 17-year low and credit rating agencies are forecasting weak holiday sales this winter. But can Obama really take credit for having "formed the basis" of the plan? He did articulate some policy proposals that found their way into the package, but he was far from the only politician promoting ways to prime the economy. And in many cases, he was endorsing ideas that already had been raised by others. The economic stimulus plan began life on Jan. 11, when House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., and Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., sent President Bush a letter asking him to help hammer out a bipartisan package to shore up the economy. By enlisting White House involvement, Pelosi and Reid hoped to pre-empt a possible avalanche of competing proposals to address the nation's economic problems. Bush endorsed the idea on Jan. 17, and the next day delivered an economic address calling for tax rebates for individuals and tax breaks for businesses to deliver "a shot in the arm" to the faltering economy. Obama announced his plan in a news release on Jan. 13. The backbone of Obama’s plan was tax relief for working-class Americans and senior citizens. He called for an immediate $250 tax cut for workers and their families and a $250 bonus for seniors, to be delivered in their Social Security checks. He advocated further cuts if the economy continued to worsen. And he backed expanding unemployment insurance and providing relief to homeowners hit by the housing crisis. Congress decided to go much further on the question of rebates. The final package incorporated a House-written stimulus plan that directed $600 payments to individuals who paid taxes in 2007 on wages or investment income, and $1,200 for couples. The payments would phase out beginning with individuals who made more than $75,000 in adjusted gross income and couples with more than $150,000. But anyone qualifying for a check would receive an additional $300 for each dependent child under age 17. It should be noted that the practice of providing tax breaks in tough times is not exactly new, meaning no one in the current Congress can claim credit for thinking up the idea. President Bush’s 2001 tax cuts, for example, sent rebates of $300 for individuals and $600 for married couples filing jointly in the hopes of stimulating the economy, though the payments in that instance were called "advance refunds." Obama’s call for expanded unemployment insurance never made it into the stimulus package, though Democratic leaders included an extension of the program in a supplemental war spending bill that Congress cleared in June. The provision, which gained traction after the nation’s jobless rate recorded its biggest jump in 20 years, extended unemployment insurance in all states by 13 weeks beyond the 26 weeks already authorized under law. States with unemployment rates of 6 percent or higher got an additional 13 weeks. So while Obama might have broached the idea, it took dire news from the Bureau of Labor Statistics to prod Congress into taking action. Obama’s somewhat vague call for relief to distressed homeowners also was not included in the stimulus package. However, similar, more detailed plans had floated around Congress for nearly a year, as the depth and intensity of the mortgage crisis became apparent. Lawmakers including Senate Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs Committee Chairman Christopher J. Dodd of Connecticut — a former Democratic presidential candidate — and House Financial Services Committee Chairman Barney Frank, D-Mass., discussed ways of averting more foreclosures as early as March 2007, including creating public-private "rescue funds" that ease the way for borrowers to rewrite the terms of their mortgages. These discussions eventually led to provisions in a mortgage relief bill that Congress enacted and President Bush signed on July 30 that established a temporary government program to help borrowers who can’t afford current mortgage payments avoid foreclosure. The program, called HOPE for Homeowners, reinsures mortgages between Oct. 1, 2008 and Sept. 30, 2011, thereby making the government liable if the borrower defaults on the new loan and if the amount received in foreclosure is less than the outstanding principal. The costs of the program will be paid for by funds diverted from mortgage giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. As to Obama's claim that his economic plan "formed the basis" for the package that became law, we see lots to dispute that. Congress had its own ideas about the size of tax rebates to individuals and didn’t adopt Obama’s ideas about unemployment insurance or homeowner relief. What’s more, lawmakers on committees with jurisdiction over the housing market discussed more detailed plans for helping homeowners months before Obama articulated them. Obama clearly deserves credit for offering a plan to bolster the sagging economy before Congress acted. But he is exaggerating the role his plan played in the stimulus package, which was jointly constructed with congressional leaders and the White House. For these reasons, we judge his claim Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.

pomt-11564	"We invested" in our transportation system "$24 billion over eight years. That’s $3 billion more than what former Governor Jim Doyle spent on transportation over the same period of time."	mostly false	/wisconsin/statements/2018/feb/06/scott-walker/why-scott-walker-real-terms-has-spent-less-transpo/	In his Jan. 24, 2018, State of the State speech, something of a launching pad for his run for a third term as governor, Republican Scott Walker drew contrasts between himself and his predecessor, Democrat Jim Doyle. Despite criticism for not spending more on transportation, Walker nevertheless claimed he’s done better than Doyle, stating: "We invested" in our transportation system "$24 billion over eight years. That’s $3 billion more than what former Governor Jim Doyle spent on transportation over the same period of time." Walker has made the same claim for at least 11 months, on Twitter, in a weekly radio address, in media interviews and in public appearances. The numbers The nonpartisan Legislative Fiscal Bureau told us it’s possible to reach Walker’s figures by considering the total raw dollars put toward transportation programs, including a double-count of the principal in terms of money borrowed. That is, Walker’s method counts the principal at the time money was borrowed, and counts it again when repayments are made on that debt. That method shows Walker’s eight years of DOT funding, in raw dollars, including bonding and subsequent debt service payments, at $25.8 billion -- $3.4 billion more than Doyle. But besides doing the double counting, that measure also fails to take into account inflation. So, it is problematic in two ways. Here are the fiscal bureau numbers without the double counting but including inflation: Governor Period Real DOT funding Difference Jim Doyle 2003-’11 $18.7 billion +$1.3 billion Scott Walker 2011-’19 $17.4 billion Those figures show that Doyle, in real dollars, spent more on transportation than Walker has. We ran into a similar issue when Walker said in February 2017 the state is "investing more money into education than ever before in the history of Wisconsin." Our rating was Mostly False, since it didn’t take into account inflation, which is the best way to measure amounts over time. Our rating Walker says "we invested" in our transportation system "$24 billion over eight years. That’s $3 billion more than what former Governor Jim Doyle spent on transportation over the same period of time." Walker’s claim uses raw dollars and counts the total amount of bonding, debt service and all funds put toward transportation. But that double-counts the principal and ignores inflation. Excluding the double counting and taking into account inflation -- that is, real dollars spent on transportation -- Doyle actually spent more in his eight years than Walker has in his. We rate Walker’s statement Mostly False. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com More on Walker and transportation Road project progress: In December 2017, Walker said: "Road projects across the state are staying on track or getting done sooner thanks to the good work of the team at the Wisconsin Department of Transportation." Our rating: Mostly False. He pointed to one highway project being ahead of schedule. But a wide range of other projects -- including major ones -- have been delayed. Promises kept: In November 2017, we rated as a Promise Kept two pledges that Walker made during his 2014 campaign for a second term as governor. He repaid funds that had been raided from the state transportation fund, and he prevented any more raids from the funding from occurring.

pomt-00207	Says Detroit-area law enforcement is searching for a 'vigilante' serial killer after three pedophiles were killed in one week	pants on fire!	/facebook-fact-checks/statements/2018/oct/16/blog-posting/no-pedophiles-outside-detroit-are-not-being-target/	A story claiming that a vigilante is killing pedophiles outside of Detroit includes gruesome details about the murders of three men accused of sexually assaulting children. But according to the Macomb County Sheriff’s Office, the article is "completely FAKE NEWS." Published Sept. 30 on nbc9news.com—a website that features an "NBC 9 News" banner— the article is headlined, "Macomb County Fears ‘Vigilante’ Serial Killer After Third Pedophile Found Murdered in 1 Week." This story was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) As it turns out, what Macomb County residents actually feared was that this story was real: The Macomb County Sheriff’s Office announced on Facebook that several people reached out to ask the agency about the story after it appeared in their News Feeds. On Oct. 1, the sheriff’s office posted a message refuting the allegations. "The Macomb County Sheriff’s Office has not had any recent murders involving any registered sex offenders and our residents have no reason to be fearful of a killer on the loose," the agency’s statement reads. Three days earlier, on Sept. 28, a nearly identical story about a serial killer appeared on a website called cbs15.com. "Longview, TX Authorities Fear ‘Vigilante’ Serial Killer After Third Pedophile Found Dead In A Week," the headline reads. As in Michigan, the supposed first victim in Longview was "a 52-year-old man charged with sex offences [sic] against children as young as 5." The Longview Police Department also derided the article as "fake news." "There is no truth or validity that our sources can find that the author or the supposed news affiliate exists," reads a statement that the department posted on its own Facebook page on Sept. 28. Clicking on the byline for both stories leads to contact pages for the purported news sites. "We’d love to hear from you," the pages read, "please use the form below for any general enquiries." Messages sent to both the NBC 9 News and the CBS 15 News websites were not answered. Reached by phone, Eric Ehrler, a detective sergeant with the Macomb County sheriff's office, said the story is false. "Don't know where it came from, and there's no information that it is accurate at all," he said. The NBC News affiliate in Detroit, WDIV Local 4, responded to the false headline by writing its own story on the hoax: "There are several NBC affiliates throughout the country that broadcast on a virtual channel 9," writes Brian Newland in an article on WDIV’s website, "but none of them appear to be associated with nbc9news.com."

pomt-13792	Says Hillary Clinton is proposing "destroying Medicare for seniors."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/jul/19/donald-trump-jr/donald-trump-jr-wrong-hillary-clinton-proposing-de/	Speaking at the Republican National Convention in Cleveland, Donald Trump Jr. touted his father, the newly anointed GOP presidential nominee, as someone who would be able to do a better job on health care than his rival, Hillary Clinton. He said his father would be "a president who will repeal and replace Obamacare without leaving our most vulnerable citizens without health care, and who will do it without destroying Medicare for seniors, as Hillary Clinton has proposed." Given how popular the single-payer health care program for seniors is, it was pretty obvious to us that Clinton wouldn’t have put the proposal "destroy Medicare" on the issues page of her website. (We were right on that one.) Still, we wondered whether there is any plausible interpretation of her actual Medicare policy proposals in which they could end up "destroying Medicare for seniors." We didn’t hear back from the Trump campaign about what Donald Trump Jr. meant, but we took a look for ourselves. First, let’s review Clinton’s agenda for Medicare. On her issues page, the word "Medicare" comes up twice. First, Clinton said she would "explore cost-effective ways to make more health care providers eligible for telehealth reimbursement under Medicare and other programs." That’s a fairly limited program, as well as relatively non-controversial and unlikely -- even in a worst-case scenario -- to endanger the program’s future, said Sherry Glied, a health policy specialist at New York University’s Robert F. Wagner Graduate School of Public Service. The second reference to Medicare on Clinton’s issue page is more sweeping -- to "support letting people over 55 years old buy into Medicare." Currently, you need to be 65 to get coverage under Medicare. Under Clinton’s proposal, people up to 10 years younger than that could sign up for the program if they wanted to. Health care experts told PolitiFact that this proposal comes with challenges, but that even if worst came to worst, the idea seems unlikely to jeopardize the program’s continued existence for its core membership of those 65 and older. "There have been lots of proposals of this type in past and not much concern about the effects on traditional Medicare, assuming premiums are set correctly," Glied said. She said the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office last analyzed a proposal of this sort in December 2008 and "raised no concerns about effects on the program as a whole." A. Bowen Garrett, a senior fellow at the Urban Institute’s health policy center, agreed that the eventual fine print in Clinton’s proposal is going to matter, because in any program that’s optional, there’s a risk that it could attract a relatively small and less healthy pool of beneficiaries who could force premiums upward. Still, Garrett said, "I do not see why that would necessarily harm the program" in the way Donald Trump Jr. meant it. Indeed, in the fight to craft the Democratic platform, Clinton’s allies managed to defeat a more sweeping proposal backed by Bernie Sanders to cover all Americans through a Medicare-style single-payer system. After the proposal was defeated, several experts -- including some who are sympathetic to the idea of expanding health insurance coverage -- told Kaiser Health News that the Sanders approach that Clinton defeated was disruptive enough to have actually put the program at risk. "It’s hard to be nimble" when a system gets that big, Ezekiel Emanuel, who advised Obama on crafting his signature health care law, told the publication. "No organization in the world does anything for 300 million people and does it efficiently." Princeton University health policy expert Paul Starr, a onetime adviser to President Bill Clinton, concurred that "to try to do it in one fell swoop would be massively disruptive," according to Kaiser Health News. Other health care specialists told PolitiFact that Donald Trump Jr.’s statement is vastly overheated. "There is nothing in her proposals that would destroy Medicare or harm present or future beneficiaries," said John Rother, the president and CEO of the National Coalition on Health Care and the former executive vice president for policy at AARP -- the seniors’ group that would presumably be at most direct risk if Medicare collapsed. Clinton is urging "changes, yes, quite a few. But nothing that would harm the program or those it serves." Rena M. Conti, a health policy specialist at the University of Chicago, agreed. "Nothing I am aware her saying to date would imply that she aims to dismantle the current Medicare program or take away benefits that seniors currently enjoy or bankrupt the trust fund that is used to finance some current Medicare benefits for seniors," she said. Our ruling Donald Trump Jr. said Clinton is proposing "destroying Medicare for seniors." Clinton is certainly not proposing that in a literal sense, and experts we contacted agreed that her actual policy proposals -- especially making Medicare an option for those between 55 and 65 -- were ambitious but were hardly a dagger at the heart of the program.

pomt-14748	"One of the things I would immediately do … is bring back the warrior class -- Petraeus, McChrystal, Mattis, Keane, Flynn. ... Every one was retired early because they told President Obama things that he didn’t want to hear."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/dec/16/carly-fiorina/carly-fiorina-claims-military-generals-retired-ear/	The Republican candidates divided their time during the CNN Las Vegas presidential debate criticizing each other and criticizing President Barack Obama. Former Hewlett Packard CEO Carly Fiorina combined both in her answer to how she would defeat ISIS. "To wage war, we need a commander in chief who has made tough calls in tough times and stood up to be held accountable over and over, not first-term senators who've never made an executive decision in their life," Fiorina said. "One of the things I would immediately do, in addition to defeating them here at home, is bring back the warrior class -- Petraeus, McChrystal, Mattis, Keane, Flynn. Every single one of these generals I know. Every one was retired early because they told President Obama things that he didn't want to hear." That is an interesting list of military leaders. We looked into their reasons for leaving. Fiorina might have a point for some of them, but certainly two of her examples don’t hold up. Gen. John Keane In a military career that spanned 37 years, Keane rose to become acting chief of staff and vice chief of staff of the U.S. Army. The trouble for Fiorina is Keane resigned in 2003. Obama took office in 2009. Keane never served under Obama. Gen. David Petraeus Petraeus was appointed by President George W. Bush to lead the multinational forces in Iraq. He became chief of the military’s Central Command in 2007 and was appointed by Obama to be commander of U.S. and NATO forces in Afghanistan. Obama nominated Petraeus to head the Central Intelligence Agency in 2011. Petraeus retired from the military to take on the new position. Petraeus was forced to resign from the CIA in 2012 when investigators uncovered that he had shared classified materials with a woman who was writing his biography, and in fact was having an extramarital affair with her. Gen. Stanley McChrystal McChrystal was Obama’s pick to lead American and NATO forces in Afghanistan at a time when the war was taking a mounting toll on U.S. soldiers. McChrystal advocated for a strategy that called for as many as 40,000 additional troops. Many in the White House disagreed, among them Vice President Joe Biden. Ultimately, McChrystal got much of what he recommended. His downfall came when he allowed a Rolling Stone reporter to travel with him. When the article emerged, McChrystal and his staff were quoted making disparaging remarks about Biden and other top civilian administration officials. Such a public rift between top military and civilian officials created a management crisis in the White House. Obama removed McChrystal from his post. In Rose Garden remarks, the president said "the conduct represented in the recently published article does not meet the standard that should be set by a commanding general." McChrystal’s story partly follows Fiorina’s narrative. He did disagree with some of Obama’s top advisers. On the other hand, Obama largely did what McChrystal wanted. We can’t know the complete inside story, but the immediate issue that cost McChrystal his job wasn’t that he spoke up, but that he spoke too publicly. Gen. James Mattis Mattis was part of the command shuffle that took place after Obama fired McChrystal. Petraeus, who had been the head of Central Command moved over to run operations in Afghanistan. Obama put Mattis in charge of Central Command. Obama removed Mattis from that job in 2013. By some reports, there was concern in the White House that Mattis seemed too eager to use military force against Iran. But another account has it that he rubbed civilian officials the wrong way with the issues he raised about Iran. While we don’t know all the details, it seems possible that Mattis was removed over policy differences. Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn Flynn was a key intelligence adviser to McChrystal in Afghanistan and Iraq. In 2012, he became the head of the Pentagon’s Defense Intelligence Agency. According to the Washington Post, Flynn wanted to reorganize the agency, placing more operatives overseas and focusing on a range of threats beyond the conflict zones of Iraq and Afghanistan. His management style and strategic plans put him at odds with his bosses, importantly, Undersecretary of Defense for Intelligence Michael Vickers. Flynn and his deputy left the agency at the same time. Flynn’s story largely aligns with Fiorina’s message. Our ruling Fiorina said that five generals -- Petraeus, McChrystal, Mattis, Keane, and Flynn -- resigned because they all told Obama things he didn’t want to hear. Fiorina might be pushing the point of whether Obama himself didn’t like what they had to say, but two of the men -- Mattis and Flynn -- likely departed over policy differences, published reporting shows. McChrystal’s story is harder to judge because Obama took his advice. There was friction over policy, but he was removed from his post due to an interview with Rolling Stone that at the very least put Obama in a difficult position. Petraeus’ departure had nothing to do with policy. He mishandled classified documents and had an affair. Keane retired long before Obama took office. Fiorina is on solid ground with only two of her examples, and also indicated an Obama involvement that is not proven. That’s shaky enough to rate this claim Mostly False.

pomt-10714	Obama says his health care plan is "universal."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2007/nov/26/barack-obama/no-mandate-makes-universal-claim-tough/	Barack Obama responded to an attack on his health care plan from Hillary Clinton by saying, "I do provide universal health care. The only difference between Senator Clinton's health care plan and mine is that she thinks the problem for people without health care is that nobody has mandated -- forced -- them to get health care." The distinction between the two plan's is that Clinton's has a mandate requiring people to get health insurance; Obama's does not. Is it fair to say a plan is universal without a mandate? There's little doubt that Obama's plan would significantly expand health care coverage. In its structure, it's not that different from Clinton's: Both leave in place employer-based private insurance; they increase access to Medicaid and SCHIP programsl they subsidize premiums for some employers; and they create pools for individuals to buy their own cheaper insurance. But universal? Obama's plan "would get close to universal coverage," said Sara Collins, a health care expert with The Commonwealth Fund. "It's clear his goal is universal coverage," she said, noting that Obama's plan includes a mandate for children. "But I think to get all people covered, he would have to mandate that adults get it, too." We think Obama is pushing the envelope calling a plan without a mandate "universal." For that reason, we rate his claim Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.

pomt-13704	Says Hillary Clinton "negotiated the first agreement — ever — where China and India officially committed to reduce their emissions."	half-true	/global-news/statements/2016/jul/28/bill-clinton/fact-checking-bill-clinton-hillarys-big-climate-ch/	In detailing their much-scrutinized marriage and love story at the Democratic National Convention, former President Bill Clinton also took care to list his wife’s numerous legislative and foreign policy achievements. Among them: "She put climate change at the center of our foreign policy. She negotiated the first agreement ever — ever — where China and India officially committed to reduce their emissions." While Bill Clinton’s claim is largely accurate, he’s offering a rosy spin on the Copenhagen Accord of 2009, which was at the time and continues to be widely panned. Hillary Clinton did play a key -- but not solo -- role in the talks with China and India, and it was the first time the two countries made emissions reduction pledges in an international agreement. But unlike the Kyoto Protocol of 1997 or Paris Agreement of 2015, the accord wasn’t actually an official agreement. It wasn’t "adopted" by signatories, but merely "taken note of" (in other words, they formally recognized the accord’s existence). Furthermore, the "agreement" was non-binding and the countries set their own voluntary targets, leading some environmentalists and experts to cast it aside as essentially meaningless. Let’s dive in. Before Copenhagen, China and India had both signed and ratified the Kyoto Protocol, which the United States backed out of. But because they were developing countries, they were not required to curb their carbon emissions. In 2007, in response to overtaking the United States as the world’s biggest carbon emitter, China released its first national climate change program and said it would reduce its energy consumption by 20 percent by 2010 and "consequently reduce CO2 emissions." Similarly, India released a national action plan on climate change in 2008, in which it didn’t commit to reducing emissions but laid out steps that would. But it wasn’t until Copenhagen that the two countries finally committed to reducing carbon emissions. In this sense, the accord "played a major role in breaking" the "firewall" between developed countries and developing countries when it came to climate action responsibility, according to David Ciplet, an environmental studies professor at the University of Colorado Boulder who wrote Power in a Warming World: The New Global Politics of Climate Change and the Remaking of Environmental Inequality. "However, whether the Copenhagen Accord was a positive development overall is definitely controversial," Ciplet told PolitiFact. Nonetheless, like her husband, Hillary Clinton often touts the accord as one of her major climate change accomplishments, referring to it as a "key diplomatic breakthrough" on her campaign website and recounting how she and Obama were "hunting down the Chinese" to get them to the table. She devotes a significant chunk of a chapter in her 2014 memoir, Hard Choices, to the talks. She notes the role of Todd Stern, a key negotiator, as well as her and Obama’s famous tag-team chase to find the Chinese Prime Minister Wen Jiaobao during the talks. "In a makeshift conference room whose glass walls had been covered by drapes for privacy against prying eyes, we found Wen wedged around a long table with Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, and South African President Jacob Zuma. Jaws dropped when they saw us. 'Are you ready?' said President Obama, flashing a big grin," Clinton writes. "Now the real negotiations could begin. It was a moment that was at least a year in the making." But according to news reports, world leaders, environmental activists and experts, the "real negotiations" didn’t actually lead to anything with teeth. China and India did end up agreeing to reduce their emissions and set their own targets, but emphasized the pledge was not legally binding. This basically changed the international approach to climate action from Kyoto Protocol, which had a compliance mechanism, to "a voluntary approach where countries are free to determine unilaterally what forms of action they would like to commit to," said Ciplet. "Many, including myself, saw this as a much weaker mitigation framework than a robust second commitment period to the Kyoto Protocol," he said, adding that even after the Paris Agreement, "we are still not on track" in mitigating climate change. Our ruling Bill Clinton said Hillary Clinton "negotiated the first agreement — ever — where China and India officially committed to reduce their emissions." Clinton was at the table at the Copenhagen Accord, though she wasn’t the only U.S. official present. And while it was the first time China and India made pledges in an international agreement, their pledges were not legally binding. Many, if not most, environmentalists and experts say the agreement was a wash at best and a failure at worst.

pomt-08512	Daniel Webster "is an advocate for a group that teaches that mothers should not work outside the home."	mostly false	/florida/statements/2010/oct/06/alan-grayson/follow-taliban-dan-ad-alan-grayson-slams-daniel-we/	Rep. Alan Grayson, D-Fla., one of the most outspoken Democrats in the House, garnered attention -- much of it negative -- for a stinging ad he released on Sept. 25, 2010, labeling his Republican challenger, former state House Speaker Daniel Webster, "Taliban Dan" due to his longstanding connection to a conservative Christian group. PolitiFact Florida ruled one part of the ad False and another part Half True. In fact, the national and local attention became so intense that Webster experienced a surge in fundraising among voters who thought that Grayson's attack had gone too far. On Oct. 6, 2010, the Grayson camp released a new ad that covers much of the same territory, but which eliminates some of the more provocative language and claims from the first ad. (In what may be a sign that the Grayson campaign is distancing itself from the "Taliban Dan" ad, the YouTube link to it has now been made inaccessible to the general public.) As soon as we heard about the new ad, we knew we had to fact-check it. So we'll analyze several claims from the ad separately. Here's a full transcript of the new ad: Daniel Webster's Washington backers are attacking Alan Grayson on women's issues. The facts on Webster's record: Fact: Webster sponsored a bill to create a form of marriage that would trap women in abusive relationships. Fact: Webster is an advocate for a group that teaches that mothers should not work outside the home. Fact: Webster would force victims of rape and incest to bear their attacker's child. Those are the facts. Don't let Daniel Webster make the laws we will have to live with. The one we'll check now is the claim that "Webster is an advocate for a group that teaches that mothers should not work outside the home." As we noted in our fact-check of the earlier "Taliban Dan" ad, the Grayson campaign is referring to a conservative Christian group called the Institute in Basic Life Principles. Webster has been involved with the group for nearly 30 years and continues to participate in training sessions and speak at seminars. In a 2003 interview with the St. Petersburg Times, Webster said he home-schooled his six children using the institute's curricula and said that the group's teachings have had a major influence on his life. Since that 2003 article, Webster has kept up his ties to the group -- in fact, the allegation from the "Taliban Dan" ad that we rated False stems from an address Webster made to the group in 2009. So we have no quarrel with Grayson's description of Webster as someone who continues to be "an advocate" for the group. What about the notion that the institute "teaches that mothers should not work outside the home"? We see strong indications that that's the case, but we'll also mention some notable caveats. As we reported in our earlier analysis, the institute helps teach Christians how to find success by following scriptural principles, and some of its specific teachings are controversial. The institute teaches that married couples are to abstain from sex 40 days after the birth of a son, 80 days after the birth of a daughter and the evening prior to worship, and that people should avoid rock and even contemporary Christian music because it can be addictive. In web-based instructional materials titled, "How a Wife’s Attitudes Can Preserve Her Marriage: Seven Key Areas of Respect and Submission," the institute writes, "The specific roles of husbands and wives are defined in Scripture: 'Let every one of you in particular so love his wife even as himself; and the wife see that she reverence her husband' (Ephesians 5:33). A wife who respects her husband’s leadership and submits to him greatly strengthens the marriage relationship." Among other things, the institute's materials tell wives, "Do not threaten your husband or make demands," and they warn that "if you lack inward Godliness and outward neatness and modesty, your husband can lose respect for you and be more easily tempted by other women." We looked through the institute's website and found hints that the group doesn't expect mothers to work outside the home, but we couldn't find an explicit teaching on that point. For instance, the institute teaches, "Trust God to provide for your family’s financial needs through your husband’s leadership." It also teaches wives to "maintain personal neatness in your appearance. Wear your clothes and hair in a way that honors your husband’s preferences. As an expression of how important your husband is to you, do your best to look nice when he comes home from work." The implicit assumption in that teaching is that the man will be working outside the home and the woman will be taking care of the children. And a 1997 St. Petersburg Times profile of Webster quoted the Rev. Tom Brandon, identified as an institute director, saying that it would not be natural for a woman to work outside the home and the man to raise the children. "That puts a wife in a role that she's not equipped for inwardly or outwardly and puts the man in the same position," he said. "A man is the lover and leader. (The wife's) role is to trust God to supply her needs through the leadership of her husband and to serve with him and fulfill his needs." Brandon's quote gets us closer to confirming Grayson's claim, but it's still focused on the idea of house-husband, which muddies the message a bit. So while the view that mothers shouldn't work seems consistent with the institute's teachings, we can't find anything in the institute's materials explicitly requiring mothers to forgo work in order to stay home. But we perceive a more important omission in Grayson's ad -- it ignores substantial evidence that Webster has not adhered to this particular tenet, at least in his official duties. For starters, he has employed numerous working mothers in his office. A Webster spokeswoman said that he employed at least three as senior aides in the legislature: Ann Drawdy, his chief legislative assistant in the House and Senate; Allison Carter, a policy analyst during his tenure as Senate Majority Leader; and MaryPat Moore, his health care policy director during his tenure as speaker. The spokeswoman added that Webster currently has working mothers on his congressional campaign staff. In addition, colleagues in both parties have said that Webster has not sought to push his religious beliefs on them. The 2003 Times profile quoted two of them -- former Democratic House Speaker Peter Wallace and state Sen. Nancy Argenziano, a moderate Republican who served with Webster in the House. "He's a very religious man, but he never imposed that on anybody," Argenziano said. "If he had a personal agenda for his personal beliefs, he never made it the will of he House, so to speak. He was the best speaker I've seen." So where does this leave us? An institute director and some of the teaching materials give strong hints that mothers are expected to be at home, but we don't find anything explicitly requiring mothers to forgo work in order to stay home. But even if that is the group's belief, Webster has employed several mothers in senior positions, and colleagues have said he didn't push his beliefs in the Legislature. That contradicts the impression given in the ad that Webster is personally opposed to mothers working outside the home. So we rate the ad's claim Barely True.

pomt-06054	"Since the passage of Obama's stimulus package, over 1 million additional jobs were lost and nearly 25 million Americans are out of work, are stuck in part-time work, or have given up looking."	half-true	/florida/statements/2012/jan/11/mitt-romney/romney-says-obamas-stimulus-package-over-1-million/	Presidential candidates are zeroing in on job growth with just weeks to go before Florida's Jan. 31 primary. The state has suffered double-digit unemployment since May 2009. In a campaign brochure sent to voters in early January, Republican candidate Mitt Romney attacked President Barack Obama's fiscal policies as the "failed job-killing policies of government spending, regulation and Obamacare." The mailer then criticizes the $787 billion stimulus package that "promised jobs and relief to small businesses but failed to deliver." "What did all that spending do for our economy, families and small businesses?" the mailer asks. "Since the passage of Obama's stimulus package, over 1 million additional jobs were lost and nearly 25 million Americans are out of work, are stuck in part-time work, or have given up looking." Romney, the former governor of Massachusetts, implies that if you've gotten the pink slip since the stimulus package passed, or are stuck in a part-time job, you should feel free to blame Obama. Are Romney's numbers right and is it fair for him to blame Obama? Romney's numbers We turned to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, or BLS, to check Romney's numbers about job losses and unemployment. Obama signed the American Reinvestment and Recovery Act, known as the stimulus, in February 2009. We aren't certain of the exact date of the Romney flier -- the Miami Herald's Naked Politics blog posted it Jan. 6 -- but we believe it relied on November 2011 data. (We did not hear back from Romney's press office when we asked about it.) • Jobs lost: In February 2009 there were about 132.8 million jobs in the United States. In November 2011 there were 131.7 million jobs. That means that there was a job loss of about 1.1 million -- or as Romney claimed "over 1 million." Romney combines three categories for the remainder of his claim -- saying that nearly 25 million are out of work, are stuck in part-time work, or have given up looking. Let's look at each one individually: • Out of work: 13.3 million were unemployed in November 2011. • Stuck in part-time work: BLS has a category called "part-time for economic reasons" which was about 8.5 million in November 2011. • Given up looking: BLS economist Jim Walker pointed us to the categories of "marginally attached" workers -- those who want a job and searched in the past year but not in the past four weeks. That figure was about 2.6 million in November 2011. If we add out of work, stuck in part-time work and given up looking this brings our total to about 24.4 million -- or as Romney said, "nearly 25 million." Is Obama to blame? Now that we've dispatched with the numbers, which are accurate, what about Romney's suggestion here that Obama is to blame or as Romney wrote on the mailer "Obama isn't working"? This report from the White House's Council of Economic Advisers, released in July, estimates the Recovery Act "raised employment by 2.4 to 3.6 million jobs relative to what it otherwise would have been." Don't trust White House advisers to evaluate the president's policies? It's not just their handiwork. The March report cited four independent analyses by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office and three by private economic analysis companies, IHS/Global Insight, Macroeconomic Advisers and Moody's Economy.com. Estimates ranged from 1.3 million to 2.45 million jobs created or saved. (We reviewed this evidence before in our December 2011 fact-check of Florida Republican Rep. Steve Southerland.) In November, the Congressional Budget Office reviewed economic data related to the stimulus and concluded that in the third quarter of 2011, Recovery Act policies: • Raised real gross domestic product by between 0.3 percent and 1.9 percent. • Lowered the unemployment rate by between 0.2 percentage points and 1.3 percentage points. • Increased the number of people employed by between 0.4 million and 2.4 million. • Increased the number of full-time-equivalent jobs by 0.5 million to 3.3 million. Gary Burtless, an economist with the Brookings Institution and an economist for the U.S. Department of Labor 1979-81, says that Romney's statement could cause listeners to incorrectly infer that Obama's stimulus package caused 1.1 million in lost jobs. "Gov. Romney probably recognizes that most of the job losses in 2009 would have occurred, even if Romney himself had taken the oath of office on Jan. 20. (Recall that he was a candidate for the Republican nomination.) Even with all the powers of the U.S. presidency it’s hard to stop a serious recession on a dime," Burtless said. "Many economists, including me, think the job loss would have been considerably greater and the recovery of payroll jobs weaker without the stimulus." Our ruling Romney said: "Since the passage of Obama's stimulus package, over 1 million additional jobs were lost and nearly 25 million Americans are out of work, are stuck in part-time work, or have given up looking." Romney's numbers about job losses and unemployment are correct. But Romney's suggestion that Obama's stimulus is to blame is misleading. Economists both inside and outside the government say the stimulus helped prevent further job losses. We rate this Half True.

pomt-01579	Virginia Democrats recently enforced voter ID rules that were "considerably more stringent than those contained in the state law they denounce."	half-true	/virginia/statements/2014/sep/09/mark-obenshain/obenshain-says-democrats-exceeded-voter-id-law-rec/	Democrats have portrayed state Sen. Mark Obenshain as the face of voter suppression since the Harrisonburg Republican began his successful push in 2013 for a law requiring Virginians to produce photo identification at the polls. Obenshain recently threw paint back at his adversaries in the wake of the Aug. 9 firehouse primary Democrats held for the state Senate seat that was relinquished by Henry Marsh, D-Richmond. In his Aug. 13 newsletter, Obenshain wrote, "In the Democratic Party-run firehouse primary to choose the party’s state senate nominee in the 16th District special election, Democrats -- free to adopt any voter identification standard they wished, or none at all -- opted for requirements considerably more stringent than those contained in the state law they denounce, actually going so far as to require that IDs show the address at which the individual is registered." We wondered whether Democrats did adopt voter ID rules for the contest that were tougher than state law standards. State voter ID law Obenshain’s bill passed on partisan votes in the House and Senate last year and was signed by then-Gov. Bob McDonnell, a Republican. Democrats and many liberal-leaning organizations opposed the measure, saying Virginia had no history of election fraud and voicing concerns that the law would make it harder for the elderly, poor and minorities to vote. Republicans said their aim was not to deny access to ballots, but to protect the integrity of Virginia’s elections. The law, which went into effect July 1, requires voters to produce one piece of identification at the polls: a photo ID. Acceptable forms of the photo identification include a Virginia driver’s license that has not been expired for more than 12 months; a U.S. passport or any other photo ID issued by the U.S., Virginia or one of its political subdivisions; a student ID issued by any institute of higher learning in Virginia; any employee identification card; or a voter ID card that can be obtained through local registrar’s offices. It should be noted that the law does not require the photo ID to include the voter’s address. Poll workers are required to check the ID against voter rolls to make sure the person is registered to vote in the precinct and, if so, is allowed to cast a ballot. ID in the 16th District A firehouse primary is not a typical election; it’s an informal caucus run by a political party, which establishes the rules. On Aug. 9, Democrats opened two caucus sites in Richmond and each of five other localities in the 16th District. Registered voters could drop by between 10 a.m. and 3 p.m. and -- provided they first signed an allegiance oath to the Democratic Party -- cast a paper ballot for one of four candidates seeking the Senate nomination. Robert Dempsey, executive director of the Democratic Party of Virginia, sent PolitiFact the rules for the special election primary. They required each voter to provide proof of registration or residency. The procedures did not demand a photo ID and Dempsey said the party was willing to accept some forms of identification that had once been acceptable in state-run elections, such as a utility bill. Obenshain contends Democrats went beyond the bounds of state law by requiring voters to produce two IDs. Dempsey said that did occur briefly at one polling station, the result of a misunderstanding by officials, and was quickly corrected. Dempsey noted, accurately, that written procedures did not call for two forms of IDs. Obenshain also says Democrats exceeded state law requiring voters to produce an ID bearing their current address. There’s no dispute here. Dempsey said officials checked the address against the one listed in voting rolls. If there was a discrepancy, the voter was allowed to cast a provisional ballot. About 3,800 votes were cast in the four-candidate firehouse primary, including 156 provisional ballots that were never counted because they wouldn’t have made a difference in outcome; Del. Rosalyn Dance of Petersburg won hands down. The district is heavily Democratic, and Dance will have an edge this fall in a race against independent Preston Brown. Our ruling Obenshain claims that the Democratic Party enforced voter ID rules in the 16th Senate District firehouse primary that were "considerably more stringent" than those mandated in a new state law. There was a temporary glitch at one polling place that required voters to produce two IDs, instead of just one mandated under state law. This was quickly corrected and didn’t reflect the party’s intent. That brings us down to the one ID that most primary voters had to produce. Democrats went one step beyond state law by requiring an ID with an address and another step by making sure the address matched with the one listed in voter rolls before a ballot was handed out. On the other hand, the party gets points for leniency because it did not enforce a state law requiring voters to produce a photo ID. So Obenshain’s statement is partially accurate but leaves out a lot of important information. We rate it Half True.	None	Mark Obenshain	None	None	None	2014-09-09T09:23:49	2014-08-13	['None']
pomt-08958	By 12th grade, "more than 3 out of 10 girls have been pregnant at least once."	half-true	/georgia/statements/2010/jul/22/georgia-association-homes-and-services-children/group-says-more-3-out-10-girls-have-been-pregnant-/	Among the many dismal claims PolitiFact Georgia runs across, this one seemed more depressing than most. An e-mail newsletter sent by a membership group of state foster homes and other child services said that by 12th grade, "more than 3 out of 10 girls have been pregnant at least once." Really? That much? Normer Adams, executive director of the Georgia Association of Homes and Services for Children, is editor of Welfare Watch. The newsletter used the teen pregnancy statistic to illustrate the need for programs and praise the Georgia Campaign for Adolescent Pregnancy Prevention's (G-CAPP) Second Chance Homes, where teen mothers live as they learn to be self-sufficient. Here's what the newsletter said: "By the 12th grade, 63% of all students have had sex and more than 3 out of 10 girls have been pregnant at least once." This item deals with the pregnancy statistic. Adams said he got his information from the Web site of G-CAPP, which is a major statewide nonprofit that advocates to lower teen pregnancy rates. G-CAPP's "Fast Facts" page gives a list of statistics on the state of teen pregnancy in Georgia and nationally. "Three in ten girls in the U.S. become pregnant at least once before age 20," it states. That's not by twelfth grade, but by age 20. So the newsletter didn't accurately cite the figure. Still, "three in ten" in the U.S. seemed like a lot, so we called the National Campaign to Prevent Teen and Unplanned Pregnancy, a nonprofit that produces statistics and other information frequently used by teen pregnancy prevention groups. It's where G-CAPP got its figures. The group calculated the pregnancy statistic itself, said Bill Albert, its chief program officer. An April 2008 fact sheet on the statistic said it was based on 2004 teen pregnancy rates from the National Center for Health Statistics, the most recent figures at the time. The usual teen pregnancy rate measures the rate of teen pregnancy in a single year. The figure from the National Campaign to Prevent Teen and Unplanned Pregnancy is different because it measures the "cumulative risk of teen pregnancy over a teen girl's entire life up to age 20," according to its fact sheet. The group totaled the teen pregnancy rate for girls in each of those 10 years, adjusting for teens who have multiple pregnancies. It found that 29.81 percent of girls become pregnant at least once as a teen, or three in 10. To get an independent take on the subject, we contacted the Guttmacher Institute, a nonprofit group that performs social science research, policy analysis and public education on sexual and reproductive health in the U.S. and internationally. It checked data from the National Survey of Family Growth that was released last month. The survey, a sample of 15- to 44-year-olds across the nation, was conducted between 2006 and 2008 by the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Just under 28 percent of women who were age 20 at the time of the survey reported having ever been pregnant, according to the data. That's very close to 29.81 percent from the National Campaign to Prevent Teen and Unplanned Pregnancy. Or three in 10. And for girls who are 18, the typical age for a 12th-grader, that figure was about 17 percent, according to that same set of data. So why don't we notice more of these pregnant teens? Albert from the National Campaign to Prevent Teen and Unplanned Pregnancy said only about half of these teens give birth. "Some may have hidden the pregnancies, some may have elected to terminate the pregnancy, others may have suffered a fetal loss," Albert said. "In short, pregnancy is -- up to a point -- hard to detect. Children are not." So yes, three in 10 females in the U.S. become pregnant at least once by age 20. This means that while Welfare Watch got the statistic from the G-CAPP Web site wrong, it's correct that a significant percentage of U.S. teens become pregnant. So while the statement is generally true, it was off-target on some important information. We rate the statement Half True.

pomt-14727	Says he faced "a record budget deficit" in Virginia in 2014.	false	/virginia/statements/2015/dec/21/terry-mcauliffe/mcauliffes-misspoken-claim-about-facing-record-def/	It’s a set part of Gov. Terry McAuliffe’s spiel to talk about how he "inherited a $2.4 billion deficit" when he took office in January 2014 and managed, with the bipartisan help of legislators, to balance the state budget. In a recent PolitiFact, we checked McAuliffe’s claim that the shortfall was left behind by his predecessor, Republican Bob McDonnell. We noted that McDonnell proposed a balanced budget before leaving office and records show that the brunt of the economic slowdown that caused the shortfall, although not McAuliffe’s fault, occurred during his watch. We rated that claim Mostly False. The governor added a new element to the claim on Dec. 10 during his monthly radio show on WRVA in Richmond. "I came in with a record deficit I inherited," said McAuliffe, a Democrat. Without rehashing details of the "inherited" part of his statement, we decided to examine McAuliffe’s claim that the $2.4 billion shortfall he confronted was "a record deficit" for Virginia. Records show the state faced a far greater crisis at the start of 2010, when McDonnell was succeeding Democrat Tim Kaine as governor and Virginia began suffering the full effects of the Great Recession. Two reports by the General Assembly’s budget committees at that time identified a shortfall of almost $4.5 billion for the two-year budget that would begin July 1, 2010. Brian Coy, McAuliffe’s director of communications, told us the governor "misspoke" in claiming he faced a deficit record. The reason for the mistake requires a little explanation. McAuliffe, as we noted in a Nov. 16 fact check, typically follows his claim about inheriting a $2.4 billion deficit with the kicker that he and lawmakers adroitly turned the problem "into a record surplus." He offered the same kicker on WRVA, noting that the so-called "record deficit" is "now a record surplus." Coy said McAuliffe inadvertently used the adjective "record" to describe both budget developments instead of just the surplus. "When you talk to the public all day, sometimes you have a slip of the tongue," Coy said. We know of no other instance where the governor made a similar claim about the shortfall. The record surplus stems from McAuliffe’s announcement in July 2015 that Virginia ended the first year of its biennial budget $550 million in the black. That slightly outstrips the previous surplus high of $545 million for the budget year ending in mid-2005, according to records going back to 1990. But it should be added that when adjusted for inflation, the 2005 surplus still is the highest. Some people seeing all these figures might conclude that Virginia’s budget has made an almost $3 billion rebound during the past year -- from a $2.4 billion shortfall in 2014 to a $550 million surplus this year. As we’ve noted before, that’s not the case. McAuliffe and the legislature overestimated the state’s economic problems in August 2014, when they adjusted the two-year budget to a "pessimistic" forecast of a $2.4 billion shortfall. That assumption turned out to be $550 million too high and produced the record surplus McAuliffe now cites. Our ruling McAuliffe said the $2.4 billion budget shortfall he and lawmakers resolved last year was "a record deficit" for Virginia. When we questioned about the assertion, a spokesman said the governor misspoke. Indeed, the reddest ink in Virginia was seen in 2010, when the state, in the teeth of recession, faced a $4.5 billion shortfall for the coming two-year budget. We don’t suggest the crisis McAuliffe faced was peanuts or question the explanation that he made a simple "slip of the tongue." But words matter, and we rate McAuliffe’s statement False.

pomt-07834	"The people that went to school with (Barack Obama), they never saw him, they don't know who he is."	pants on fire!	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/feb/14/donald-trump/donald-trump-says-people-who-went-school-obama-nev/	Donald Trump began a speech at the Conservative Political Action Conference on Feb. 10, 2011, by announcing that he is "thinking about" running for president. Too often, Trump said, successful people don't run for president because they don't want to be "scrutinized or abused." As a result, he said, we get presidents like Barack Obama. "Our current president came out of nowhere. Came out of nowhere," Trump said. "In fact, I'll go a step further: the people that went to school with him, they never saw him, they don't know who he is. It's crazy." The line drew big applause from the conservative audience. We tried unsuccessfully to reach Trump to see if he was suggesting that Obama led an unremarkable life during his school years, or if it was a wink to the conservative legions who are not convinced that Obama is a natural-born American citizen. In any case, Trump's comment harkens back to an attack line that dogged Obama throughout the 2008 presidential campaign -- that he had a shady background that didn't add up. First, we'll set the stage with a brief outline of Obama's academic career. Obama began his schooling in Indonesia (where his mother and step-father had moved from Hawaii), attending Besuki Public School and St. Francis of Assisi School, both in Jakarta, from ages 6 to 10. Obama then returned to Honolulu, Hawaii, to live with his maternal grandparents and attended Punahou School, a private college preparatory school, through high school. Obama began his college career at Occidental College in California in 1979. After two years, he transferred to Columbia University in New York City, where he studied political science and graduated with a B.A. in 1983. Obama later went to, and graduated from, Harvard Law School. We'll start in the middle of Obama's post-secondary education, his two years at Columbia, because that has been the nexus of previous "None-of-his-classmates-knew-him" claims. As Snopes.com points out in an October 2009 article debunking the claim, it appears to have roots in two sources. The first is a 2008 Wall Street Journal editorial about "Obama's Lost Years" at Columbia which states, "Fox News contacted some 400 of his classmates and found no one who remembered him." About the same time, Libertarian Party vice presidential nominee Wayne Allen Root -- who attended Columbia at the same time as Barack Obama -- told Reason: "I think the most dangerous thing you should know about Barack Obama is that I don't know a single person at Columbia that knows him, and they all know me. I don't have a classmate who ever knew Barack Obama at Columbia. Ever!" In a 2005 interview in an alumni magazine, Columbia College Today, Obama said that while at Columbia he was somewhat involved with the Black Students Organization and participated in anti-apartheid activities, but otherwise kept a fairly low profile. "Mostly, my years at Columbia were an intense period of study," said Obama, who lived off campus. "When I transferred, I decided to buckle down and get serious. I spent a lot of time in the library. I didn’t socialize that much. I was like a monk." So he wasn't BMOC. But he wasn't entirely invisible either. A May 15, 2008, story by the Associated Press, "Old friends recall Obama's years in LA, NY," quotes the recollections of an old roommate of Obama's in New York, Sohale Siddiqi. And former roommate and friend, Phil Boerner, has shared his recollections of Obama's time at Columbia with several reporters and is quoted in David Remnick's Obama's biography, The Bridge. The New York Times did an extensive interview with Boerner for a Jan. 20, 2009, story. And Politico posted online an article Obama wrote for Columbia's weekly magazine, The Sundial, which ran under the headline, "Breaking the War Mentality" on March 10, 1983. After FactCheck.org ran a story about the Columbia classmate's claim, another former classmate e-mailed to say she, too, remembered Obama. So we called her. Cathie Currie, who currently teaches social psychology at Adelphi University, recalled Obama joining her group occasionally to play pick-up soccer games on the lawn outside the library. She was a graduate student at the time, and Obama was an undergrad. He was a good soccer player, she said, even though basketball was his primary athletic passion. Obama also made an impression with his maturity and wisdom, she said. He talked about things like government for all the people, she said. In fact, Currie assumed because of Obama's heady conversation that he was a graduate student as well. Currie isn't surprised that he was not widely-remembered by fellow Columbia classmates. "My sense of it was that he was keeping a low profile," Currie said. He seemed like someone who had made a decision to prioritize his studies, she said. "We'd ask him to go out with us for beers after soccer," she said. "He seemed like he wanted to, but then he'd step back and say, 'Sorry, I'm going to the library.'" We're not going to spend too much time on Obama's time at Occidental and Harvard Law. Dozens of former classmates and teachers from those schools have publicly shared their recollections (and photos) of Obama. Obama was the president of the prestigious Harvard Law Review journal, for goodness sake. But here's a few stories chock full of classmates' recollections: New York Times, "In Law School, Obama Found Political Voice." Boston Globe, "At Harvard Law, a unifying voice: Classmates recall Obama as even-handed leader." The Weekly Standard, "The Real Obama." For this story, reporter Dean Barnett contacted dozens of Obama's classmates at Harvard Law School. "Also noteworthy is that virtually everyone seemed to know Obama," Bartnett wrote. YouTube.com even has this video of classmate Hill Harper talking about Obama. In fact, many of Obama's former classmates volunteered for his presidential campaign, and Politico ran a story about some 20 Harvard classmates who were members of his transition team. The story ran under the headline "School buds: 20 Harvard classmates advising Obama." As for Occidental, lots of former classmates and teachers have come forward to talk about the Obama they remember from his two years on campus there. For example, see the Los Angeles Times' Jan. 29, 2007, story, "Occidental recalls 'Barry' Obama." Trump casts a wide net with the statement "people that went to school with him." So we did a little digging to see whether there have been any classmates from elementary and high school who recall Obama. Plenty. A comprehensive story on Obama's childhood by the Chicago Tribune should put this to rest. By our count, it names -- and quotes -- more than a dozen former classmates and teachers from Obama's youth. Among those quoted are two students from each of the two schools Obama attended in Indonesia, as well as several of Obama's grade school teachers. They related stories of how Obama was teased because of his race, how he struggled with learning the Indonesian language, how he drew cartoons and even wrote an essay about how he wanted to be president one day. The story also quotes several classmates and teachers at Punahou School in Hawaii, a private school Obama attended in Hawaii through high school. Among them are some of Obama's closest childhood friends, as well as teachers. In his senior year, Obama's basketball team (he was not a starter) won a state championship in 1979. The Chicago Tribune notes that Obama was nicknamed "Barry O'Bomber" by teammates due to his accuracy on long jump shots. David Remnick's Obama biography The Bridge is sprinkled with quotes from former classmates and teachers of Obama in elementary and high school. We could get deeper into this but it seems like overkill. It's abundantly clear that there are lots and lots of former classmates who remember Obama at every level of school. It's true that Obama's two years at Columbia are relatively undocumented. And far fewer classmates have publicly shared recollections of Obama from that period, as opposed to other school years before and after. At Columbia, Obama was a transfer student, he lived off campus and by his and other accounts he buried himself in his studies and didn't socialize much. But even so, there are several students who recall Obama at Columbia. In short, media accounts and biographies are filled with on-the-record, named classmates who remember Obama. Trump is certainly right that presidential candidates are heavily scrutinized. As even a basic online search confirms, Obama's school years were, too. Trump's claim that people who went to school with Obama "never saw him, they don't know who he is" is ridiculous. Or, to borrow Trump's phrase, it's crazy. We rule Trump's statement Pants on Fire.

pomt-14410	Says Ted Cruz’s wife Heidi "will be the very first pro-life first lady."	mostly true	/colorado/statements/2016/mar/11/james-dobson/ted-cruz-ad-says-his-wife-will-be-very-first-pro-l/	There was a time when no presidential candidate's TV ad would trumpet his wife's views on abortion. But Sen. Ted Cruz's campaign does so proudly with an ad featuring James Dobson, the founder of Focus on the Family in Colorado, praising the Texas senator's spouse. "His wife, Heidi, will be the very first pro-life first lady," Dobson says in the TV ad, in which he also endorses Ted Cruz for president. The ad has aired about 30 times -- mostly in Iowa before the caucuses -- between November 2015 and late February 2016, according to PoliticalAdArchive.org It is an intriguing claim, so PolitiFact decided to examine its accuracy. For this analysis, we're defining "pro-life" as how the first ladies felt about access to abortion from a policy perspective, not their personal view. We asked the Cruz campaign for information supporting Dobson's claim. (Dobson's spokesman said Dobson was out of the country and unreachable for comment.) The Cruz campaign provided a 2012 Townhall.com report, headlined: "Surprising: Ann Romney would be first Pro-Life First Lady since Roe vs. Wade." The story says that every first lady from Pat Nixon to Michelle Obama has supported a woman’s freedom of choice on abortion -- even if some first ladies’ personally opposed abortion. Ann Romney, wife of then-Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney, in 2012 told ABC’s The View, "I am pro-life. I'm happy to say that." Clearly, Mrs. Cruz isn't the first candidate's wife to be held up as possibly the first pro-life first lady. And in this election year, Republican presidential candidate Marco Rubio’s wife, Jeanette, is also described -- along with Heidi Cruz -- as "Unapologetically Pro-Life." The New York Times reports that friends and colleagues "detect Mrs. Rubio’s influence on her husband’s outspoken opposition to abortion in almost all cases." Remember, in the Cruz campaign ad, Dobson says Heidi Cruz "will be the very first pro-life first lady," while the campaign’s supporting documentation is a story stating that all first ladies since the Supreme Court’s landmark Roe vs. Wade decision, which legalized abortion in 1973, have supported a woman’s choice on abortion. Experts say it is very difficult to find a first lady commenting on abortion before the court ruling, because few Americans publicly discussed the controversial issue, let alone presidents’ wives. "The reason people didn't discuss (abortion) back then was because it was illegal," said Carl Sferrazza Anthony, who is considered the foremost historian on the political and social power of first ladies. His books include the two-volume First Ladies: The Saga of the Presidents' Wives and Their Power, 1789-1990. Anthony said it is known that two pre-Roe vs. Wade first ladies, Jacqueline Kennedy and Lady Bird Johnson were "pro-choice." Yet this is why it’s hard to confirm or refute Dobson’s claim that Heidi Cruz’s anti-abortion stand would be a "first" for first ladies. In the past, if a first lady had opinions on abortion, "they weren’t made public," said Edith Mayo, a curator emerita at the Smithsonian's National Museum of American History, who oversaw a first ladies exhibit. "So you'd have a very difficult time tracing it," added Mayo, whose books include, First Ladies: Political Role and Public Image and The Smithsonian's Book of First Ladies. Anthony said first ladies’ reticence about discussing controversial issues changed during the national upheaval over the Vietnam War. Suddenly presidents’ wives, whose duties had historically tended toward ribbon cuttings and non-controversial projects, were facing tougher questions from reporters. "The Vietnam War is the turning point," said Anthony, who wrote speeches for Nancy Reagan. "So questions are asked to Pat Nixon that would never have been previously asked of her immediate successors. ... Mrs. Nixon really got to be the first one to be asked about the Equal Rights Amendment, about abortion, about amnesty for guys who didn't go to Vietnam." "From that point, every single (first lady) has had to address and respond to questions on important issues," he said. Yet it is true that every first lady since since Roe vs. Wade has publicly expressed their support for a woman’s choice on abortion. Here’s a list: Pat Nixon: In response to questions after the Roe vs. Wade decision, Pat Nixon said, "I believe abortion is a personal choice." A year before the ruling, she offered a more nuanced opinion: "I'm really not for abortion. I think it's a personal thing. I mean abortion on demand — wholesale." Betty Ford: When Barbara Walters asked her views on Roe vs. Wade, Ford called it "a great, great decision." As she later recalled the interview, "I just said, 'Well, I'm delighted because I'm glad they have taken abortion out of the backwoods and put it into the hospitals.' " Rosalynn Carter: At a 1980 press conference, Carter said she and her husband are "personally very opposed to abortion" and always have been. However, she supported the Roe vs. Wade decision while being against federal funding for abortion. "I oppose it for myself, but I have a hard time with deciding for other women what is right or wrong or best for them," Mrs. Carter once wrote. Nancy Reagan: After President Ronald Reagan had left office, Mrs. Reagan told a George Washington University class in 1994 that while she personally opposed abortion, she supported a woman’s right to choose. "I'm against abortion. On the other hand, I believe in a woman's choice," she said in response to a question from Anthony, her former speech writer who was teaching a class titled "The President's Spouse." Her comments were not a total surprise. According to a book by former White House chief of staff Donald Regan, Mrs. Reagan once said, "I don't give a damn about the pro-lifers," and demanded that all mention of abortion be removed from the president's 1987 State of the Union address. Barbara Bush: When her husband ran for president in 1980, Mrs. Bush drew attention by expressing her pro-choice views on abortion. Then, during President George H.W. Bush's 1992 re-election campaign against Bill Clinton, Mrs. Bush opposed Republicans placing an uncompromising anti-abortion policy in the GOP platform. She said it was a "personal thing" and added, "The personal things should be left out of, in my opinion, out of platforms and conventions," she told reporters. She later wrote in her memoirs, "She supports abortion rights. But, her opinion didn’t matter because she’s not elected by the American people." Hillary Clinton: In January 1999, Hillary Clinton ventured into new territory for a first lady by addressing NARAL -- then known as the National Abortion and Reproductive Rights Action League. She declared her goal of "keeping abortion safe, legal and rare into the next century" -- a phrase that's become her pro-choice mantra. "I have never met anyone who is pro-abortion," she told the crowd. "Being pro-choice is not being pro-abortion. Being pro-choice is trusting the individual to make the right decision for herself and her family, and not entrusting that decision to anyone wearing the authority of government in any regard." Laura Bush: While less of an activist than some first ladies, Laura Bush didn’t shy away from expressing her views -- even when they differed from her husband’s. Katie Couric asked her on the day of George W. Bush’s inauguration if Roe vs. Wade should be overturned, and Mrs. Bush replied "No." In her 2010 memoir, "Spoken from the Heart," Laura Bush writes, "While cherishing life, I have always believed that abortion is a private decision, and there, no one can walk in anyone else’s shoes." Michelle Obama: Mrs. Obama often speaks about her husband's support for a woman's choice on abortion. "And he believes that women are more than capable of making our own choices about our bodies and our health care ... that's what my husband stands for," Mrs. Obama said at the 2012 Democratic National Convention. Our ruling In the Ted Cruz campaign ad, James Dobson says, "His wife, Heidi, will be the very first pro-life first lady." In support of the claim, the campaign provided an article stating that all first ladies since the 1973 Roe vs. Wade decision have supported a woman’s choice on abortion. That is accurate. Yet, Dobson’s claim went further, stating that Mrs. Cruz would be the "very first pro-life first lady" -- the first in American history. Experts say it’s difficult to confirm or refute the claim because, while abortion has always been a controversial subject, before Roe vs. Wade it was also illegal. None of the experts we spoke with could cite a first lady publicly commenting on the issue before Roe vs. Wade, except for Jacqueline Kennedy and Lady Bird Johnson. This raises the possibility that other first ladies may have opposed abortion earlier in the country’s history, but never expressed it publicly. With that caveat, we rate the claim Mostly True.

pomt-00083	"I made my decision on Kavanaugh before the allegations surfaced, and it was all about Kavanaugh's alliance and allegiance to dark money and unlimited political contributions."	mostly false	/missouri/statements/2018/nov/01/claire-mccaskill/mccaskill-said-she-decided-her-kavanaugh-vote-alle/	Missouri Sen. Claire McCaskill has said repeatedly that she didn’t decide to vote "no" on then-Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh because of the sexual assault allegations against him. However, she did know about the allegations when she announced her decision, a fact she denied during an Oct. 25, 2018, debate against Republican challenger and Missouri Attorney General Josh Hawley. "I made my decision on Kavanaugh before the allegations surfaced, and it was all about Kavanaugh's alliance and allegiance to dark money and unlimited political contributions," McCaskill said during the debate. Here's the timeline: The Washington Post published its story outlining California professor Christine Blasey Ford’s allegations of Kavanaugh’s sexual misconduct on Sept. 16, 2018. As of that date, McCaskill had yet to announce how she would vote on the nominee. The next day, Sept. 17, 2018, statement said that she was "deeply troubled by these allegations" and that they should be investigated by the Senate Judiciary Committee. In it, she did not disclose how she planned to vote. McCaskill’s statement about her vote came a few days later, on Sept. 19, 2018. In that statement, she acknowledged the allegations against Kavanaugh but said that she did not base her decision on them. "(W)hile the recent allegations against him are troubling and deserve a thorough and fair examination by the Senate Judiciary Committee, my decision is not based on those allegations but rather on his positions on several key issues, most importantly the avalanche of dark, anonymous money that is crushing our democracy," the statement read. McCaskill repeated a version of the claim in an Oct. 30 interview with CNN, saying she "made her decision before the allegations had even really surfaced, way before the ugly confirmation process." McCaskill’s decision to vote "no" did precede other allegations of sexual misconduct. The story about a second woman, Deborah Ramirez, broke in the New Yorker on Sept. 23, 2018. A third accuser, Julie Swetnick, came forward on Sept. 26. Ford and Kavanaugh testified in front of the Senate Judiciary Committee on Sept. 27, 2018, a little more than a week after McCaskill made her official statement. Our ruling McCaskill said that she made her decision to vote against Kavanaugh before allegations of sexual misconduct surfaced. McCaskill did say in her statement at the time that her "no" vote was based on Kavanaugh's position on several issues, including dark money. But McCaskill did know about the sexual assault allegation from Ford. The other allegations from Ramirez and Swetnick had not yet been made public. We rate this claim Mostly False.

pomt-00573	"In Florida, when Jeb Bush was governor, state authorities conducted a deeply flawed purge of voters before the presidential election in 2000" and "in 2004 a plan to purge even more voters was headed off."	mostly true	/florida/statements/2015/jun/09/hillary-clinton/hillary-clinton-revisits-floridas-2000-and-2004-vo/	In a speech calling for an expansion of voting rights, Hillary Clinton attacked what she described as efforts to restrict voting by Republican governors thinking of running for president, including former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush. "In Florida, when Jeb Bush was governor, state authorities conducted a deeply flawed purge of voters before the presidential election in 2000. Thankfully, in 2004 a plan to purge even more voters was headed off," she said in a speech at Texas Southern University on June 4, 2015. We decided to look back at the 2000 and 2004 voter purges in Florida to see if her description was accurate. The 2000 purge In 1997, thousands of corrupt votes were cast in a Miami mayoral election, prompting state lawmakers to approve election legislation in 1998. The bill went into effect without the signature of Gov. Lawton Chiles, a Democrat. (A spokesman for Chiles at the time told the Miami Herald that he objected to a provision in the law related to absentee ballots.) This was the legislation that eventually led to the 2000 purge. The 1998 law provided $4 million to weed out dead people and felons from the state's voter rolls. So the Department of State hired Boca Raton-based DTS Technologies to produce a list of possible felons. (In Florida, a felon couldn’t vote unless he or she underwent a cumbersome restoration process overseen by the governor and Cabinet.) The company warned the state that their matches would produce many false positives, but state officials wanted DTS to use broad parameters, which meant more felons off the rolls. In August 1998, Secretary of State Sandra Mortham announced that about 50,000 felons and 17,000 dead people were on the voter rolls. Almost immediately, questions arose about the accuracy of the list. Twenty county election supervisors decided to ignore the state’s directive, because they found the data unreliable, including a Marion County elections supervisor who found her own name on the list. Leon County Supervisor of Elections Ion Sancho said he received a list of about 700 names before the 2000 election. "We did a check on it and could only find 30-some felons," Sancho said. "We cleared 94 percent of the list." But not all counties did their own research on the "deeply flawed" list, he said. "If you went to vote on Nov. 7, and an official said you are on the list, if you tried to argue you could be arrested, and you were told so," he said. Ultimately, it was Mortham’s successor, Katherine Harris, elected in 1998, who oversaw the 2000 purge along with a state elections lawyer Emmett Mitchell. (In 2003, Florida’s elected secretary of state became an appointed position.) After the election, news organizations and other groups tried to figure out how many people had been denied the right to vote. But the numbers varied widely — though the reported estimates were higher than George W. Bush’s 537-margin in the 2000 presidential election. A 2001 Palm Beach Post investigation asserted that at least 1,100 eligible voters were wrongly purged. Other reports put the figure much higher. The NAACP and American Civil Liberties Union sued the state in 2000, and the settlement required the state to run its old felon lists with new standards. At a hearing before the U.S. Civil Rights Commission in January 2001, Bush placed the blame for the state’s woes on election officials. But a divided commission concluded that many Florida leaders were responsible, including Bush, for the "unjust removal of disproportionate numbers of African American voters." A week later, Bush along with the Cabinet implemented the commission’s recommendation to make the clemency process easier for ex-felons seeking to restore their voting rights. Botched purge in 2004 The state compiled a new list of 47,000 potential felons before the 2004 election. But after a lawsuit forced the state to make the list publicly available in July 2004, the Miami Herald reported that more than 2,000 of those names -- many of them black Democrats -- should not have been on the list, because their rights to vote were restored through the state's clemency process. A separate issue was that Hispanics made up 0.1 percent of the list, in a state where nearly one in five residents were Hispanic. The state’s criminal database didn’t have "Hispanic" as a category, but voter registration rolls did have it, which created a discrepancy. Less than two weeks after the list was released, the state scrapped the entire list, saying it was flawed. Not including Hispanic felons on the list "was an oversight and a mistake. … And we accept responsibility, and that's why we're pulling it back," Bush said at the time. But even before they tossed the list, state officials knew it was flawed. A May 2 internal memo detailed a half dozen missed deadlines, failed software programs, repeated miscues and personnel problems. Our ruling Clinton said, "In Florida, when Jeb Bush was governor, state authorities conducted a deeply flawed purge of voters before the presidential election in 2000" and "in 2004 a plan to purge even more voters was headed off." Clinton omits that this effort started before Bush was in office, though it did continue under his watch. In 2004, the state scrapped another purge after officials admitted errors. The statement is accurate but needs additional information. So we rate it Mostly True. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/f3460a63-5e8e-495c-9b16-f7881257edc0	None	Hillary Clinton	None	None	None	2015-06-09T12:18:45	2015-06-04	['Jeb_Bush', 'Florida']
pomt-02778	"I have cut taxes 63 times, including a 2006 property tax reduction that ranks as the largest in state history."	mostly false	/texas/statements/2013/dec/08/david-dewhurst/dewhurst-didnt-personally-cut-taxes-and-some-incre/	David Dewhurst, seeking his fourth term as lieutenant governor of Texas, consistently talks up the state’s economy while simultaneously noting tax cuts. The Houston Republican, who presides over the Texas Senate, touted 54 tax cuts in a recent video ad. A bit earlier, in an Oct. 1, 2013, post on his campaign website, he took credit for even more. "Under my leadership, the Texas Senate has helped strengthen our state’s foundation with essential conservative legislation," Dewhurst said. His post singled out actions to balance budgets, address border security and tort reform, stop Medicaid from expanding, restrict abortions--and to cut taxes. The Senate passed legislation to cut "taxes for all Texans," Dewhurst’s web post continued. "I have cut taxes 63 times, including a 2006 property tax reduction that ranks as the largest in state history." Dozens of Dewhurst-provided cuts? We were curious. Big picture, Texans paid about the same level of taxes in 2010 (the latest year of available data) as they did when Dewhurst took over as lieutenant governor in 2003, according to calculations by the non-partisan Tax Foundation in Washington, D.C. Foundation figures indicate that on average, Texans ponied up 5.7 percent of their personal income for state and local taxes in Texas both of those years. Still, in between that percentage dropped to as little as 5.1 percent, in 2006 and 2008, the figures suggest. After we inquired into Dewhurst’s reference to cutting taxes 63 times, Dewhurst’s campaign blog post was amended to say 54 cuts. We stuck with checking what was posted for about two months. Earlier, to our request for backup information, Dewhurst campaign spokesman Travis Considine emailed a document headlined "David Dewhurst Tax Cuts" stating that since becoming lieutenant governor, Dewhurst "has cut taxes by more than $15 billion through 63 pieces of legislation." Among the listed measures, a 2006 measure setting in motion one-third reductions in school district maintenance and operation property tax rates is credited with "savings" of more than $12.6 billion, accounting for 84 percent of Dewhurst’s total declared savings. A convention of Texas state government is to estimate costs and savings in one- or two-year increments. That's probably because lawmakers almost always budget two years at a time. By email, Considine told us the campaign chose to list five-year savings figures when they were available from fiscal notes written by budget board staff at the time the cited measures passed into law. He didn’t say why. Not noted on Dewhurst's backup: The 2006 reduction was partly funded by tax increases. According to a chart emailed to us Dec. 3, 2013, by John Barton, a staff spokesman for the Legislative Budget Board, the various increases were initially projected to raise nearly $4.7 billion in the fiscal year that ran through August 2011. In that year, the chart indicates, the property-tax reductions were expected to cost the state about $7 billion--while in reality, the tax hikes generated about $2.5 billion less in 2011 than initially predicted. We took a long look at the campaign's list of tax-cut measures, finding the vast majority to be carefully targeted, that is, not necessarily benefiting every Texan. By our count, about 40 of the changes in law related to exempting particular entities or transactions from sales or property taxes, many of them not lacking a precise savings estimate. Dewhurst’s document lists about 10 sales tax-cut measures. The largest, at a value of about $700 million through five years, is a 2013 law exempting from the sales tax through 2026 "depreciable tangible personal property directly used in qualified research," the legislation’s fiscal note states. Another 2013 law provided for sales tax refunds to providers of cable or Internet access was projected by the budget board at a value of $250 million over five years. Dewhurst’s document also specifies a 2009 law placing backpacks among items subject to the state’s annual three-day "sales tax holiday," a change projected to save affected taxpayers more than $40 million over five years, according to the proposal’s fiscal note. Also noted: A 2007 law exempting pay-phone calls from the sales tax at a projected five-year value of more than $6 million, per the relevant state fiscal note. Among about 30 listed measures touching on property taxes, a 2013 law exempted equipment in certain data centers from property taxes at a projected five-year value of $58 million. A 2007 law protecting elderly and disabled homeowners with homestead exemptions from being stuck with potentially higher school taxes was projected by the state to save beneficiaries (and cost the state) $745 million over five years, while a 2009 law giving full homestead exemptions to fully disabled veterans was predicted to be worth more than $50 million over five years. Dewhurst’s document lists a half-dozen laws related to the business franchise tax, though there appears to be a little duplication in that an exemption of small businesses was simply extended. A 2013 law changing who pays the tax, extending a small business exemption and temporarily lowering the tax rate was projected to reduce such tax collections by $1.3 billion over five years. By far, though, the stand-out measure on Dewhurst’s list is House Bill 1, signed into law by Gov. Rick Perry in May 2006 and described by Dewhurst as cutting school property taxes by more than $12.6 billion over five years. We couldn’t confirm that figure, but the budget board chart shows more than $30 billion in state expenditures from 2007 through 2011 to cover the state costs of the tax cuts. Separately, it’s been disputed whether the 2006 actions whittled taxes as much as some ballyhooed. In 2010, we rated as Mostly False a Perry claim that "we cut property taxes by one third." The tax-rate mandate did reduce school property taxes at first. School tax collections declined 6.4 percent between 2005 and 2007, the year the cuts were fully implemented, according to the Texas Education Agency, which also offered us data showing that collections for school maintenance and operations taxes were 30.2 percent lower in 2007 than the state projected they would have been without the tax cut. A business group, the Texas Taxpayers and Research Association, reached a similar conclusion by comparing 2007 school property taxes with what it calculated Texans would have paid without the mandated cut. The related savings were about $7 billion, it said. "The average Texan's total property tax bill in 2007 was 20 percent lower than what it likely would have been had there been no tax relief initiative," the group concluded. Then again, school property tax collections ultimately increased partly because districts had leeway to inch up their rates over the years and benefited, in many cases, from increasing property values. In both 2006 and 2007, the total taxable value of property in Texas rose more than 10 percent each year. The taxpayer association identified other reasons that the overall reduction in property taxes did not meet expectations: increases in the portion of school taxes dedicated to bond debt, as well as increases in taxes paid to cities, counties and other taxing districts. As we noted above, Dewhurst’s declared tax cuts were accompanied by some tax hikes intended to make up a portion of the school revenue lost due to the rate reductions. As described in a TTARA guide to Texas school funding, revised in January 2012, legislators created a tax-relief fund to reimburse districts by drawing on revenue gains from a revised and expanded business franchise tax and increases in state cigarette and tobacco taxes, plus a change in how the state calculates the taxable price of used cars and trucks. According to the guide, some $2.2 billion was to be pulled from the fund in the 2011-12 school year. A May 19, 2006, Austin American-Statesman news article called the expansion of the state’s business tax the "centerpiece" of Perry’s plan to cut school property taxes. As he signed the business-tax measure into law, Perry said: ""Today I am proud to sign into law landmark business tax reforms that will provide greater fairness for employers, reliable funding for our school classrooms and revenue that will help deliver a record $15.7 billion property tax cut for the people of Texas." The Statesman story continued: "The plan cuts property tax rates for school operations by one-third over two years. It adds $1 per pack to the cigarette tax. The plan will cut more in taxes than it brings in, and it includes $1.5 billion in increased school spending, including $2,000 pay raises for teachers." Considine stressed to us by email that there was still a net tax decrease thanks to the 2006 actions. The record-breaking part of Dewhurst's blog-post claim rings true. We recalled only one other substantial statewide property-tax break. The 1997 Legislature sent voters a proposed constitutional amendment, subsequently adopted, increasing from $5,000 to $15,000 the residential homestead exemption from school property taxes, a change then estimated to save a typical Texas homeowner about $12 a month, according to a July 1997 report by the House Research Organization. That report also said: "The net result would be one of the largest tax reductions in state history." By email, school finance expert Joe Wisnoski of Austin offered his ballpark estimate that the 1997 actions have a current-day annual value of about $$650 million to $700 million with the annual value of the 2006 tax-rate actions being far more--at least $6 billion, he said. Finally, we identified no reason to believe Dewhurst didn’t support all the tax-cut proposals passed into law on his watch. He’s a long-time Republican leader in the Republican-steered Capitol. But he didn’t personally cut any taxes. He had no vote on the listed measures--those belonged to senators and House members. On the other hand, his powers include the appointment of pivotal Senate committees, the reference of individual proposals to particular committees and the setting of the Senate's floor agenda. He was a gavel-wielding player. Our ruling Dewhurst said: "I have cut taxes 63 times, including a 2006 property tax reduction that ranks as the largest in state history." This statement paints an incomplete picture. About 63 (or 54) measures giving someone a tax break passed into law on Dewhurst’s watch, but it's not like Texans are less tapped by such taxes of late than before. Notably, too, most of the touted laws targeted particular beneficiaries. Also, Dewhurst didn't personally cut any taxes; those decisions involved the House, Senate and governor, though Dewhurst was a leader. The 2006 school property-tax-rate reduction was historic. But this statement fails to acknowledge that actions Dewhurst helped usher into place the same year led to hundreds of millions of dollars in lesser tax increases. All told, this claim contains an element of truth, but overlooks critical facts that would give a full, accurate impression. We rate it as Mostly False.

pomt-06414	"After every major conflict ... what happened was that we ultimately hollowed out the force, largely by doing deep, across-the-board cuts."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/oct/26/leon-panetta/leon-panetta-says-military-has-hollowed-out-after-/	In congressional testimony reported in a New York Times article on Oct. 23, 2011, Defense Secretary Leon Panetta warned against cutting defense spending too severely as the U.S. winds down its involvement in Iraq and reconsiders how to proceed in Afghanistan. "After every major conflict — World War I, World War II, Korea, Vietnam, the fall of the Soviet Union — what happened was that we ultimately hollowed out the force, largely by doing deep, across-the-board cuts that impacted on equipment, impacted on training, impacted on capability," Panetta said. "Whatever we do in confronting the challenges we face now on the fiscal side, we must not make that mistake." After a reader pointed out this quote to us, we decided it was worth checking. Before starting our analysis, we’ll note a few factors. First, on the statistical side, we’ll look overall defense spending, and troop levels. For spending, experts told us that the best figures to use are inflation-adjusted, annual totals. Second, the definition of the key phrase Panetta used -- "hollowing out" -- is open to interpretation. "‘Hollowing out’ is a rather imprecise term that is floating around the Pentagon a lot these days," said Todd Harrison, senior fellow for defense budget studies at the Center for Strategic and Budgetary Assessments, an independent think tank on defense and related spending. "It can mean not providing troops with adequate pay and benefits so that the best ones leave. It can mean not providing troops with adequate training, leaving them unprepared for combat. Or it can mean providing troops with substandard equipment, poorly maintained equipment or an insufficient quantity of equipment. When Panetta and others in the Pentagon say this, I’m not sure if they mean all of these things happened in the past or just some of them." The Pentagon did not respond to a query seeking data and background to support Panetta’s point, so we turned to a range of military experts and historians to assess whether the U.S. military experienced a "hollowing out" as Panetta said. Now, let’s look at some numbers. For spending, we measured the decline from the peak spending year of the war to the lowest level within five years after hostilities ended. The full details of our methodology can be found here, but the bottom line is that defense spending fell after World War II by 92 percent, after the Korean War by 53 percent, after the Vietnam War by 26 percent and after the Cold War by 28 percent. As for worldwide troop levels, they fell by 27 percent after the Korean War, by 40 percent after the Vietnam War and by 32 percent after the Cold War. (The data we found did not include numbers for the aftermath of World War I, or for troop levels after World War II.) What both of these measurements show is that for the periods following Korea, Vietnam and the end of the Cold War, both defense spending and worldwide troop levels declined by about one-quarter to one-half within a few years. So Panetta has a point. Still, determining whether these declines led to a "hollowing out" requires looking at more than just the raw numbers. After all, it’s no surprise that both military spending and troop levels would decline after a war concludes. A more relevant question is whether the decreases were severe enough in their scope and composition to hurt the United States’ ability to act militarily, given the threats the nation faced at the time. This is more of a judgment call, and the experts we contacted expressed some ambivalence. "The accuracy of Panetta's statement largely hinges on how you define ‘hollowed out the force, largely by doing deep, across-the board cuts,’" said Lance Janda, a historian at Cameron University. "His point is that during periods of budget cutting, we have to make smart choices, rather than cutting everything back the same amount, and that our choices have to reflect the threats we'll face in the future. That's a point I suspect most people would agree with. My caveat is that his use of historical examples is a bit suspect, and doesn't reflect the political realities that governed defense spending during the 20th century." Let’s take a look at the political, economic and military contexts surrounding each of the post-war periods Panetta cited. Post-World War I The cuts made after World War I are universally considered to have been major. But at least one historian we contacted believes that the damage to American military capabilities has been overstated. "We did make huge cuts in defense spending after World War I, but that was to be expected after waging a massive conflict in Europe and was vital in that we could not have sustained wartime spending levels indefinitely," Janda said. "The cuts made sense in that we faced no serious threat to the continental United States, and they were unavoidable in a political environment that by the mid 1920s had concluded that our involvement in World War I had been a mistake." The arrival of the Great Depression in 1929 made the need for cuts even more urgent, Janda said. He added that the largest cuts came in Army spending, under the belief that the Navy was the nation’s first line of defense and critical to protecting overseas possessions. Once it became clear in the late 1930s that conflict with Japan and Germany was likely, military spending began to rise again. "Should we have started sooner? Maybe," Janda said. "Should we have spent more on the Army? Yes. But that's in hindsight, and it's not like the cuts of the 1920s were still haunting us in 1939. So I think that while Mr. Panetta is right about the fact that we cut defense spending after World War I, he's overstating the case to argue that those cuts ‘hollowed out’ the force that existed when we were threatened almost 20 years later." Post-World War II The decline in defense spending after World War II was massive and rapid. The U.S. Army shrank from 89 divisions in 1945 to 10 in 1950, said Ted Wilson, a historian at the University of Kansas. In this context, June 1950 -- the start of the Korean War -- came as "a rude awakening," said William W. Stueck, historian at the University of Georgia. Unlike the two-decade period between the world wars, the Korean War came about five years after the end of World War II, and for this reason it has become a poster child for the dangers of a "hollowed out" military. But even here the situation is more complicated. Janda notes that, as after World War I, cuts were made because "our wartime spending levels were politically and economically unsustainable. Did we hollow out the force? I don't think so. It dramatically shrunk in size, to be sure, but we still had the largest navy and air force on the planet. What cost us in Korea in 1950 was that the veterans of World War II had largely gone home, and the Army was composed of draftees with no combat experience. It's also true that our tanks and bazookas could have been better, and that the Army took the brunt of the cuts between 1945 and 1950. But again, that was because we made a choice and decided that in a world with nuclear weapons that we were better off putting the bulk of our resources into the Air Force and the Navy as our first line of defense." Post-Korean War Unlike the enormous decreases following both World Wars, the aftermath of the Korean War was the first in a series of more modest cutbacks. The key difference is that by then the Cold War was underway, and the U.S. determined that a standing military -- one backed by cutting-edge technology from a permanent defense industry -- was necessary. After the Korean War, President Dwight Eisenhower "continued to see a high-level -- even an expanding -- security threat from the Soviet Union," Stueck said. But because of concerns that high military spending could be a threat to the U.S. economy, Eisenhower made substantial cuts in the Army (his old branch), though he increased Air Force spending. When John F. Kennedy entered office, he pursued an expansion of the defense budget even before the escalation in Vietnam. Both Janda and Harrison see this period as a weak link in Panetta’s claim. "Eisenhower made a number of deliberate decisions in the early 1950s to shift the focus of military strategy from fighting major ground wars like Korea to using nuclear deterrence to stop Soviet expansion," Harrison said. "These were not blind, across-the-board cuts, as Panetta suggests, but rather were targeted cuts that reflected a shift in strategy." Post-Vietnam War The term "hollowed out" is most widely associated with the post-Vietnam era, when the United States was recovering from an unpopular war. There’s wide consensus that military readiness -- not to mention a willingness to intervene militarily -- slumped in the 1970s, which provides some support for Panetta’s claim. But even here, several experts said that the "hollowing out" had a lot to do with the military’s shift from the draft to an all-volunteer force -- an important transformational change that caused some short-term challenges. "After the all-volunteer force was instituted in 1973 and wages increased to attract quality volunteers, morale rose to new peaks," said Tim Kane, a senior fellow at the Ewing Marion Kauffman Foundation. Another factor was more obscure -- procurement decisions made under President Richard Nixon. "The biggest problem we had in the 1970s was that we needed new tanks and aircraft, and we didn't have them because of decisions made in the 1960s and early 1970s by the Nixon administration, the Army, and the Air Force," Janda said. Systems like the M-1 Abrams, the B-1 bomber, the MX Missile, Cruise missiles and stealth fighters were in the pipeline, he said, but they were ready only by the time Ronald Reagan became president, he said. So while the term "hollowing out" may be apt for the post-Vietnam period, it’s more of a stretch to say it was caused by "deep, across-the-board cuts." Post-Cold War There was a "peace dividend" after the end of the Cold War, but it was limited by the rapid emergence of the Persian Gulf War. And during the 1990s, the United States participated in a large number of limited military interventions in such places as Bosnia, Kosovo, Somalia, Haiti and the no-fly zones in Iraq, often using air power, sometimes combined with specialized ground forces. "Were we ‘hollowed out?’ No," Janda said. "We were still the most powerful nation on the planet. But we had to make choices, just like the Romans did 2,000 years ago when they stopped expanding and limited the number of legions in the Roman Army. No nation can afford to spend too much on defense." Our ruling Panetta said that "after every major conflict — World War I, World War II, Korea, Vietnam, the fall of the Soviet Union — what happened was that we ultimately hollowed out the force, largely by doing deep, across-the-board cuts." He’s correct that spending and troop levels fell -- enormously after the World Wars, more modestly after the other conflicts. But there’s less consensus that the cuts -- particularly the ones that followed after the conclusion of Korean War and the Cold War -- led to a "hollowed out" force. We think it’s a stretch to suggest, as Panetta does, that cuts were made across the board. In most cases, the cuts weren’t knee-jerk but were in fact made with a larger strategy in mind. On balance, we rate Panetta’s comment Half True. CORRECTION: The quote checked in this item was made at a congressional hearing. While the comment was included in a recent New York Times story, it was not made during one of Panetta's two interviews for the that story, as the initial version of this story had indicated.

pomt-01621	Under a proposed medical marijuana amendment in Florida, "you don't get refills -- you get it forever."	mostly false	/florida/statements/2014/aug/28/drug-free-america/medical-marijuana-amendment-allows-patient-get-it-/	Opponents have made many arguments against Florida’s proposed medical marijuana amendment, but here’s a new one: They say patients would be able to get an unlimited amount of pot should the measure pass. Dr. Rafael Miguel, director of the Sarasota Memorial Institute for Advanced Medicine's Pain Medicine Program, was one of three representatives for Drug Free America who visited the Tampa Bay Times editorial board on Aug. 20. He joined Pinellas County Sheriff Bob Gualtieri and Tallahassee attorney Susan Kelsey to discuss why the Sunshine State should shy away from Amendment 2 in November. Miguel offered several reasons why the medical establishment did not like the constitutional amendment. He said there was an unreasonable focus on marijuana’s smokeable form in order to obtain psychoactive effects, and added that the process by which doctors help patients get cannabis flies in the face of the prescription model of doling out drugs. Miguel focused on how "recommendations" to use marijuana are not prescriptions, and that they don’t allow doctors to control the amount and dosage patients consume, or for how long they consume it. "You don't get refills -- you get it forever," Miguel said. "There's no regulation on consumption." PolitiFact Florida has written about the amendment’s guidelines before, but we were curious in this case whether doctors who recommend medical marijuana to patients would indeed have no say in how much or for how long their patients could take it. Following guidelines Medical marijuana is legal in 23 states and the District of Columbia. (Colorado and Washington state have gone a step further by legalizing cannabis for recreational use, even though the cultivation, possession and use of the drug remains against federal law.) Doctors in states that allow medical marijuana don’t prescribe the drug -- that could potentially lead to federal sanctions, since the U.S. government classifies marijuana as a Schedule I drug. Inclusion on that list means, legally, that marijuana has no known medical benefits, even though that claim is much disputed. Instead, in states that allow medical marijuana, doctors recommend people who suffer from certain approved conditions -- typically diseases like cancer, Parkinson’s disease, ALS, or other conditions causing chronic pain. States make their own rules for supplying the drug that vary from state to state. Florida’s Amendment 2 says that, should the initiative pass, the state Department of Health would create guidelines for the manufacture, distribution and use of marijuana. That worries opponents like Drug Free America; they argue that the language is too broad to limit the scope of the drug’s impact on the state. Miguel didn’t immediately return PolitiFact Florida’s request for more specifics about what he meant. During his editorial board visit he made it clear he preferred the FDA-approved process of writing prescriptions with a specified dosage, duration, potency and number of refills, using clinically tested drugs. The amendment doesn’t give doctors any of that control, Miguel said, and it doesn’t define any limit. In general, the measure says the state Department of Health will create regulations. However, the initiative does lay out some of the process. It defines a written "physician certification" as a document that says the doctor feels the patient has a condition that may be aided by the use of cannabis and specifies "for how long the physician recommends the medical use of marijuana for the patient." There also is a section that requires the Florida Department of Health to create "a regulation that defines the amount of marijuana that could reasonably be presumed to be an adequate supply for qualifying patients’ medical use, based on the best available evidence." That limit on quantity could be waived, depending on the patient’s condition. The language prevents a strict interpretation of how involved a doctor would be, said attorney Kelsey, who has criticized the amendment for being so vague it would eventually be challenged in the state supreme court. "As I read it, the doctor doesn’t say the amount at all," Kelsey said. "He just gives the patient the certification and it says for how long, then the patient gets their ID card and takes that to the dispensary and that is the point at which the quantity is determined and handed out." So how is the drug distributed in states that allow it? Every state has different regulations for the process, but a good benchmark for Florida may be Nevada, because it passed medical marijuana as a constitutional amendment instead of as legislation. Colorado adopted constitutional amendments in 2000 and 2014, but the second one legalized recreational use, which the Florida Amendment does not do. Passed by voters in 2000, the Nevada amendment language was even shorter and more vague than the Florida proposal. It required the state Legislature to provide for a registry and to create guidelines, a process delegated to the state Department of Health and Human Services in subsequent legislation. As of 2013, Nevada limited patients to 2.5 ounces of marijuana every 14 days. Patients must get an ID card through a registry, and must renew their membership on the registry with a doctor’s approval every year. Even in states that allow patients to grow their own marijuana plants, there are legal limits to how much they can cultivate. It’s a moot point in Florida, because the amendment doesn’t allow for personal cultivation. Many laws or regulations also say doctors can tell the state agency in charge if they think a patient would no longer benefit from medical marijuana, according to Karen O’Keefe, state policy director at the Marijuana Policy Project, which favors regulations like Amendment 2. "In most cases, the laws also specify that the card becomes void if the patient ceases to have the qualifying condition," O’Keefe said. "I see no reason why regulators couldn’t include similar provisions in Florida." Our ruling Miguel said when it comes to doctor’s recommendations for medical marijuana, "You don't get refills, you get it forever." He was referring to how a doctor’s "recommendation" for cannabis does not allow the same level of control as a medical prescription does. He said there was no written limitation on how much or for how long a patient could get marijuana in the amendment, a common criticism by opponents of the amendment. It’s possible that potential Florida regulations would not limit time on a registry or how long a doctor’s certification would last for a patient. But it would be premature, and speculative, to assume that there would be no way under the amendment to stop a recommendation from going on forever. Other states have created their own rules, limiting the quantity and frequency of the drug that patients can get. They also limit how long patients can be on a registry before requiring a doctor’s approval. We rate the statement Mostly False. CORRECTION, AUG. 29, 2014: This version of the article has been updated to reflect that Colorado passed constitutional amendments in 2000 and 2012, the latter of which allows recreational use of marijuana.

pomt-13066	California has seen a "56 percent decline in the gun murder rate" since the 1990s.	mostly true	/california/statements/2016/nov/16/gavin-newsom/gavin-newsom-understates-californias-rapid-drop-gu/	California voters added to what are considered the nation’s strongest gun control laws on Election Day by approving Proposition 63. The measure imposes background checks on ammunition sales; bans possession of large-capacity ammunition magazines; and forces owners to give up their weapons as soon as they can no longer legally possess them. Lt. Governor Gavin Newsom, who is running for governor in 2018, helped author the initiative and led the campaign for it. The measure had received nearly 63 percent approval as of mid-November, with some votes still uncounted. In a press conference the day after Prop 63 passed, Newsom made several claims about the effectiveness of California’s gun restrictions. "We have significantly reduced the gun-murder rate because of our progressive gun policy," Newsom said, adding that California has seen a "56 percent decline in the gun murder rate since we started to step up and step in and lead the nation in common sense gun safety laws, background checks, restricting large-capacity clips and the like." Gavin Newsom makes his claim about California's gun murder rate at about the 6:30 minute mark in the video above. We decided to focus on Newsom’s claim that California has seen a "56 percent decline in the gun murder rate" since it began imposing tough gun laws in the 1990s. Whether those gun laws are the driving force behind such a drop is a matter of mixed opinion. Gun rights groups say tougher criminal penalties, not gun laws, have led to the decline. PolitiFact does not fact-check predictions or opinions. A Glock 30SF .45 Auto semi-automatic pistol with a Glock 13-round extension magazine installed, and 13 rounds of hollow-point ammunition are seen in Alexandria, Va., Wednesday, Feb. 10, 2016. (AP Photo/Cliff Owen) Our research The gun murder rate measures the number of gun-related homicides per 100,000 residents in a geographical area. A separate measurement, the gun death rate, takes a broader look including homicides, suicides and accidental shooting deaths. Based on our research and contact with Newsom’s campaign spokesman, it appears the lieutenant governor mixed up the two rates and ended up understating the drop in California’s gun murder rate by more than 10 percentage points. The state’s gun death rate -- not the gun murder rate -- dropped 56 percent from 1993 to 2013, according to figures provided by Ari Freilich, an attorney at the San Francisco-based Law Center for Gun Violence Prevention. The attorney cited age-adjusted data from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The nonprofit law center advocates for gun control laws and is considered an authority on gun crime statistics. The law center’s figures do not include data from 2014, a year in which gun deaths and gun homicides continued to fall in California. Nor do they include statistics from 2015 and 2016, which are not yet available. Still, the 20-year span is the approximate period during which California imposed strict new gun laws, spurred by mass shootings years earlier on a Stockton schoolyard and inside a San Francisco law office. This meant the rate of deaths by any kind of shooting declined from 17.48 per 100,000 residents in 1993 to 7.68 per 100,000 residents. Larger drop in gun murder rate During this same period, California’s gun murder rate declined even faster: By 65 percent, according to a review of the CDC’s fatal injury reports by PolitiFact California. If 2014 is included, the rate dropped by 67 percent. Data from these reports have been cited by both gun control and gun rights groups to describe California’s decline in gun violence. They show gun murders fell from 9.60 per 100,000 residents in 1993 to 3.14 per 100,000 in 2014. In raw numbers, this means nearly 2,000 fewer people in California died in gun homicides in 2014 (when 1,233 were killed) compared with 1993 (when 3,183 were killed). Nationwide, the gun murder rate fell 45 percent during much of the same period. Between 1993 and 2000, it dropped from 7.0 homicides to 3.8 homicides per 100,000 people, according to a Pew Research analysis in 2015 of available federal data. Since then, Pew reported, the rate has remained relatively flat. Our ruling California Lt. Gov. Gavin Newsom said California has seen a "56 percent decline in the gun murder rate" since it enacted strong gun control laws in the 1990s. Newsom appears to have mixed up the gun murder rate with the gun death rate. California’s gun murder rate dropped 67 percent between 1993 and 2014, according to a review of fatal injury report data from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. A similar, though somewhat smaller, drop in the gun murder rate took place nationwide during this period. Newsom’s overall point is correct: Gun deaths, including gun homicides, have dropped significantly in California since the state imposed the new laws. We are not fact-checking the cause of this drop. Gun rights and gun control groups have different opinions on this. What is clear is that gun homicides have declined significantly, and even faster than what Newsom stated. His claim needs this key clarification. We rate it Mostly True. MOSTLY TRUE – The statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information.

pomt-02333	"A child born in America today will inherit $1.5 million in debt the moment they're placed in their mother's arms."	mostly true	/georgia/statements/2014/mar/26/john-mccallum/candidate-worries-about-growing-federal-debt/	A congressional candidate recently offered some news that might make a child never want to grow up. "A child born in America today will inherit $1.5 million in (federal) debt the moment they're placed in their mother's arms," John McCallum, a St. Simons Island resident who is running as a Republican for Congress, said in one campaign ad. "For children like mine, it’s not the American Dream. It’s the American nightmare." A PolitiFact Georgia reader asked us to dive deep into this costly claim and see whether McCallum’s numbers are on target. McCallum is running for the congressional seat currently held by Jack Kingston, a Republican from Savannah. Kingston is running for the U.S. Senate. McCallum once worked as a congressional aide for Newt Gingrich. McCallum was the GOP’s nominee for secretary of state in 1998 but lost that campaign to Cathy Cox. At first glance, McCallum’s figures seem way off. The U.S. Debt Clock, for example, says the debt per citizen is currently around $55,000. The current debt per taxpayer is slightly more than $150,000. So how did McCallum come up with this extremely higher estimate? A campaign official pointed us to the U.S. Senate Republican Committee on the Budget as the source of his claim. The committee’s website allows you to enter your birth date and it immediately computes your lifetime share of the national debt. For someone born on St. Patrick’s Day this year, the answer doesn’t seem lucky: $1,532,026. An official in the committee’s office sent us some information explaining how the estimate is calculated. A child born in 2014 is projected to have a life expectancy of 80. The committee used a population estimate of 598,933,000 for the United States in 80 years. Some estimates we’ve seen show estimates as high as 625 million by 2095. The total gross debt 80 years from now is assumed to be $917.58 trillion, for a lifetime share of debt at $1.532 million, if you use the committee’s population estimate. We checked how much the average debt would be if the U.S. population rose to 625 million by 2095. Our calculation was $1.47 million. McCallum’s estimate is based on a few assumptions. First, a child born today will live to 80. Second, the U.S. debt projection may change in 80 years, for better or worse. Third, the U.S. population may change in 80 years. It also assumes that Washington will not enact any legislation to meaningfully reduce the debt. Right now, there seems to be no viable legislative solution in sight. To sum up, McCallum said a child born today will inherit $1.5 million in federal debt. That’s about 10 times what the current debt is per taxpayer. McCallum’s claim is based on educated estimates of future projections that may change. With that caveat, we rate McCallum’s statement Mostly True.

pomt-01365	"Prayer rugs have recently been found on the Texas side of the border in the brush."	pants on fire!	/texas/statements/2014/oct/19/david-dewhurst/david-dewhurst-says-prayer-rugs-found-texas-brush-/	The lieutenant governor of Texas has twice declared the discovery of "prayer rugs" on the Texas side of the border with Mexico, also suggesting members of the Islamic State group have possibly snuck in. At the September 2014, Values Voter Summit in Washington, D.C., David Dewhurst described suspicions of an impending invasion of terrorists crossing the Rio Grande. As a sign, he said, "prayer rugs have recently been found on the Texas side of the border in the brush," according to CSPAN2 video posted online by the liberal news site Talking Points Memo. Of late, some Texas-Mexico border claims have lacked factual footing. In September 2014, PolitiFact rated Mostly False a claim the Islamic State group was operating in Ciudad Juárez, Chihuahua, Mexico. PolitiFact Texas subsequently rated Pants on Fire a California congressman’s statement that at least 10 ISIS fighters had been caught by the U.S. Border Patrol. So Dewhurst, who about a week earlier made a similar claim about prayer rugs in a border security panel discussion at the Texas Tribune Festival, made us wonder. For starters, scholars and Muslim religious figures we reached for this story warned against linking Muslim prayer to a person’s interest in terrorism. In themselves, experts said, the rugs -- like the ones pictured below in a photo emailed to us by Anees Siddiqui of Austin -- represent cleanliness; they’re placed on the ground where a Muslim believer prays. Also, the experts said, the rugs are not used by all the world’s estimated 1.6 billion Muslims. Courtesy photo: Anees Siddiqui, spokesman, the Islamic Center of Greater Austin. Dewhurst’s basis To our inquiry, Andrew Barlow, a state spokesman for Dewhurst, who lost his re-election bid this spring, emailed us two URLs and said, "Lt. Governor Dewhurst based his statement on this report: ...and this article." The latest provided account was a Sept. 11, 2014, online news report by KTRH, 740 AM in Houston, quoting Ed Turzanski, a former U.S. intelligence officer and professor of political science and government at La Salle University in Philadelphia, saying: "We've seen Muslim prayer rugs and other items that have been left behind by people entering the country illegally." By phone, Turzanski told us Border Patrol agents, in numerous private conversations over the past decade, told him prayer rugs were found at the border, but it’s been "a number of years" since the last report. He also offered to try to put knowledgeable sources in touch with us; we heard no more. Otherwise, he warned, government agencies would not admit prayer rug discoveries to the press. He said officials in President Barack Obama’s administration forbid the Border Patrol from speaking about anything that "goes against the administration’s border security narrative." The other news story Barlow noted, posted June 30, 2014, on Breitbart.com, a conservative news and commentary website, quoted an unidentified "source who works among independent American security contractors along the southern border in Arizona and Texas" saying six Middle Easterners had been picked up in Laredo, Texas, "right along (the area) with the ranchers in Texas finding prayer rugs in their ranches." After we tried to contact the Breitbart reporter, Kerry Picket, Kurt Bardella, president of Endeavor Strategic Communications, the firm that runs public relations for Breitbart, said by phone Breitbart could not reveal the source who described the prayer rug discoveries. He also said the organization could not tell us what group the source belongs to, where the source lives or why the source believed the ranchers’ findings were prayer rugs. Bardella said: "The source stands by his statement." Other accounts and authorities Via the Nexis news database, we spotted news reports of prayer rugs found along the border as long ago as 2005. None of the reports presented on-the-record sourced-by-name evidence. Separately, federal and local law enforcement authorities denied receiving reports of found prayer rugs while Tom Vinger, spokesman for the Texas Department of Public Safety, emailed us that the agency doesn’t track that information. By phone, Joe Gutierrez Jr., spokesman for the Border Patrol’s Rio Grande Valley Sector, said he had heard "nothing" about prayer rug finds. Gutierrez said he passed our query on to all Texas Border Patrol sectors by email. A response came from Rod Kise, a public information officer at the Rio Grande Valley Sector headquarters in Edinburg. Kise emailed: "Regarding the discovery of prayer rugs along the Texas-Mexico Border, we had no reports of prayer rugs being found." Kise also said: "It is not unusual to find trash/etc. along smuggling routes." By email, Nick Georgiou, managing editor of the Laredo Morning Times, said the newspaper "is not aware of any reports of Muslim prayer rugs found near the Texas-Mexico border around Laredo." To our inquiry, Brenda Medina-Moreno, a Laredo spokeswoman for the Webb County sheriff’s office, said by email: "The Webb County Sheriff’s Office has not come across any prayer rugs and/or reports of the rugs along our border crossings." Experts: Photograph not a prayer rug Amid unnamed-source reports of prayer rug findings, we found only one article presenting a photo of an alleged prayer rug found on the border in Arizona. The July 9, 2014, news story was written for Breitbart.com by Picket, who also wrote the story on prayer rugs found by ranchers near Laredo, Texas that Dewhurst relied on. By email, Breitbart spokesman Bardella pointed out an editor’s note attached to the end of the July 2014 story. The note said: "We reasonably relied on the statements and picture provided by a third-party source regarding the finding of an apparent prayer shawl at the border. There are now conflicting reports about those statements; however, the third party source still fully stands behind the accuracy of his original account." To get our own sense of the photo’s accuracy, we sent a copy of the photograph and a request for analysis to over a dozen U.S. religious figures and scholars. We received eight replies, with all the respondents saying the pictured item did not look like a prayer rug. Frank Griffel, chairman of the Council of Middle East Studies at Yale University, said: "Is this a joke? What makes people think that the vague cloth at the border is a prayer rug? I can't see any connection. It's an old piece of cloth and it has no resemblance to a rug, even less so to a prayer rug." Samer Ali, associate professor of Middle Eastern Studies at the University of Texas, said it didn’t look like a prayer rug because it was too thin, had seams, had hems and didn’t look like any design he’d seen on a prayer rug. Mustafa Umar, director of education and outreach at the Islamic Institute of Orange County in California, said: "The checkered pattern is not characteristic of a prayer rug and was in fact discouraged by the Prophet Muhammad to use because that pattern distracts the Muslim from prayer." Our ruling Dewhurst said "prayer rugs have recently been found" in brush on the Texas side of the U.S.-Mexico border. This claim is weakened because it’s not backed up by sourced-by-name witnesses nor did any authority confirm such a find when we inquired. If prayer rugs were showing up to someone’s alarm, we think there'd be legitimate photographs and the rugs themselves available for inspection. Another hole: While people of the Muslim faith surely cross the Mexico-Texas border – that’s not at issue in this fact check – it’s unreasonable to presume the presence of prayer rugs means individuals carrying them intend to commit violent acts on U.S.soil, an implication of Dewhurst’s declaration. In the end, we find his statement incorrect and ridiculous. Rugs (we mean Pants) on Fire!	None	David Dewhurst	None	None	None	2014-10-19T06:00:00	2014-09-26	['Texas']
pomt-06288	A DeKalb sewer project "will create up to 4,000 direct jobs per year at peak production, many of which will be set aside exclusively for DeKalb residents."	mostly true	/georgia/statements/2011/nov/21/dekalb-county/county-claims-sewer-work-will-create-4000-jobs/	DeKalb County has peered deep into its sewers and found a trove of jobs. The county needs $1.35 billion in water system upgrades to replace mains, aging tanks, and build or repair other infrastructure. Through its recently-announced ONE DeKalb Works program, which they bill as a "local stimulus program," they hope to keep many of those contracts and jobs in the county. "As a result of these ground-breaking partnerships, ONE DeKalb Works will create up to 4,000 direct jobs per year at peak production, many of which will be set aside exclusively for DeKalb residents," the program’s brochure said. Oh, job estimates. We’ve tackled them many times before. The numbers are typically miscast or overstated. We can’t resist a job estimate. We switched on our Truth-O-Meter let it spin away. According to county documents, the program will work like this: DeKalb County’s Department of Watershed Management plans to upgrade its water system from 2013 through 2017. The county’s First Source ordinance, which was updated this year, requires all contractors with contracts worth $50,000 or more to make a "good faith effort" to fill half of the jobs their projects create with DeKalb residents, it says DeKalb Workforce Development, a division of the county that helps job seekers get training and connects businesses with applicants, keeps a list of pre-screened workers that contractors can use to find qualified candidates. Contractors who don’t make a good faith effort to reach the 50 percent goal may become ineligible for future projects. The National Urban League will monitor four of these contracts as part of a pilot project to make sure contractors comply with the ordinance. The League will have the authority to check contractor payroll records, and will report on how well contractors are meeting county hiring goals. Since the revised ordinance went into effect in late summer, DeKalb has referred 149 possible employees to 65 contractors who won their bids, county spokesman Burke Brennan said. The county has confirmed contractors hired seven of them, but it’s still collecting data. So it’s accurate to say that DeKalb has an ordinance that requires contractors try its best to hire a certain amount of locals. The county also has specific plans to monitor contractors and sanctions in place should contractors violate the statute. But saying that these jobs will be available "exclusively" for DeKalb residents is a bit of an overstatement. Contractors must simply make a good faith effort. Now on to the ONE DeKalb Works’ job estimates. They were issued by the University of Georgia Carl Vinson Institute of Government, which often generates economic impact studies. We looked at their study and found they used two standard, widely-accepted models. The study calculated how many "direct" jobs the project will create. These positions are for people working directly on improving the county’s water system. Each job equals one position lasting for one year. It also estimated "indirect" jobs, which are created when the county purchases materials for the project, and "induced" jobs, which is when workers create jobs by using their earnings to buy clothes or lunch and the like. The average reader often looks at job estimates for a major project and gets the impression that they represent jobs for people who are actually building it. In fact, some governments add direct jobs to indirect and induced jobs to get the totals that they release to the press. This can give an inflated sense of how many jobs a project will create. Another mistake is governments sometimes add together the number of jobs per year created in each each year of the project. This can artificially inflate job numbers as well. For instance, if a project lasts for five years, and a particular worker is set to work on it for all five years, his one job would count as five jobs under this method. DeKalb avoids these problems, by and large. In information that accompanies the brochure online, it lists jobs for each year separately. It doesn’t add direct, indirect and induced jobs together. When work is in full swing in 2015, there will be 3,670 jobs assigned to work directly on the sewer project, according to one economic impact model. Using the second model, UGA found that number is 4,170 direct, indirect and induced jobs in DeKalb county. "We can be fairly sure that the impact in DeKalb County is somewhere between the two estimates and the actual impact will be determined by the amount of materials purchased from firms in the county," the UGA report concludes. Overall, DeKalb does well with its jobs claim. We think it’s reasonable, if optimistic, to say "up to" 4,000 jobs directly will created by the project when it’s at its peak. The county does run into a little trouble when it claims some of the ONE DeKalb Works jobs are set aside "exclusively" for locals. This overstatement would be a serious concern, given that DeKalb has only confirmed that seven workers have been hired under the current First Source rules. But it’s not a serious concern in this case. The First Source ordinance is brand new and the county is still collecting hire data.

pomt-07207	Michigan and Massachusetts raised their bottle deposit and "could no longer afford the program because the redemptions were so high there was no profit in there."	pants on fire!	/oregon/statements/2011/jun/06/jeff-kruse/state-senator-says-two-states-bottle-bill-systems-/	The Oregon Senate recently gave final approval to a bill that widely expands Oregon’s iconic bottle bill. Among other things, the legislation increases the sorts of beverages covered and leaves room for a possible increase from the current nickel deposit to a dime. It’s that last bit, the five to ten cents bit, that drew the strongEST rebuke from dissenting senators. The increase happens only if the return rate in Oregon dips below 80 percent two years in a row. Distributors don’t think that will happen. In fact, they’re so sure they can keep rates high that they endorsed the bill. But some Republican senators didn’t see how that made any sense. If proponents were so certain redemption rates wouldn’t fall, why bother including that provision in the bill at all? Sen. Jeff Kruse was among those who spoke against that piece of the expansion. "We have some unintended consequences that may come in with this increase to a dime … I would point to a couple states -- Michigan and Massachusetts -- that increased their redemption value and what happened in both of those states is they could no longer afford the program because the redemptions were so high there was no profit in there," he told his colleagues. His reasoning as far as we could tell -- and he later confirmed -- was that those states had such high redemption rates, the deposit money mostly got refunded and that left the states no money to run their programs. That’s a pretty dire prognosis: The program could work so well that it would eliminate its own funding stream. PolitiFact Oregon decided to check it out. First up was Michigan. We talked to Terry Stanton, the spokesman for the state’s Department of Treasury. Michigan’s deposit, he said, was indeed 10 cents -- the highest in the nation -- and the return rate was nearly 97 percent. (For comparison, Oregon is just under 80 percent.) Does the high redemption cause problems? Is the Michigan system going broke? At first, Stanton didn’t seem to understand what we were asking. The idea that the bottle redemption program was a way to raise funds and not to encourage recycling just didn’t seem right. "I don't know," he said. "That wasn't the purpose of the program … This was initiated really to clean up the road waste." Right, we said. Same with Oregon. But here, the unclaimed deposits help run the system. If there aren’t any, the system might face problems. We asked again: Is that happening in Michigan. He checked and sent us this e-mail: "First, as noted on the phone, Michigan's bottle deposit law was put in place in the 1970's, to help cleanup roadsides, etc., that were becoming cluttered with bottles and cans. The deposit has been at 10 cents since inception. Michigan's program, which was approved by a vote of the people, was not designed to be a revenue generator but to keep roadsides and the environment clean. ... "As for the unredeemed cans, the Michigan Bottle Deposit Law states that of the unclaimed deposits that revert to the state, 75 percent is deposited into the Cleanup and Redevelopment Trust Fund and 25 percent is returned to the retailers. ... "I'm not sure what the individual in Oregon is claiming as far as ‘not having the money to operate.’ As far as I'm aware, Michigan's program is not experiencing problems." Well, that didn’t seem to match very well with what Kruse had said. So, we gave him a call and asked where he’d heard that Michigan was going broke. "I don't have documentation," Kruse said, adding it came from "a discussion we were having." "The logic behind it is that the program pays for itself by those (deposits) that aren't returned. So, if you get to the point where you're getting 100 percent" there’s no fuel for the program, Kruse said. "I guess i was trying to make the point that this move, if we got back to the dime, could come back to bite us in a way that we did not anticipate." Then, he added that the deposit might be even higher in Massachusetts -- even a quarter. Maybe there were issues there. We did some Googling (we’re hi-tech here) and couldn’t find anything about a quarter deposit there. We did find a few articles about an expansion included in the Massachusetts governor’s proposal, but that dealt only with the types of containers included. There wasn’t a word about an increase from a nickel to a quarter. But we like to be complete in our fact-checking, so we gave the Massachusetts Department of Environmental Protection a call. We talked to Edmund Coletta, the spokesman for the department, about the latest on the state’s deposit system. The bottle deposit, he confirmed, was still a nickel. The governor recently pushed to get more beverage containers included under the program, he said, but neither the state’s House nor Senate included the changes in their budget proposals. What’s more, he added, increasing the current nickel deposit is "definitely not in the governor’s proposal." For a final word on all this, we decided to give John Anderson a call. He’s the president of the Oregon Beverage Recycling Cooperative, the group that’s helping to expand redemption centers through the state. We asked him whether Kruse might be on to something. Could an increased deposit lead to a collapse in Oregon’s system? While it’s true, he said, that unredeemed deposits "are the major funding for the system" it’s unlikely that, even with a dime, we’d hit Michigan’s 97 percent return rate. Part of that has to do with the fact that Michigan is surrounded by major out-of-state population centers. That "Seinfeld" episode about Kramer taking empties from New York to Michigan for the double deposit? That actually happens. But Oregon only has Vancouver nearby. So even at 10 cents, "we end up about in the high 80s, that's my estimate," Anderson said. "I think we lose on redeemed deposits, but I don't think we go into a crisis mode. "I don't think that's a problem that we really need to spend a lot of time on." This case seems pretty open and shut to us. Kruse tried to persuade his Senate colleagues that too-high deposits in Michigan and Massachusetts were crippling those programs. But Michigan says that’s not the case and Massachusetts doesn’t even have a higher deposit rate. Kruse doesn’t have any evidence to back up his claim. The statement is not just false -- it’s ridiculous. We rate it Pants on Fire.	None	Jeff Kruse	None	None	None	2011-06-06T06:00:00	2011-05-25	['Michigan', 'Massachusetts']
pomt-12800	On using the Common Core standards for English and math instruction	full flop	/wisconsin/statements/2017/feb/15/john-humphries/humphries-changed-course-common-core-standards/	Two candidates in the Feb. 21, 2017 primary election for state superintendent of public instruction are in a race to replace. Replace the Common Core academic standards, that is. Their stances have earned Lowell Holtz and John Humphries the label of "flip floppers" from the liberal advocacy group One Wisconsin Now. We decided to turn to the Flip-O-Meter to determine if the challengers to incumbent Superintendent Tony Evers -- a Common Core supporter -- merit that label. Adopted by many states, the kindergarten-to-12th grade standards were designed as a rigorous national effort that would base teaching on college and job-world needs and allow comparison of U.S. students to their international counterparts. In Wisconsin most school districts, if not all, have adopted Common Core as the standards for English and math, said Thomas McCarthy, spokesman for the state Department of Public Instruction. The Flip-O-Meter, of course, does not rate whether it’s good policy or politics to switch a position. It simply measures consistency in positions over time. Some argue a change demonstrates an openness to new facts or a willingness to compromise. Others say it is evidence of inconsistent principles or lack of backbone. So, where does Humphries stand? Humphries then Before the election, Humphries’ views on Common Core can be found in letters he wrote on behalf of the Wisconsin School Psychologists Association. He was president-elect. It’s an imperfect source because the communications don’t necessarily represent his personal views. But he personalized one of the letters using his own experience and has not said he disagreed with their content. In October 2013, the group praised Common Core to a task force considering implementation of the standards. The "higher, better" standards were developed with a broad coalition and should go into effect quickly, the letter said. "There is broad agreement on the positive impact they have had already. I have seen firsthand the significant, positive impact these new standards have had on our work in schools," Humphries wrote. Humphries told the task force that he was a school psychology consultant for the state Department of Public Instruction before returning to the schools in 2011, working in Dodgeville as a school psychologist and director of special education and pupil services. The Common Core has required educators to refocus their efforts, he wrote: "In Dodgeville for example, our staff spent hundreds of hours this summer re-working our curricula in order to align with the new, higher standards." The letter offered some specific criticisms of Common Core, but said it should be the "baseline" for any new standards. In March 2014, Humphries and two other officials with the group expressed concerns about proposed state legislation to dump Common Core and start from scratch to develop new standards. New standards could be less rigorous and take Wisconsin out of the national conversation on educational outcomes, the letter warned, because more time and national expertise would be needed if Wisconsin started over. Rather, the authors wrote, the state should improve and clarify some areas of Common Core, then provide money to put the "Wisconsin Common Core Extension Standards" into effect. Humphries now Jump ahead to February 2017. On the campaign trail, Humphries said he wanted to "replace" Common Core. The standards, he said, are too weak. Instead, the state should take two years to develop new standards with state and national expertise. Good intentions have frequently turned to poor implementation, inadequate communication, and too many decisions being taken away from parents and educators by state and federal politicians, Humphries said in a campaign news release in February 2017. Humphries’ praise of Common Core had been criticized by some conservatives, and his rollout of a "repeal" was greeted skeptically Feb. 2, 2017 by talk show host Jerry Bader in an appearance on that show. On that show, Humphries said he disagreed that the 2013-’14 letters were supportive of Common Core. Our rating It’s tempting to call this a Half Flip given that the 2013-14 correspondence wasn’t entirely praiseworthy of Common Core. And there’s the problem that Humphries was speaking for hundreds of psychologists, not just himself. But in our view Humphries downplays and miscasts those letters instead of distancing himself from the positions expressed. And the contrast is vivid: Common Core was strong, now it’s too weak. Common Core is needed right away, now we can wait two years. Common Core should be the baseline, now it should be dumped. That’s a major reversal. And a Full Flop.

pomt-07718	Says the Army is spending $7 million to sponsor a NASCAR team.	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/mar/03/betty-mccollum/rep-betty-mccollum-argues-against-army-funding-nas/	Rep. Betty McCollum says the government wastes a remarkable amount of money sponsoring a NASCAR team -- $7 million a year. "In 2011, the U.S. Army is sponsoring Ryan Newman's #39 Chevrolet Impala in the Spirit Cup series at a cost to the taxpayers of $7 million," McCollum, D-Minn., said in a statement. A reader wondered whether this was true, so we looked into it. The NASCAR sponsorship was cited many times during the recent House of Representatives deliberations on budget cuts. During one round of budget-cutting in February 2011, the House voted to slice more than $61 billion from the budget, but it spared the money that the Army pays to sponsor Newman's NASCAR team. The Army has sponsored various NASCAR teams for many years and has sponsored Newman's for the past two years. Backers of the expenditure say sponsorship pays off in recruiting leads. "Last year alone, the U.S. Army's motor sports programs generated more than 46,000 qualified leads, more than 1,300 pledges of support from key business and community leaders, and more than 484 million media impressions (34 million of which offered specific Army recruiting messages)," said Newman in a website discussion. A spokesman for Stewart-Haas Racing confirmed that the Army pays $7.4 million for its co-sponsorship. The team's website quotes Newman saying that he is energized by the sponsorship. "Being around the U.S. Army soldiers is an inspiration to me and the race team," he said. "The physical, emotional and mental strength of these individuals is a driving force behind our mission to get the soldier’s car into Victory Lane." But to McCollum the sponsorship is too much. "Taxpayer-funded NASCAR race cars are an absurdity at a time when the Republican-Tea Party is cutting federal support for homeless veterans, law enforcement officers, and firefighters," McCollum said in a press release announcing her proposed amendment. "With trillion dollar deficits, this amendment is where the rubber meets the road for my Republican Tea Party colleagues," she said. But her amendment failed. We won't weigh in on the debate over whether the Army's money is well spent or not. When it comes to the dollars, though, McCollum is on the mark, so we rate this statement True. Editor's note: In an earlier version, the name of Stewart-Haas Racing was misspelled.	None	Betty McCollum	None	None	None	2011-03-03T14:25:44	2011-02-16	['None']
pomt-00343	Says "Mike Madigan and Kwame Raoul team up to raise property taxes."	mostly false	/illinois/statements/2018/sep/16/erika-harold/republican-ag-candidate-misleads-attacking-opponen/	Complaining about corruption and high property taxes is the low-hanging fruit of election politics in Illinois, and Republican attorney general candidate Erika Harold hits on both in a recent ad targeting her Democratic opponent, state Sen. Kwame Raoul of Chicago. The TV spot starts off with Harold stating, "In Illinois, politicians have turned corruption into an art form." "I’m Erika Harold and this scheme is one of the worst: Mike Madigan and Kwame Raoul team up to raise property taxes," she continues, as a picture of the Democratic House Speaker and Raoul flashes on-screen with text characterizing their collaboration as a "scheme." "In Chicago, Madigan’s business does property tax appeals for the powerful," she goes on to say. "Higher taxes, higher profits. And Kwame Raoul? His top donor gets massive tax breaks from the county, while you get higher taxes. I’m Erika Harold. As attorney general, I’ll make the politicians pay for their corruption—not you." Harold’s ad contains a hodgepodge of accusations and innuendo, including that reference to Madigan’s property tax business to which Raoul has no connection. Yet it’s all framed around a central implication that Raoul and Madigan somehow participated in a corrupt "scheme" to line their pockets by hiking property taxes. That makes her statement about the two teaming up to raise property taxes much more provocative. So we decided to give it a closer look. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com Missing context Harold’s ad refers to a 2014 bill sponsored by Raoul in the Senate and Madigan in the House that sought to get two of Chicago’s ailing pension funds for city workers back on financial track. The measure was aimed at facilitating a plan of Mayor Rahm Emanuel’s to reduce a multibillion-dollar pension shortfall by cutting city worker retirement benefits and requiring both workers and the city to increase contributions into the municipal and laborers’ pension funds. Then-Gov. Pat Quinn, as well as lawmakers from both parties, quickly objected to language in the bill Quinn said would "gouge" city property owners. Within days, Raoul, Madigan and Emanuel pulled that language. The watered-down bill eventually passed and was signed into law by Quinn, though it was later struck down as unconstitutional by the Illinois Supreme Court. Harold campaign spokesman Aaron DeGroot acknowledged Raoul and Madigan carried the bill at Emanuel’s request and that they removed the property tax provision before its passage. Even so, DeGroot said the context was immaterial. "The reason they all sought the property tax is irrelevant," DeGroot wrote in an email. "We never claim property taxes were raised as a result of the legislation. We do say, though, that Raoul and Madigan endorsed a property tax increase. That is true. The additional context or final result does not make that fact any less true." Without that context, however, Harold’s accusations amount to cleverly misleading wordplay. By stating that Raoul and Madigan teamed up "to" raise property taxes, she erroneously implies that raising taxes was the proposal’s central aim. What’s more, among those speaking in favor of the bill on the day it passed in the House was the chamber’s Republican leader, Jim Durkin. "Doing nothing is not an option," he said, later adding "I don’t want to see the city of Chicago fall in line with Detroit." "The sponsors were acting in response to the city’s request to change the state law," said Amanda Kass, associate director of the Government Finance Research Center at the University of Illinois-Chicago. "Everybody recognized the city’s contributions were too low." Not a "scheme" There’s another reason context is critical in making sense of Harold’s property-tax claim: the on-screen text reiterating that Raoul and Madigan’s proposal was a "scheme" right after she’d called it "one of the worst" in the sordid history of public corruption in Illinois. Framing the bill that way suggests Raoul used his public office for personal gain. There is no evidence for such a claim, and Harold’s campaign did not attempt to support it when we asked for proof. Instead, DeGroot argued Raoul is complicit in what he described as Illinois’ "inherently corrupt" property tax system, contending he’s not only supported property tax increases but has also "been silent on reform." As for the allegation about Raoul’s top donor benefitting from lucrative tax breaks, that was a reference to Neil Bluhm, chairman of Rivers Casino in Des Plaines as well as the finance chair of Raoul’s campaign. In making the charge, Harold’s ad cites a 2016 investigation by the Better Government Association that showed how Rivers had received lucrative property tax breaks after appeals filed with Cook County Assessor Joe Berrios. The article made no reference to Raoul, and DeGroot did not say the Democrat was involved with the Rivers tax break. "We say Raoul’s top donor was the recipient of a million-dollar tax break," DeGroot wrote. "Nothing more." Our ruling Harold says "Mike Madigan and Kwame Raoul team up to raise property taxes." Her statement contains an element of truth in that Raoul and Madigan did sponsor legislation in 2014 that initially contained a proposal from Emanuel for a new property tax levy for several ailing pension funds. But the tax component was not the primary aim of the bill, which also sought to shore up the funds by cutting city worker retirement benefits and requiring both workers and the city to put more money into them. That tax language didn’t even make it into the final version of the bill. Yet Harold’s claim spuriously suggests Raoul teamed up with Madigan for the express purpose of hiking taxes, leaving out all mitigating context. We rate it Mostly False.

pomt-00932	Georgia’s share of money from the Federal Highway Trust Fund declined 12 percent between 2008 and 2013.	true	/georgia/statements/2015/feb/25/associated-press/report-accurate-decline-federal-transportation-dol/	Georgia lawmakers are struggling to come up with $1 billion annually for road and bridge work, and they see nothing to suggest Uncle Sam will be lending much help -- let alone extra money. For decades, states have been receiving money each year from the Federal Highway Trust Fund. But those dollars have been shrinking of late for all but Alaska and New York. Last weekend, The Associated Press published a national analysis of Federal Highway Trust Fund spending between 2008 and 2013, the latest year for which figures were available. It showed overall trust fund money to the states was down 3.5 percent during that period. Based on population, Georgia saw the third sharpest decline in awards for the period -- down 12 percent. Only Minnesota and Washington took bigger hits, AP reported. With transportation a top issue to Atlanta commuters and business leaders and one of the hottest topics of debate in this year’s General Assembly session, PolitiFact Georgia decided to dig a little deeper. First, a little background on the trust fund, its history and its role in the angst playing out under Georgia’s Gold Dome and in other state capitols. Congress funded construction of interstates and some other roads through the general fund until 1956 when the Federal Highway Trust Fund was established, using proceeds from the federal fuel tax of 18.3 cents a gallon on gasoline and 24.4 cents a gallon on diesel fuel and related excise taxes. The trust fund had an $8 billion shortfall in 2008, attributed to higher gas prices and lower gas consumption driven by the recession, that had to be covered with money from the general fund. Similarly, $7 billion had to be transferred to the fund in 2009, and $19.5 billion in 2010. Congress passed a stopgap plan last year to prevent a funding lapse, and the trust fund could again be on the chopping block in May without intervention. Some states have responded by proposing new taxes, tolls and fees. Leaders in the Georgia House have proposed a bill to raise $1 billion for transportation, an issue they acknowledge is critical to the state’s long-term growth. The plan’s backers also say it will decrease Georgia’s reliance on federal funding for road upkeep. In 2014, about $1.2 billion, or more than 54 percent of the state DOT budget came from federal funds. "The more independent we can be from the federal government, the better off we are long term," Seth Millican, director of the Georgia Transportation Alliance, an arm of the Georgia Chamber of Commerce, said last week. Mick Bullock, spokesman for the National Conference of State Legislatures, said transportation funding is "an issue states are grappling with all around the country. "Pending what happens in Congress with the Highway Trust Fund, state legislatures need a long-term funding solution for their transportation infrastructure," Bullock said. ‘if Congress does not act, states will have to look at other funding solutions." Now to the numbers. The Georgia Department of Transportation provided us with data on the sizable dollars that flowed to road projects in the state from the federal trust fund in the period that had been reviewed. Georgia received $8.14 billion in 2008 to 2013 -- including (with rounding) $1.44 billion in 2008; $1.36 billion in 2009; $1.4 billion in 2010; $1.37 billion in 2011; $1.3 billion in 2012 and $1.27 billion in 2013. By our calculations, that was a net loss of about 12 percent. We asked for data for the five prior years -- thinking that might provide additional light. In the five prior years, we saw the state’s annual allotment from the trust fund go up almost every year, (with rounding) $1 billion in 2003; $1.22 billion in 2004; $1.27 billion in 2005; $1.23 million in 2006; and $1.34 billion in 2007. Overall, in that period, Georgia’s funding through the trust fund increased at a steady clip -- about 34 percent. Our ruling. The money Georgia receives from the Federal Highway Trust Fund fell by more than 12 percent in 2008 through 2013. State and federal data we reviewed backs up that finding by The Associated Press. We rate the statement True.	None	The Associated Press	None	None	None	2015-02-25T00:00:00	2015-02-21	['None']
pomt-15336	For African-Americans between the ages of 17 and 20, "the real unemployment rate … is 51 percent."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/jul/13/bernie-sanders/bernie-sanders-says-real-unemployment-rate-african/	During a campaign event in Portland, Maine, that attracted thousands of supporters, Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders made a striking claim about unemployment among African-American youth. "For young people who have graduated high school or dropped out of high school, who are between the ages of 17 and 20, if they happen to be white, the unemployment rate is 33 percent," he said. "If they are Hispanic, the unemployment rate is 36 percent. If they are African-American, the real unemployment rate for young people is 51 percent." A reader asked us to check whether Sanders was correct, so we took a closer look. (Sanders seems to have made this a go-to talking point in his campaign; he offered a similar claim in an interview with The Nation.) We’ll start by noting that the most commonly used unemployment-rate statistic is not as high for each group as Sanders indicated. The most readily available data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics covers the age range from 16 to 19, which isn’t identical but gives a quick approximation. For whites in that age range, the official unemployment rate was 15.7 percent, for Hispanics it was 20.8 percent and for African-Americans it was 31.8 percent. In other words, the official unemployment rate shows the same general pattern -- that African-American youth unemployment is significantly higher than white youth unemployment and, to a lesser extent, higher than Hispanic youth unemployment. Still, the levels for each group are lower than what Sanders said. So what’s going on? Sanders’ camp pointed us to research by the Economic Policy Institute, a left-of-center think tank. This data is different from the more familiar measurements for a few reasons. One, the institute didn’t just look at employment status for people between the ages of 17 and 20; it limited its reach to high school graduates who were not enrolled in further schooling. And two, EPI counted not only unemployed workers but also those who were working part-time due to the weakness of the economy and those who were "marginally attached to the labor force." The latter category includes people who did not meet the strict definition of being in the job market, but weren’t entirely out of the market, either. The statistic EPI used, known by the wonky shorthand U-6, is officially called a measure of "labor underutilization" rather than "unemployment." EPI itself used the term "underemployment" in its research. It’s a real statistic, but Sanders didn’t really describe it the correct way. He twice used the term "unemployment rate" and once used the variation "real unemployment rate," a vague term that doesn’t have any official definition at BLS and wasn’t mentioned in the EPI research he was quoting. On the other hand, Sanders’ choice of statistics actually understated his broader point. Since it’s reasonable to assume that dropouts have an even higher unemployment rate than high-school graduates, the figure for "young people who have graduated high school or dropped out of high school," as he put it, is probably even higher than 51 percent, since that figure includes only high school graduates. All in all, economists agreed that Sanders had a point despite his problems with terminology. "He should have been clearer," said Tara Sinclair, a George Washington University economist. "But I think the overall scale is right. Both education and race are predictive of employment outcomes in the United States. A number of different studies show that even for the same levels of education, minorities appear to have worse average employment outcomes." Our ruling Sanders said that for African-Americans between the ages of 17 and 20, "the real unemployment rate … is 51 percent." His terminology was off, but the numbers he used check out, and his general point was correct -- that in an apples-to-apples comparison, African-American youth have significantly worse prospects in the job market than either Hispanics or whites do. The statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information, so we rate it Mostly True.	None	Bernie Sanders	None	None	None	2015-07-13T15:39:42	2015-07-06	['None']
pomt-09613	Says Rick Perry's "Pay to Play" politics led him to send $899 million to an offshore call center in Bermuda, driving down enrollment in children's health insurance	false	/texas/statements/2010/jan/15/texas-democratic-party/democrats-say-perry-sent-899-million-offshore-call/	As Gov. Rick Perry questioned efforts by congressional Democrats to pass a health care overhaul, the Texas Democratic Party accused him of undermining Texans' care with policies that benefit private companies instead of citizens. "Perry's 'Pay to Play' politics led him to send $899 million to an offshore call center in Bermuda — a privatization scheme that deeply cost Texas taxpayers and resulted in 237,000 children losing their health insurance through CHIP," according to an Oct. 5 party news release. CHIP stands for Children's Health Insurance Program, which serves children of the working poor. The specter of needy Texans forced to seek assistance from operators in Bermuda — causing more than 200,000 children to lose their insurance coverage — seemed shocking. We wondered if the Democrats' charge was true. The Democrats' news release cited a 2007 article by the San Antonio Express-News.We couldn't find anything in the Express-News article to back up the fiery claim. A party activist quickly admitted at least partial error. Phillip Martin of the Texas Democratic Trust, which helps the party, said the press release was worded incorrectly. "The call centers obviously weren't in Bermuda," Martin said, "but the company was based in Bermuda — so Texas taxpayers' money did go to a company in Bermuda." The state had hired Accenture, a consulting and outsourcing company, to lead a group of companies called the Texas Access Alliance that would field social service applications and enroll clients. Accenture LLP, the U.S. subsidiary of Accenture Ltd., was incorporated in Bermuda in 2001, though shareholders voted last year to move the place of incorporation to Ireland. But CHIP phone calls haven't been going to either country. In fact, they're answered in Texas. We learned from the Health and Human Services Commission that the state's contract with Accenture required call-center employees to work from U.S. locations. The centers, located in Austin, San Antonio, Midland and Athens (the city near Tyler in East Texas — not Greece), have been run by Virgina-based Maximus, which signed a contract with the state when Accenture's role ended in June 2007. Commission spokeswoman Stephanie Goodman said: "The only way a call could be sent out of state is if a catastrophic situation happened that took down all the phone lines." In a broader context, the Democrats’ Martin suggested the creation of the call centers still was part of a Republican-fostered privatization scheme driving down CHIP sign-ups. Martin’s point: In 2003, the GOP-led Legislature made a push for privatization. Part of that involved directing the HHSC to determine whether using call centers run by private firms would cut costs. Kirsten Gray, Democratic Party communications director, explained that "'Pay to Play' is a political term of art," which we assume means Perry's politics are inspired by whoever coughs up enough money toward his career. He did sign HB 2292 — the legislation that ushered sweeping changes into the state's health and human services — but Rep. Arlene Wohlgemuth authored the bill, and the Legislature passed it. Accenture later landed the state’s call-center contract, which was projected to cost $899 million over five years, the cost figure cited by the Democrats. The privately run call centers were set up to process applications for CHIP, food stamps and Medicaid. Accenture ended up getting $245 million because Maximus took over the call centers. We made a run at gauging whether the creation of the call centers alone reduced CHIP participation, as the Democrats claimed. It’s just not so. True, during the two years that Accenture was employed by the state, CHIP caseloads decreased and applications were lost in the system, causing children to lose health coverage. But those numbers first dropped before the Accenture contract — after lawmakers approved policy changes restricting enrollment. For instance, an amendment adopted in the 2003 legislative session required clients to re-enroll every six months instead of 12 — a reduced time-frame intended to keep children from staying in the program past the time that their parents’ income surged. However, that resulted in more children being dropped from the rolls because their parents failed to re-enroll in time. CHIP sign-ups rebounded a bit after legislators restored the 12-month enrollment period in 2007. Anne Dunkelberg, associate director of the Center for Public Policy Priorities, which advocates for low-income Texans, summed up: "The state implemented some really, really ill-considered policy changes, all at the same time." She said that a combination of policy changes, privatization and staffing cuts all contributed to CHIP reductions, but it's impossible to blame any one factor for CHIP reductions. True, privatizing oversight of CHIP may not have delivered hoped-for savings, and enrollment may have been reduced. But the Democrats' claim that Perry sent nearly $900 million to an outfit in Bermuda, directly causing more than 200,000 children to lose their health coverage, amounted to a big overreach. If they'd been more careful — even saying that the call centers were part of a troubled privatized model — our analysis may have been different. But the party misstated the facts, undermining what could have been a meaningful critique. We rule the statement False.

pomt-07926	"No one in the private sector gets unlimited accruals of vacation and sick leave."	half-true	/florida/statements/2011/jan/28/ed-turanchik/ed-turanchik-says-no-one-private-sector-gets-unlim/	Think government workers get gold-plated benefits packages? Tampa mayoral candidate Ed Turanchik does. His campaign platform calls for stopping unlimited accumulations of vacation and sick days and taking a long look at the city's pay scales. He told the weekly publication Creative Loafing in the Dec. 10, 2010, issue that, "No one in the private sector gets unlimited accruals of vacation and sick leave. That's gotta be changed." We wanted to know, can Tampa's city workers collect unlimited vacation and sick time? And are such practices extinct at private companies? Tampa’s policy We first turned to Tampa's personnel manual for guidance. Full-time workers get about 12 vacation days per year, plus extra days depending on how long the person has worked for the city. A 20-year employee earns seven extra days, for example. Workers also receive 12 days of sick leave, but don't get extra days based on seniority. Employees can save their vacation time and carry up to six weeks to the next year. Additional vacation time gets converted to sick days, which have more restrictions than vacation time. Workers can carry forward as much sick leave as they want. (Tampa has four contracts that cover union workers, police officers, firefighters and all other employees. Each contract is different, but the vacation and sick leave policies are largely consistent.) Asked on Jan. 25 about his description of Tampa's benefits package, Turanchik noted that retiring workers are paid for their unused vacation time (up to the six-week cap) and for half of their unused sick days. Even though vacation time is capped, he said, extra days are converted to sick leave and can eventually be cashed out at the lower rate. "It grows and grows and grows," he said. So Turanchik is mostly correct about Tampa's policy. Combining vacation and sick leave, an employee can accumulate unlimited paid time off. But vacation days are capped and additional time is counted as sick leave, which is harder to use and less lucrative upon retirement. Tampa is mostly in line with other large area cities, though it's the only major city with unlimited sick leave. Both St. Petersburg and Clearwater cap vacation and sick days. Retiring St. Petersburg city workers can cash out almost five months of unused time off, while their Clearwater counterparts get a little more than five months. (That figure was cut by about a third for newer Clearwater hires.) Tampa vs. the private sector It turns out that policies similar to Tampa's are somewhat common in the private sector, according to several studies of employee benefits packages. The New Jersey-based employment law think tank Alexander Hamilton Institute surveyed 1,193 companies about their benefits. Roughly three-fifths of the businesses have traditional vacation plans such as Tampa's. The rest give workers a lump sum of time off to use for vacation, sick days or personal time. The survey found a large group of traditional companies — about 36 percent — offer unlimited sick time. Another 28 percent let workers collect more than six weeks. Tampa's 30-day cap on vacation time also is common, though less so. About one-fifth of traditional employers set caps between 21 and 30 days. Roughly the same number allow workers to carry only five days to the next year. Almost 11 percent allow unlimited vacation accumulation. Another report has similar results. A 2009 survey by the Society for Human Resources Management found that 14 percent of traditional companies offer unlimited sick time. On average, companies allowed workers to roll over 20 vacation days to the next year, or 10 days less than the city of Tampa. We sent Turanchik copies of the studies and asked him if he had any evidence to support his statement that "no one" in private business gets unlimited vacation and sick leave. He said he made the claim based on his own experience as a labor lawyer and from talking with business owners. "I haven't talked to a single business in the Tampa Bay area that allows for unlimited accruals," he said. Turanchik also pointed to another finding from the Alexander Hamilton Institute: 87 percent of employers, a "resounding majority," don't cash out unused sick time when a worker retires. "It's just not a package you see," he said. "I'm sure there's a few companies that do it. But as a general proposition, it's just not an acceptable practice." Our ruling Turanchik's description of Tampa's benefits package is largely correct. He's also right that it's rare for a private business to offer unlimited accumulation of sick leave with a large payout upon retirement. Unlimited vacation also is rare. But his original statement was "no one" in the private sector gets unlimited vacation and sick leave. Several studies say that's not true -- though very few of those companies will pay for unused sick time upon retirement as the city does. The essence of his point is correct, and we rate Turanchik's statement Half True.	None	Ed Turanchik	None	None	None	2011-01-28T17:55:54	2010-12-09	['None']
pomt-01629	Heroin and prescription opioids are "the number one cause of accidental or preventable death in Wisconsin."	false	/wisconsin/statements/2014/aug/27/brad-schimel/top-cause-preventable-deaths-heroin-prescription-o/	Federal health officials have documented a rise in overdose deaths from opioids -- heroin, as well as prescription painkillers such as OxyContin that can lead to heroin abuse. The latest figures, reported in July 2014, show there were 4,397 heroin deaths across the country in 2011, up 44 percent from 2010. Meanwhile, prescription opioid deaths, following a more than decade-long rise, claimed many more lives -- 16,917, up 2 percent. But, comparatively speaking, just how serious is the opioid problem? In an Aug. 15, 2014 interview on Wisconsin Public Television, Waukesha County District Attorney Brad Schimel, the Republican candidate for state attorney general, was asked what he considered the most important facing the winner of the Nov. 4, 2014 election. Schimel -- who faces Jefferson County District Attorney Susan Happ, a Democrat -- gave this response: "Well, right now, the biggest public safety issue we face is the heroin and prescription opioid problem. It is the number one cause of accidental or preventable death in Wisconsin. It surpassed traffic crashes quite a few years ago already." Is it true that overdoses from heroin or prescription opioids not only outnumber traffic fatalities, but are the top cause of accidental deaths in Wisconsin? The statistics The latest figures from the U.S.Centers for Disease Control and Prevention show that nationally, there were 41,340 fatal drug overdoses of all types in 2011, making it the leading cause of injury death in the country. But what about in Wisconsin? When we asked Schimel’s campaign about his claim, Schimel replied in an email that he had misspoken. He told us he meant to say that the number of all drug overdose deaths in Wisconsin -- not just heroin and prescription opioid deaths -- exceed the number of motor vehicle deaths and are the top cause of accidental deaths. We checked the latest report from the state Department of Health Services, which said there were 2,789 accidental deaths in 2012. The leading cause was 1,091 falls (which also was the leading cause in 2011, according to the department). There were 615 motor vehicle deaths. The same number of deaths -- 615-- was caused by "accidental poisoning and exposure to noxious substances." But those 615 included deaths caused by a variety of drugs, as well as other substances such as alcohol. Separately, we obtained figures from the health department showing there were 511 opioid deaths in Wisconsin in 2012. That included 187 heroin deaths, up from 27 in 2002. And there were 324 deaths caused either by prescription opioids or a mix of prescription opioids and heroin, up from 144 in 2002. Our rating Schimel said heroin and prescription opioidss are "the number one cause of accidental or preventable death in Wisconsin." Schimel acknowledged to us that he misspoke and in fact opioid deaths are down the list. The latest figures, for 2012, show falls was the leading causes of accidental death in Wisconsin. Tied for second were motor vehicle deaths and drug overdose of all types -- including 511 deaths from heroin or prescription opioids. We rate the statement False.

pomt-04712	Says Gov. Chris Christie has embarked on a tour to "demand that New Jersey’s Democratic legislature approve an immediate tax cut that would disproportionately benefit the wealthiest."	false	/new-jersey/statements/2012/sep/02/barbara-buono/barbara-buono-says-chris-christie-embarked-tour-de/	Even before Gov. Chris Christie stepped on stage Tuesday night to deliver his keynote address at the Republican National Convention, New Jersey Democrats were criticizing the governor for exaggerating his success as the state’s chief executive. Barbara Buono, a Senate Democrat from Middlesex County who has said she is "seriously considering" a 2013 bid for governor, took aim at Christie in an opinion column published in Politico late Monday night for making "wildly optimistic" revenue projections to prove New Jersey can afford a tax cut. "Being honest about the numbers would undermine the ‘Endless Summer’ tour that Christie has embarked on to demand that New Jersey’s Democratic legislature approve an immediate tax cut that would disproportionately benefit the wealthiest – regardless of whether the state can afford it," Buono wrote. Here, however, it’s Buono that’s not being forthright. Although Christie initially proposed in January to cut income taxes 10 percent across-the-board over three years, he backed off that proposal before the start of his "Endless Summer" tour. Christie now supports a plan based on a proposal from the Senate Democrats that would provide homeowners with an income tax credit based on their property tax bills. Under the governor’s original plan higher income filers, who pay more in income taxes, would have benefited more than lower income filers. But under the plan Christie now supports -- the plan he signed onto before kicking off his tour of New Jersey to blast Democrats for not approving a tax cut -- that’s not the case since some wealthy individuals would not even qualify for a tax cut. On July 2, Christie conditionally vetoed a bill increasing the state’s top income tax rate on millionaires to enhance property tax relief payments for certain residents. Christie suggested turning that legislation into a tax cut plan based on a proposal the Senate Democrats released earlier in the year. Under Christie's new proposal, homeowners who earn $400,000 or less in taxable income would receive an income tax credit based on their property tax bill. The credit would be phased in over four years, reaching 10 percent of the first $10,000 homeowners pay in property taxes. The maximum credit under the plan would be $1,000. To support the state senator’s claim, Christina Zuk, Buono’s chief of staff, pointed to a July 26 news article that quotes Christie saying: "I'm fighting for the tax cut now because you know, businesspeople are making decisions now about whether they're going to expand next year. The Democrats say we'll get to it. We'll get to the tax cut in December or January. Well that's going to be too late for 2013. Those businesspeople are already going to be deciding where they're going to invest their money, where they're going to spend." But Christie just says tax cut, not income tax cut. And still, he has publicly backed off his original proposal and put forth a plan based on a homeowner’s property tax burden. It’s also worth noting that Christie’s conditional veto also recommended restoring a cut he made during his first year in office to the state’s Earned Income Tax Credit, a program which benefits lower income individuals. The conditional veto increased the state credit to 25 percent of the federal credit amount, up from 20 percent. Our ruling Buono said that Christie embarked on an "Endless Summer" tour to "demand that New Jersey’s Democratic legislature approve an immediate tax cut that would disproportionately benefit the wealthiest." Christie first proposed an across-the-board income tax cut that would have benefited higher income filers more than lower income filers. But Christie has since backed off that plan. Before the governor kicked off his "Endless Summer" tour, he signed on to a version of the Senate Democrats’ plan to give an income tax credit based on individuals’ property tax bills. We rate Buono’s statement False. To comment on this ruling, go to NJ.com.

pomt-05108	"Obamacare is . . . the largest tax increase in the history of the world."	pants on fire!	/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/jun/28/rush-limbaugh/health-care-law-not-largest-tax-increase-us-histor/	A silver lining for conservatives in the Supreme Court’s health care decision Thursday is that the court allowed the law to stand based on the idea that the individual mandate was a tax. That news has Republicans and conservative radio talk show host Rush Limbaugh bringing out an old -- and incorrect claim -- that the health care law constitutes the largest tax increase ever. Rep. Connie Mack, a Republican from Florida running for the U.S. Senate, called it "the largest tax on the American people in history" in a press release. Florida GOP congressional candidate state Rep. Gary Aubuchon said on Twitter that the "ruling confirms Obamacare is the largest tax increase in U.S. history. U.S. Rep. Jeff Landry, R-Pa., put it this way: "This is the largest tax increase on the poor and the middle class in the history of this country"; and Alabama Republican Party chair Bill Armistead said that "The United States Supreme Court has essentially created the largest tax increase in American history." Then there's Limbaugh, who turned up the rhetoric on radio the way only he can. Forget the United States,"Obamacare is nothing more than the largest tax increase in the history of the world," he declared. This claim is wrong. While the health care law certainly is, on the whole, a tax increase, it’s not the largest in American history -- and as such -- cannot be the largest in the history of the world. (Luckily, there's enough U.S.-based research that we don't have to explore the tax increases of the Roman Empire, adjusted for inflation.) We addressed this more than a year ago. But here’s a refresher. Major tax provisions The federal Joint Committee on Taxation, a nonpartisan committee of Congress with a professional staff of economists, attorneys and accountants, provided members a detailed breakdown of the tax impact of the health care law from 2010-2019. • Starting in 2013, Medicare payroll taxes increase 0.9 percentage points for people with incomes over $200,000 ($250,000 for couples filing jointly). Also, people at this income level would pay a new 3.8 percent tax on investment income. The 10-year cost: $210.2 billion. • Starting in 2018, a new 40 percent excise tax on high-cost health plans, so-called "Cadillac plans" (over $10,200 for individuals, $27,500 for families), kicks in. That's expected to bring the government a total of $32 billion in 2018 and 2019. • Starting in 2011, there's a new fee for pharmaceutical manufacturers and importers. That's expected to raise $27 billion over 10 years. • Starting in 2013, a 2.3 percent excise tax on manufacturers and importers of certain medical devices starts. The 10-year total: $20 billion. • Starting in 2014, a new annual fee on health insurance providers begins. Total estimated 10-year revenue: $60.1 billion. • Starting in 2013, the floor on medical expense deductions on itemized income tax returns will be raised from 7.5 percent to 10 percent of income. That's expected to bring in $15.2 billion over the next 10 years. • Starting in 2011, a 10 percent excise tax on indoor tanning services. That's expected to bring in $2.7 billion over the next 10 years. There also is money in the law going the other way. The plan includes government money, in the form of tax credits, to subsidize the cost of health insurance for lower-income people who don't get insurance through their employer. For the record, many Republicans and tax experts argue those shouldn't count as tax cuts. And there is a tax cut for some very small businesses that allows them to write off a portion of the cost of providing insurance to their employees. Combined with various other revenue-generating provisions, the Joint Committee on Taxation estimates the health law will bring in more than $437.8 billion by 2019. The government's nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimated the additional revenues coming in to the government to be $525 billion between now and 2019. Does that translate to the biggest tax increase in American history? Comparing tax impacts of legislation First, we need to set some goal posts. There are many ways to define or measure the size of a tax increase, and not all tax increases have been measured the same way over time. The health care tax provisions, for instance, take effect between 2011 and 2018, meaning the full effect of the legislation won't be felt until near the end of the decade. On top of that, it doesn't make sense to compare 2019 dollars to 1985 dollars. You have to adjust for inflation, or express the amount as a total of Gross Domestic Product at the time, which is a way to measure the relative impact of a tax provision at the time it was enacted. To make matters even more complicated, there are tax cuts that are direct results of tax increases, and vice-versa. The Tax Equity and Fiscal Responsibility Act of 1982 (TEFRA), for example, was passed largely to reverse revenue losses from the Economic Recovery Tax Act of 1981 (ERTA). For our comparison, we used a method perfected by Jerry Tempalski, an analyst in the Office of Tax Analysis with the U.S. Department of the Treasury. In 2006, Tempalski tried to determine the relative impact of major tax revenue bills from 1940-2006. He used revenue estimates from Treasury and the Joint Committee on Taxation and calculated the impact as a percentage of GDP. For 1940-1967 calculations, he used a single-year snapshot of the revenue impact of the tax legislation. For more recent tax bills, from 1968-2006, Tempalski used a two-year average of the revenue effects. Tempalski wrote: "The comparison of tax bills for the first period should be examined with some caution, because the revenue estimates are from different sources and are not completely consistent. The comparison for the second period can be viewed with more confidence, because the estimates are relatively consistent." As a percent of GDP, here are the top five tax increases from 1940-2006, according to Tempalski: 1. Revenue Act of 1942: 5.04 percent of GDP; 2. Revenue Act of 1941: 2.2 percent of GDP; 3. Current Tax Payment Act of 1943: 1.13 percent of GDP; 4. Revenue and Expenditure Control Act of 1968: 1.09 percent of GDP; 5. Excess Profits Tax of 1950: .97 percent of GDP; And here are the top five tax increases from the "modern" era of 1968-2006: 1. Revenue and Expenditure Control Act of 1968: 1.09 percent of GDP; 2. Tax Equity and Fiscal Responsibility Act of 1982: .8 percent of GDP; 3(t): Crude Oil Windfall Profit Tax Act of 1980: .5 percent of GDP 3(t): Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993; .5 percent of GDP; 5: Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990; .49 percent of GDP. The 2010 health care law The list obviously does not include the health care law, which passed in 2010, and a spokeswoman for the Department of Treasury says it hasn't been updated. So we calculated our own percent of GDP figure. We used 2019 as our baseline because that's when all of the tax provisions of the law will be in effect. In 2019, the CBO estimates, the government will see increased revenues of $104 billion. We then divided that number into the projected GDP for 2019, which according to the CBO economic forecast is $21.164 trillion. That would mean the tax increase provisions of the health care law would amount to .49 percent of total GDP. Depending on your rounding, that would mean the tax increases resulting from the health care law would be about the size of tax increases proposed and passed in 1980 by President Jimmy Carter, in 1990 by President George H.W. Bush and in 1993 by President Bill Clinton. The health care-related tax increases are smaller than the tax increase signed into law by President Ronald Reagan in 1982 and a temporary tax signed into law in 1968 by President Lyndon B. Johnson. And they are significantly smaller than two tax increases passed during World War II and a tax increase passed in 1961. The tax increases in the health care legislation do reverse a trend of federal tax cuts and represent the first significant tax increases since 1993. But they are not the largest in the history of the United States. And -- despite what Limbaugh said -- that means they cannot be the largest ever in the history of world. Limbaugh's inflated rhetoric takes a wrong claim and puts it into the realm of the ridiculous. We rate it Pants on Fire. UPDATE: Some readers noticed that our initial analysis of Limbaugh’s claim failed to include references to the penalty that people who declined to purchase health insurance would be asked to pay. After all, the Supreme Court declared that penalty a tax. The CBO figure we used for our calculation, a total of $104 billion in revenue generated in 2019, is inclusive of all revenues, including the penalty or tax individuals might pay if they do not purchase health insurance. The figure for that year was estimated to be $14 billion for penalties paid for by employees and individuals. (Page 19 of this report.)

pomt-10303	Fully inflating tires is "a step that every expert says would absolutely reduce our oil consumption by 3 to 4 percent."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/aug/08/barack-obama/obama-inflates-this-tire-claim/	Who would've guessed tire pressure would turn out to be Topic A on the campaign trail? The candidates have been talking about it for days. At a town hall event in Berea, Ohio, Sen. Barack Obama brought up the subject again, knocking Sen. John McCain for mocking him for advocating proper tire inflation. "The Republicans are going around -- this is the kind of thing they do, I don't understand it -- they're going around, they're sending, like, little tire gauges, making fun of this idea, as if this is Barack Obama's energy plan," Obama said in the August 5 appearance. "Now, two points: One, they know they're lying about what my energy plan is. But the other thing is they're making fun of a step that every expert says would absolutely reduce our oil consumption by 3 to 4 percent." We've decided to check that last sentence, which the McCain campaign and a conservative blog brought to our attention. We found that Obama was correct in a prior claim along these lines, when he suggested that inflating tires properly and getting tune-ups could "save all the oil" we could get from drilling in protected areas offshore. (The McCain campaign and its allies in the conservative blogosphere have attacked that finding from every angle, but we stand by it.) But this new claim is different. This time Obama didn't talk about what tire inflation and tune-ups "could" do. He said "every expert" was in agreement that tire inflation "would absolutely reduce our oil consumption" by 3 to 4 percent. We imagine very few experts would say that. "You can make some back of the envelope calculations to show that number would be impossible to obtain," said Thomas Menzies, a senior program officer at the Transportation Research Board of the National Academies who managed and drafted a study on tires and fuel economy. So let's do that. To support the claim, Obama's campaign referred us to this brochure from the U.S. Department of Energy. On page 31 it says: "Keep tires properly inflated and aligned to improve your gasoline mileage by around 3.3 percent." Similarly, this Department of Energy Web page says: "You can improve your gas mileage by around 3.3 percent by keeping your tires inflated to the proper pressure. Under-inflated tires can lower gas mileage by 0.4 percent for every 1 psi drop in pressure of all four tires." Under-inflation is a severe problem (affecting 80 out of 81 cars according to one survey), but most tires do not suffer from severe under-inflation. This survey by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration found that 26 percent of passenger vehicles had at least one tire under-inflated by 25 percent or more, and the average under-inflation of the four tires for those vehicles (not each tire) was 6.8 pounds per square inch. So if those drivers corrected their tire pressure, their fuel consumption would be 2.7 percent (6.8 x .4) better. That's just the severe under-inflators -- savings would be smaller for the rest of us. So fuel consumption would fall by something less than 2.7 percent if passenger vehicles corrected their tire pressure. Furthermore, those savings alone would not result in a one-to-one reduction in oil consumption, as Obama suggested, since just 70 percent of the oil we consume goes to vehicles. The rest gets used in a vast array of products from petroleum jelly to fertilizer. Also, commercial vehicles have less of a problem with under-inflation, because truckers check their tire pressure religiously to minimize fuel consumption. So they would further drag down the average savings from correcting tire pressure. Obama's prior claim on this subject was safely couched in generalities and possibilities. But this time he veered into certainties and absolutes -- "every expert," "would absolutely" -- put an exact number on fuel savings, and linked it to overall oil consumption in a way that did not stand up to scrutiny. We find his claim to be False.	None	Barack Obama	None	None	None	2008-08-08T00:00:00	2008-08-05	['None']
pomt-13873	Says Donald Trump's position is "to roll back all" of the financial regulations passed after the financial crisis.	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/jul/05/elizabeth-warren/warren-says-trump-no-fan-post-crisis-wall-street-r/	Sen. Elizabeth Warren did not leave her signature issue behind when she became presumptive Republican nominee Donald Trump’s most pugnacious critic. "Donald Trump has already offered his big wet kiss to Wall Street. He has said, ‘Hey guys, if I get in, I'm going to roll back all of those regulations, because it makes it too hard for banks to cheat people,’ " Warren said in a June 28 interview on The View. Trump never said he wanted to make it easier for banks to cheat people, but he has said he wants to roll back regulations on Wall Street. In the context of the interview, Warren is likely referring to the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protect Act, the premier piece of legislation regulating the banking industry after the crash. Warren has been a consistent crusader for stricter regulation of the financial industry. Early in the campaign, Trump distinguished himself from his rivals for the Republican nomination with some tough language directed toward Wall Street. "The hedge fund guys didn't build this country. These are guys that shift paper around and they get lucky," Trump said in a CBS interview in August. At other points, he extended a similar critique to "Wall Street Guys" in general. Trump said that hedge fund managers "get away with murder," but he’s been unclear about what he’d do to change that. One concrete Trump proposal on Wall Street was changes to the tax code that would change tax provisions benefitting hedge fund managers, but because of separate tax cuts for partnerships, his tax plan actually had the effect of substantially improving their position. On Dodd-Frank, Trump has gone on the record again and again saying that the law is bad news for the economy and the banking industry. He’s called it a "disaster," and a "very negative force." Well before he launched his current presidential run, Trump attacked increased regulation after the financial crisis, which he said prevented loans to all but the very wealthy. And while it's not the same thing as a "big wet kiss to Wall Street," Trump has said he expects bankers to appreciate his position. "I think things have to be done with (Dodd-Frank), and I think Wall Street would like to hear that," Trump told Fox Business host Maria Bartiromo. The only bit of wiggle room here is that Trump has been inconsistent about how much of Dodd-Frank would be left when he finished with it. He has said he would "get rid of it," "repeal it" or, almost word-for-word from Warren’s statement, "roll that back." He has also said, however, that "there are some aspects you could leave," and that could be "changed greatly" instead of being eliminated. In Trump’s most recent statement about Dodd-Frank, in a mid May interview with Reuters, he said he would release a plan within two weeks that would be "close to a dismantling of Dodd-Frank." A month after his Reuters interview, the plan, which would presumably settle this question, has not been released. The Trump campaign did not respond to a request for comment for this story. Our ruling Warren said Trump wants to "roll back all of those regulations" on Wall Street banks. While we don’t know what Trump’s plan would look like exactly, he certainly wants to scrap a lot of the law. It might not be right to say "all" of those regulations, but Trump himself has been unclear on that point. We rate this Mostly True.

pomt-11583	"New York consistently ranks as one of the worst voting turnout states in the nation."	true	/new-york/statements/2018/feb/01/andrea-stewart-cousins/new-york-consistently-ranks-low-voter-turnout/	Andrea Stewart-Cousins, the top-ranking Democrat in the New York State Senate, claimed New York state has one of the lowest voter turnout rates in the country. New York state, which has the fourth most registered voters among states, historically does not have high voter turnouts, the Westchester Democrat said. "New York consistently ranks as one of the worst voting turnout states in the nation," Stewart-Cousins said. Democrats in the Senate want Republicans, who control the chamber, to support legislation they believe would increase turnout. More than a dozen bills introduced by Stewart-Cousins and other Democrats would allow automatic voter registration and early voting among other changes. Is voter turnout really as bad in New York state as Stewart-Cousins said? Presidential election years In the November 2016 election, New York state had the eighth-worst voter turnout among states, when 57.2 percent of voting-age citizens went to the polls, according to U.S. Census Bureau figures. Before 2016, New York state has ranked in the bottom half of states for voter turnout in all but one election during the last two decades, according to the census figures. The state ranked 29th in voter turnout among states in the 1996 presidential election. Some years have been better than others, but the state’s turnout has mostly declined since then. 2000: New York state ranked 35th in voter turnout at 59 percent. 2004: The state ranked 42nd, but the turnout rate increased that year to 60.2 percent. 2008: Turnout dropped to 58.8 percent. The state ranked 43rd that year. 2012: The state ranked 39th with a turnout rate of 58.7 percent. The state has also ranked poorly in most non-presidential election years, when turnout is generally lower in all states. 1998: New York state ranked 23rd among states, its best ranking in the past two decades with a turnout rate of 48.2 percent. 2002: The ranking went down to 39th with a turnout rate of 43.6 percent. 2006: The state ranked 45th at 42.5 percent. 2010: New York state ranked 37th at 43.6 percent. 2014: Turnout dipped to 34.4 percent. New York state ranked 48th. Except for 2014, the state’s voter turnout rate has not varied much between four-year periods. Rates for other low-turnout states have shifted New York state’s ranking each year. Turnout in Georgia, for example, has increased from about 51 percent in 1996 to 60 percent in 2016. Other data Election data experts also rank New York state near the bottom of states for voter turnout. The United States Election Project, with election numbers dating back to 1980, ranked New York state 14th lowest in voter turnout in 2016. The project uses different methodology than the Census Bureau to calculate turnout, according to Dr. Michael McDonald, the University of Florida professor who created and manages its database. The Census Bureau tracks turnout rates based on self-reporting from people in each state. McDonald, instead, uses the total population of eligible voters in each state drawn from administrative records. He then compares that population with the number of votes for the highest office on the ballot each year. New York state ranked in the bottom 10 states for voter turnout in all but two elections over the last decade, according to McDonald’s numbers. Our ruling Stewart-Cousins said "New York consistently ranks as one of the worst voting turnout states in the nation." Voter turnout rates reported by the U.S. Census Bureau and McDonald confirm that claim. New York state has ranked near the bottom of states for voter turnout in most elections over the last few decades. We rate her claim True.

pomt-04233	Says Fran DeWine’s made-from-scratch dinner rolls are a delicious favorite in a traditional Thanksgiving dinner.	true	/ohio/statements/2012/nov/21/mike-dewine/mike-dewine-touts-his-wifes-recipes-delicious-part/	Even PolitiFact Ohio needs an occasional break from politics. We decided that taking one on Thanksgiving would give all of us something to be thankful for. But fact-checking doesn't take a holiday. When we received a Thanksgiving news release from Ohio Attorney General Mike DeWine, our attention was immediately seized. In addition to holiday greetings, the release included three recipes DeWine credited to his wife, Fran. He said the recipes -- for crescent rolls, broccoli salad and "Fran's carrot cake with lemon cream cheese icing" -- are family favorites and part of a delicious and traditional Thanksgiving meal. Hoping it didn't look too obviously like we were pitching for samples, PolitiFact Ohio asked the attorney general how he backs up his claim of deliciousness. "I think I would start with the rolls," he told us. "Fran's been making these rolls for, well, we've been married for 45 years, and she's been making the rolls for probably 40. She took it from a recipe in one of her first cookbooks, and she modified it mainly by adding honey." She also adds cracked wheat flour from the family farm because "it embodies the spirit of the harvest," he said. "The strongest evidence (of deliciousness) I would give," he continued, "is if you would be there on Thanksgiving, or any other meal, to watch our grandkids wait for the turkey to come out of the oven. "Fran takes the turkey out and puts the rolls in. Before they can actually get served, kids are taking rolls off the pan, burning their fingers to get them. I've seen them put as many as five on a plate." The DeWines have 18 grandchildren, with a 19th on the way next month. They host 75 people for Thanksgiving. To feed them all, Mrs. DeWine makes 12 dozen rolls. "They're to die for," her husband said. "The best evidence is to watch people eat them. Even people who say they don't eat rolls like them. At any family gathering, really, people expect Fran to have them." DeWine sometimes spreads them with red raspberry jam from his son, an organic farmer. To be really decadent, he said, he adds both jam and butter. We questioned whether that wouldn't be so good it's illegal. Exercising his prosecutorial discretion as the state's chief law enforcement officer, he assured us we would be on safe legal ground. He said the broccoli salad was a relatively new addition to the holiday menu that was added by a daughter-in-law. "I'm not a great fan of broccoli per se, but in that combination it's very, very tasty," he said. "It's a healthy, interesting mixture." We asked him about the cake. At PolitiFact Ohio, we are well known as carrot cake fiends. "The carrot cake is also a favorite of mine," he said. "The frosting is very similar to a frosting my mother used to make on chocolate cake, a cream cheese with lemon frosting. When it comes out of the oven …" PolitiFact Ohio didn’t press him to finish the description. We had heard enough to begin pondering how we could slip in for dinner. A family recipe in use four decades certainly is a tradition. And DeWine’s descriptions left us craving his wife’s cooking. We rate his claim of deliciousness as True. We’re sharing the recipe for Fran DeWine’s Favorite Rolls above. They would certainly enhance any holiday leftovers. You can find the others in his news release. Happy Thanksgiving.

pomt-12954	"Jackie Evancho’s album sales have skyrocketed after announcing her inauguration performance."	true	/pennsylvania/statements/2017/jan/05/donald-trump/did-word-trumps-inauguration-concert-cause-jackie-/	Donald Trump hasn’t had an easy time getting artists to perform at his inauguration. Many, reportedly including Elton John and Bruno Mars, said they wouldn’t perform. So far the only artists slated for the inauguration on Jan. 20 are the Mormon Tabernacle Choir, the Rockettes and Pittsburgh-area native Jackie Evancho, who rose to fame on "America’s Got Talent." And Trump believes Evancho’s decision to perform has been great for her career. On Twitter Wednesday, he claimed Evancho’s "album sales have skyrocketed after announcing her inauguration performance." Not long after, the New York Times’ Dave Itzkoff tweeted a screenshot displaying Evancho’s most recent album falling from 93 to 134 on the Billboard top 200 albums list in the last week. That didn’t look so good for the president-elect. So is Trump’s Twitter boast correct? Did Evancho, who is 16, see a steep rise in sales since it was announced she’d be a performer at the Trump inauguration? It was Dec. 14 when Evancho said she’d be performing. She had released a new album in late October, "Someday at Christmas." Numbers from BuzzAngle Music, a music data-tracking company, show digital and physical sales of all her albums hovering between 2,500 and about 3,000 in late October to the end of November (Evancho has three older full-length albums, including another Christmas album). Sales rose to about 4,600 the first week after Thanksgiving. For the week beginning Dec. 2, they were 5,800. (BuzzAngle tracks sales from a Friday to Thursday every week.) The inaugural announcement happened in the middle of the next week. For the Dec. 9 to Dec. 15 sales period, her sales jumped to about 7,176. The next week, from Dec. 16 to Dec. 22, they went up to 14,173. That’s an increase of 98 percent. The sales bump ended there. The week of Dec. 23 to Dec. 29, Evancho’s sales fell down to 9,479. As of Wednesday, her sales for this week were at 1,442. During the same timeframe, Evancho’s streaming rates went up at a similar rate. The first full week after the Trump announcement, beginning Dec. 16, Evancho’s songs were streamed about 754,000 times. The previous week they had been streamed about 410,000 times. Our Ruling Donald Trump tweeted that 16-year-old Jackie Evancho’s "album sales have skyrocketed after announcing her inauguration performance." He’s right. Evancho’s album sales nearly doubled in the first full week after she was announced as an inauguration performer compared to the previous week. (She was also streamed much more often.) Though sales for the week of Dec. 23 to Dec. 29 went down from about 14,000 to 9,000, that number is still about 50 percent higher than from the week of Dec. 2 to Dec. 9. That is the last full week BuzzAngle Music has data for. Besides, rockets typically come down. We rule the claim True.	None	Donald Trump	None	None	None	2017-01-05T12:40:34	2017-01-04	['None']

Three months of the war would cost $30 billion. The expansion if SCHIP is estimated to cost $35 billion over five years, according to the Congressional Budget Office.

pomt-00510	As governor, Maggie Hassan first proposed a $1 billion spending increase.	half-true	/new-hampshire/statements/2015/jun/24/impact-america/ad-says-nh-governor-hassan-proposed-1-billion-spen/	As budget season threatens to go into overtime and Democratic Gov. Maggie Hassan ponders her political future, ads are already attacking her management of the state budget. One spot in particular, funded by the "pro-growth" group Impact America Action, is called "Hassan Spending Problem" and cites a particularly noteworthy number. "Maggie Hassan has a spending problem," the spot’s narrator says, in a web ad viewed more than 27,000 times. "As governor, Hassan first proposed a $1 billion spending increase." The number also appears in an ad titled "The Hassan Plan," as well as on the group’s website. But is the claim true? Did Hassan actually propose such an increase with her first budget, for 2014-2015? We decided to check it out. Hassan came into office inheriting a $10.1 billion total budget approved by a Republican-controlled legislature. Her first budget proposal weighed in at $11.1 billion -- a roughly 10 percent increase -- and it restored many cuts, including a halving of aid to the university system. Here’s how that $1 billion increase broke down, according to Hassan’s executive summary. -- $184 million more from the general fund -- $493 million more from the federal government -- $348 million more from "other funds," which includes the education trust fund; fees and assessments to fund the banking and insurance departments and the Public Utilities Commission; county and local funding; and transfers among state agencies: It’s worth noting that nearly half of that $1 billion increase comes from federal funds -- not New Hampshire state taxes. And that $493 million was meant mostly for the expansion of Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act. When politicians debate the budget, though, they generally talk about general fund spending, because that’s the pot of money most directly controlled by the state. Looking at that fund alone, Hassan’s budget proposed an increase of about $184 million. That’s up "7.1 percent, from more than $2.6 billion to nearly $2.8 billion," according to Concord Monitor reporting. The ad cherry-picked the most all-encompassing number -- total spending, including federal grants. (It also was careful enough not to claim claim that Hassan proposed hiking taxes by $1 billion or raising spending $1 billion more from the general fund. Both claims would have been entirely untrue.) Impact America Action is a 501(c)(4) nonprofit group that isn’t required to report its donors publicly, according to the Sunlight Foundation. But the ad does cite a source for its $1 billion claim. That would be an article from the New Hampshire Union-Leader, dated Feb. 14, 2013. But even that article clarified that Hassan’s total budget request included "federal money and other state revenue such as highway funds and court fines." It’s also worth noting, the two-year budget cycle closes on June 30, and the state is expected to ultimately spend about $10.5 billion during the period the ad cites. New Hampshire Democrats panned the ads, saying the claims had already been debunked by PolitiFact. It’s true when Hassan was running for election in 2012 we checked claims about Hassan’s votes to increase taxes and budget increases when she was Senate Majority Leader. But this recent claim was a new one to us. Our ruling Multiple ads from Impact America Action state that "As governor, Hassan first proposed a $1 billion spending increase." The reality is more complicated. There was a spending increase of $1 billion in her proposal, but nearly half of that amount came from the federal government, and much of the rest came from other sources of revenue. Only about $184 million -- one fifth of the total increased spending -- came from the general fund.

pomt-07811	For thousands of public employees, Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker’s budget-repair bill would "take away any say they have in the workplace, and eliminate their union."	half-true	/wisconsin/statements/2011/feb/17/afl-cio/wisconsin-afl-cio-says-gov-scott-walkers-budget-re/	Labor experts agree that Gov. Scott Walker’s move to curtail collective bargaining rights for public employees is a dramatic departure from Wisconsin’s labor-friendly past. The Wisconsin State AFL-CIO has launched TV and radio spots condemning the plan while the Wisconsin Club for Growth is airing a TV ad supporting the changes. We’ll look at the Club for Growth ad in a separate item. The TV ad from the AFL-CIO centers on this message, delivered by a narrator: "There’s now a move under way in Madison to take away the rights of thousands of teachers, nurses and other trusted public employees. A bill to take away any say they have in the workplace, and eliminate their union." The visual backdrop includes lines from news articles about Walker’s plan. Among the snippets: A Milwaukee Journal Sentinel story that reads Walker’s plan would eliminate "any say on benefits and work rules" and an Associated Press story that reads "all collective bargaining rights would be removed for state and local public employees." Is the ad correct that the plan would "eliminate" union representation for thousands and wipe out "any say" they have through collective bargaining. When asked to back up the claims, AFL-CIO Secretary-Treasurer Stephanie Bloomingdale cited a Wheeler Report analysis that summarizes the budget-repair bill. Let’s take a deeper look at claim. Most of the debate has focused on what bargaining rights will be curtailed and the overall effect of the plan. Digging deeper, the bill does eliminate all bargaining rights -- wages, benefits, working conditions -- for specific categories of public employees. It would roll back the rights to organize unions and bargain for benefits for 30,000 University of Wisconsin System faculty and academic staff. Those rights were approved by Democrats in the 2009-'11 budget. Not all of the 30,000 have joined a union, though. So far, under those rights, faculty at two universities, UW-Superior and UW-Eau Claire, have formed unions. The measure would also repeal collective bargaining rights for some 5,000 home health care workers and for 2,800 employees of University of Wisconsin Hospitals and Clinics, including nurses. It would also eliminate current collective bargaining rights of licensed child care providers. All of that is also discussed in summaries of the bill and a letter from Walker to state employees. As for the other public employees -- a much larger group that includes schoolteachers, local government workers and about half of 76,000 state employees -- the bill would allow collective bargaining only on a base pay rate (not overtime or special pay issues), and on raises only within the rate of inflation. That means no bargaining on fringe benefits, working conditions, outsourcing, safety and other issues. So, the TV ad is correct on many of its main points. But it also overreaches. For instance, it suggests that the outright elimination of bargaining rights would cover all public employees. But they would not be completely eliminated for teachers outside of higher education, one group cited. Or for all "other trusted public employees." Indeed, the ad does not mention that there would be no change for firefighters, police and state trooper unions -- a fact that has drawn its own criticism. (Firefighters are part of AFL-CIO; police are not.) That incomplete information is underlined when the ad flashes a portion of a Feb. 10, 2011, Associated Press story, highlighting the words: "All collective bargaining rights would be removed for state and local public employees." That’s a selectively edited version of the AP story, which added a significant phrase to that line: "except when it comes to wages." The effect is to make Walker’s sweeping plan look even bolder. Let’s look at the rest of the message as presented in the ad. Would workers "take away any say" in the workplace, as the ad claims? Walker spokesman Cullen Werwie said public employees would continue to have a say on working conditions -- not through unions, but through civil service laws. He noted those laws contain ways to file workplace grievances, and ensure employees are hired based on merit and experience, and are fired only for just cause. But civil service systems are not in place at all Wisconsin municipalities and leave a lot of workers uncovered, according to Andrew Phillips, general counsel for the Wisconsin Counties Association. For instance, about one-third of counties have no civil service system, and of the two-thirds that do, many only apply to deputy sheriffs, he said. The Legislature was considering changes to address this. What about the question of whether the unions would be eliminated? Clearly, some workers would have the right to organize directly eliminated, while many others would not. Bloomingdale, the AFL-CIO official, acknowledges that the bill before the Legislature does not directly eliminate all subjects of collective bargaining -- but nearly all of them. She argues the bill’s provisions overall discredit the unions’ role and therefore endanger them. One example she cites: Raises for unionized workers would be capped at inflation, but pay for nonunion employees is not. That disparity would hurt union membership, Bloomingdale said. Other aspects of the bill: As Walker noted in his letter, employers would be prohibited from collecting union dues on behalf of the unions, members of collective bargaining units will not be required to pay dues, and there would have to be a vote every year on the status of the union. We asked experts including academics and lawyers on both sides of labor-management talks about the assertion that -- on a practical basis -- the plan would mean the death of public employee unions. James Scott, a management-side attorney who represents Milwaukee County, said the changes are dramatic, but not unprecedented. He said nine states totally prohibit collective bargaining for public employees, and 10 others restrict it to police/fire, or teachers or state employees. His view of how life would be under the proposal: "There isn’t much utility in belonging to a public sector labor union other than perhaps the social side of it," Scott said. He said calling it a death knell for unions might be "a little bit" too strong, but not much. Timothy Hawks, whose law firm represents municipal and state employees, said if the bill goes through as drafted "you have busted every (public employee) union in the state." A state official with a stake in both sides of labor disputes, Peter Davis, general counsel at the Wisconsin Employment Relations Commission, said it was a "fair prediction" public sector workers would walk away from paying dues. Cheryl Maranto, chairman of the management department at Marquette University’s College of Business Administration, said the bill would have the effect of "totally eliminating public sector bargaining in the state" by rendering the unions "irrelevant and powerless." In the historical view, she said Walker’s Democratic predecessor, Jim Doyle, overreached with pro-union moves and now Walker is going too far in the opposite direction. Let’s get to the bottom line. The AFL-CIO ad claims "thousands" of workers, including teachers, would lose all say in the workplace and see their union eliminated under Walker’s budget-repair bill. The measure would eliminate bargaining rights for some groups of public employees, including nurses and teachers in higher education. That total tallies out to "thousands," but the ad presents the question as if all public employees would lose all bargaining rights. It even selectively shortens a news account to underline this point. That is an overreach, at least as an immediate consequence of the bill. As for the future, three of our four experts agreed with the union contention that it could be the end result in the future. The fourth felt it was only a small stretch. The PolitiFact definition for Half True is: The statement is accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of context. That’s what this ad does. And that’s the ruling: Half True.

pomt-06328	"By 2015, we will be sending so much interest" to China that "we will be paying for the entire People's Liberation Army."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/nov/10/michele-bachmann/michele-bachmann-says-us-will-soon-send-enough-int/	During the Nov. 9, 2011, Republican presidential debate in Michigan, Rep. Michele Bachmann took aim at the United States’ dependence on borrowing from China with the use of a striking statistic. "By 2015, we will be sending so much interest money over, we will be paying for the entire People's Liberation Army of China, the No. 1 employer of the world," she said. We wondered whether the part about interest payments and the People’s Liberation Army was accurate. (We have seen conflicting information about whether the PLA is the world’s largest employer, so we’re not going to rate that part of her statement.) First, some background. The PLA is the primary military entity within China and includes the army, navy, and air force, as well as the nation’s nuclear missile assets. It has 2.3 million people on active or reserve status. Officially, the Chinese defense budget is $91.5 billion for 2011. But many experts believe the actual figure is significantly higher. In an annual report to Congress, the Pentagon said that "estimating actual PLA military expenditures is a difficult process due to the lack of accounting transparency and China’s still incomplete transition from a command economy. Moreover, China’s published military budget does not include major categories of expenditure." So the Pentagon estimated that China’s total military-related spending for 2009 was actually "over $150 billion." And what about U.S. interest payments to China? As it happened, PolitiFact Virginia looked at that question earlier this year, so we’ll use their methodology here.. The U.S. has $10.26 trillion in publicly held debt -- that is, the sum of all federal securities held by institutions and individuals outside the U.S. government, including China and other foreign nations. China buys U.S. Treasury bonds in public auctions, the same way other nations and investment companies purchase U.S. debt. According to the Treasury Department, China, along with Chinese companies and investment groups, held about $1.14 trillion in U.S. debt in August 2011, or roughly 11 percent of all public debt, making China the biggest holder of U.S. debt of any foreign country. Because American debt has long been considered one of the safest investments in the world, the government can borrow money at very low cost, paying an average of less than 2 percent annual interest on its debt during the past decade. In October 2011, the U.S. had an average interest rate of 2.859 percent. In fiscal 2011, the federal government is expected to spend $206 billion in interest payments for public debt, according to the Office of Management and Budget. So if China holds about 11 percent of the U.S. public debt, then all other things equal, China would have received $22.7 billion that year. That’s well below even the official, $91.5 billion cost of the PLA, much less the Pentagon’s estimate of $150 billion. There are possible developments that could change this. Interest rates could go up; China could take on a bigger U.S. debt load; the mix of debt vehicles held by China could shift; or PLA spending could plummet. But the gap still seems to us to be too wide to bridge. Bachmann did say "by 2015," not currently, but the trendline doesn’t suggest U.S. interest payments will explode by that much in just four years. Our ruling Bachmann said that "by 2015, we will be sending so much interest" to China that "we will be paying for the entire People's Liberation Army." Today, we only pay about a quarter (if you use official statistics) or 15 percent (if you use the Pentagon’s estimate), and the likelihood that those percentages will increase dramatically within four years is almost nil. So we rate Bachmann’s comment False.	None	Michele Bachmann	None	None	None	2011-11-10T16:57:01	2011-11-09	['China']
pomt-10770	"The founders advised non-interventionism."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2007/oct/22/ron-paul/founders-were-wary-of-european-alliances/	Ron Paul deplored the situation in Iraq during a recent debate, and invoked the founders of the United States as advising non-intervention in foreign affairs. That's arguably true. The sentiment is best encapsulated in George Washington's farewell address of 1796. "The nation which indulges towards another a habitual hatred or a habitual fondness is in some degree a slave," Washington wrote. "It is a slave to its animosity or to its affection, either of which is sufficient to lead it astray from its duty and its interest." Though many of the founding fathers advised avoiding foreign entanglements, in most cases they were thinking of the circumstances of their own day, said Mary Jenkins, a program specialist with the Independence National Historical Park. After the Revolutionary War, many of the founders were worried about the nation's resources, both financial and military, and did not want the young nation to become embroiled in the French Revolution or other European issues. "Certainly for that time period, that was their advice," she said. Historians over the years have debated whether the founders' advice should be extrapolated as appropriate for circumstances more than two hundred years later. That debate continues today. Interestingly, another piece of advice Washington had in his farewell address was to avoid party affiliations, especially parties based on regional distinctions. (Red states, blue states, anyone?)

pomt-13511	Tom Reed "has actually voted for every single trade deal that has ever come before him in any form."	true	/new-york/statements/2016/sep/02/john-plumb/reed-has-voted-trade-deals-opposes-tpp/	U.S. Rep. Tom Reed has come out against the Trans-Pacific Partnership, a trade accord with 11 Pacific Rim nations, but a Democrat trying to unseat him has made a point of reminding voters about his votes on other trade deals. "He has actually voted for every single trade deal that has ever come before him in any form," John Plumb said in an interview on Capital Tonight. Plumb, like others, believes some free trade agreements have hurt the region economically. Reed, R-Corning, first took office in 2011, and he’s taken conservative positions in a Congress where Republicans hold the majority. Plumb, who most recently served as a military aide in the Obama administration, moved back to the Jamestown area in May to run against Reed in the Southern Tier’s sprawling 23rd Congressional District. While Reed has come out against the Trans-Pacific Partnership, that trade deal has yet to come up for a vote in Congress. But others have, so we checked his record to see if he voted for every single trade deal that has come before him so far. Voting on trade deals Since Reed took office, the United States has entered into three trade agreements. The agreements - with Panama, Colombia and South Korea - took effect in 2012. Each reduced trade barriers between the United States and those countries. Reed voted in favor of all three when they came to the floor of the House of Representatives for roll call votes. Reed also voted in 2015 to implement what’s known as Trade Promotion Authority. It has been used for decades to allow the sitting president to negotiate major trade deals with consultation from Congress. In this case, Congress gave President Obama authority to negotiate the Trans-Pacific Partnership. The legislation itself is not a trade deal but is seen as a precursor to one. The Trans-Pacific Partnership would eliminate tariffs on goods and services, remove non-tariff barriers and set rules for trade and business investment among the United States and other countries in the proposed accord, including Australia, Brunei, Canada, Chile, Japan, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, Singapore and Vietnam. New York’s congressional delegation was mixed on the TPA bill because some saw it as a procedural pre-approval for the Trans-Pacific Partnership. Reed voted for the legislation, but he has said he does not support the negotiated Trans-Pacific Partnership. "Tom Reed opposes TPP. He has done so since the text was made available by the Obama administration," said Amy Hasenberg, a spokeswoman for his campaign. "Like every trade deal that has come before Tom, he evaluated it on its merits. For Western New York, TPP didn't have any merits." Voting for free trade Other votes in Congress impact free trade, too. The Cato Institute has compiled votes in Congress on legislation supporting or limiting free trade. One measure, for example, resurrected the Export-Import Bank. Reed voted in favor of resurrecting the Export-Import Bank in 2015 after its authority lapsed for five months.The bank offers credit to a small percentage of foreign buyers who may not be able to afford interest rates available on the free market. The bank subsidizes financing to those buyers by offering lower rates. The institute says the subsidies help some American companies at the expense of domestic customers, foreign suppliers, and other exporters. The bank promotes trade for some products made in the United States over others. The institute says this infringes on free trade. "It’s paying them to do business with American companies," said Bill Watson, a trade policy analyst from the Cato Institute. "The companies get a lower interest rate than they would in the free market. "It does that by putting U.S. taxpayers on the line by guaranteeing financing," he added Simon Johnson of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology agrees, but he said that while export subsidies may reduce free trade, they typically increase trade overall. Our ruling In an interview, Plumb said Reed "has actually voted for every single trade deal that has ever come before him in any form."

pomt-03343	The oceans "have become 30 percent more acidic."	mostly true	/rhode-island/statements/2013/jul/21/sheldon-whitehouse/us-sen-sheldon-whitehouse-says-oceans-are-30-perce/	Most people have heard about what will happen if humans keep pumping large amounts of carbon dioxide into the air as we burn more fossil fuels, including warmer temperatures, melting polar caps, rising sea levels, stronger storms and big changes in the types of plants and animals that can survive and thrive in particular regions of the world. "But wait," as an evil TV pitchman might gleefully declare, "there's more." On June 12, 2013, U.S. Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse, a Democrat from Rhode Island, took to floor of the Senate for one of his regular speeches about the impact of pollution on Earth's climate. This time he focused on a lesser-publicized problem -- the oceans are becoming more acidic. "Our oceans face unprecedented challenges from climate change and carbon pollution," he said. "Oceans have absorbed more than 550 billion tons of our carbon pollution. As a result, they have become 30 percent more acidic. That is a measurement. That is not a theory." Thirty percent more acidic? Our first question was: "Is it true?" Our second was: "If so, what does that mean?" When most people think of measuring acidity, they think of pH, the scale that runs from 0 to 14. (Think back to your school days and the little strips of paper that changed color depending on whether a substance was an acid or a base.) "So," you might ask, "has the pH of the ocean shifted a few points?" Not at all. The pH scale is not a straight-line measure like a yardstick. It's a logarithmic scale, where a one point drop would make a substance 10 times more acidic. (What you're really measuring is the number of hydrogen ions, which determine how acidic something is.) Whitehouse's office directed us to several sources -- and we found our own -- reporting that since the mid-18th century, when air pollution became more prevalent, the pH of surface seawater has gone from about 8.2 to about 8.1. (That's a rise in acidity, but sea water would have to drop below 7.0 before it could be officially classified as an acid.) Lowering the pH by a tenth of a point translates to a 26-percent rise in hydrogen ion concentration, but some of those science sources say the increase is actually closer to 30 percent. The pH scale has been around only since 1909. How do we know what the pH was like in the 1800s or earlier? The oceanographers we consulted told us basic chemistry provides the answer. Seawater absorbs air, including carbon dioxide. The carbon dioxide interacts with the water to make the ocean more acidic. Researchers have good measurements directly comparing carbon dioxide and pH dating to 1989. They show that surface ocean acidity has risen as carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere have risen, just as expected. To go further back in time, scientists have measured the carbon dioxide concentrations in tiny bubbles of air trapped in ice found in places such as Greenland and Antarctica. Those ice cores show that, until the 1850s, the carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere had not risen above 280 parts per million for most of the last million years or so. But in the past century and a half, they’ve been rising steadily, causing an increase in ocean acidity. Today, those carbon dioxide levels have occasionally passed 400 parts per million. "It's been mostly in the last 100 years," said Steve D'Hondt, an oceanography professor at the University of Rhode Island. One other point. The acidity of the entire ocean hasn't changed by the amount Whitehouse citied. The chemical composition of deeper layers shifts much more gradually. "It's been a long time since the deep ocean touched the atmosphere," said Andrew Dickson of the Scripps Institution of Oceanography, at the University of California-San Diego. "So it's not true of the ocean as a whole. It's only true of the surface layer." That leads us to our second question: what does it mean? Because the effects of acidification are currently restricted to the upper 600-1,600 feet of the ocean, where most of the life is found, there's serious concern that small changes in pH will have a big -- and not very healthy -- effect on many ocean species, although some may be unaffected. Earth's oceans have been much more acidic in the past -- 110 million years ago the oceans were 400 percent (five times) more acidic. But most of those changes developed over millions of years, giving organisms time to evolve and adapt to the shift. The current rise in acidity is rapid. Said University of Rhode Island oceanographer Arthur Spivack, "We already have a measurable change in ocean pH and we're going into a period where there will be a substantial change." Our ruling U.S. Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse said the oceans "have become 30 percent more acidic." He is correct if you look at the increase in the concentration of hydrogen ions since the 1850s in the upper layers of the ocean, where most sea life thrives. We also note that he's describing the change using a measure that heightens the drama for the casual listener. But regardless of how it is characterized, that change is cause for concern if it harms ocean creatures sensitive to changes in pH. On the other hand, the deeper ocean has not seen a 30-percent increase. Because his statement is accurate but needs clarification and additional information, we rate it Mostly True.

pomt-06962	"Eighty percent of the American people support an approach (to federal budget problems) that includes revenues and includes cuts."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/jul/15/barack-obama/barack-obama-said-80-percent-americans-favor-both-/	As President Barack Obama and Republicans in Congress continued their high-stakes stand-off over raising the debt ceiling and other budget issues, Obama held a press conference to press his case that he's a reasonable guy. One of the main points of contention is whether an agreement should include tax increases of any kind, such as closing tax loopholes or tax increases on the wealthy. Republicans oppose raising taxes. During a press conference on July 15, 2011, Obama was asked if the negotiations would be going better if he had started making his case to the public months ago, pushing a proposal that included tax increases and spending cuts. Obama rejected the premise. "You have 80 percent of the American people who support a balanced approach. Eighty percent of the American people support an approach that includes revenues and includes cuts. So the notion that somehow the American people aren't sold is not the problem," he said. "The problem is members of Congress are dug in ideologically into various positions because they boxed themselves in with previous statements." We won't weigh in on Obama's diagnosis of being dug in, but we were interested in the poll numbers on whether the public supports a balanced approach or not. The most recent poll we found largely supported Obama's statement. A Gallup poll conducted July 7-10, 2011 posed the question this way: "As you may know, Congress can reduce the federal budget deficit by cutting spending, raising taxes, or a combination of the two. Ideally, how would you prefer to see Congress attempt to reduce the federal budget deficit: only with spending cuts, mostly with spending cuts, equally with spending cuts and tax increases, mostly with tax increases, or only with tax increases?" The answer "only spending cuts" got 20 percent. The other answers were "mostly spending cuts," 30 percent; "equal spending cuts and tax increases," 32 percent; "mostly tax increases," 7 percent; "only tax increases," 4 percent; unsure/other, 6 percent. We'll note that Obama counted in his favor people who favored only tax increases or who weren't sure, so he wasn't completely accurate. If you deduct those groups, only 70 percent support the balanced approach. But the poll did support his overall point. Other polls also showed support for Obama's statement, but not quite at an 80-percent level. A poll from Quinnipiac University conducted July 5-11, 2011, asked: "Do you think any agreement to raise the national debt ceiling should include only spending cuts, or should it also include an increase in taxes for the wealthy and corporations?" In this case, 67 percent favored including tax increases, while 25 percent favored spending cuts only. Another 8 percent were unsure. In June, a Reuters/Ipsos poll found that most people, 46 percent, favored a combination of cuts and tax increases, compared with 26 percent who said cuts alone and 13 percent who said raise taxes. An ABC/Washington Post poll from April found the number was higher, at 59 percent. We reviewed polls and consulted experts a few weeks ago for a fact-check on whether people support tax increases or not. Karlyn Bowman, a senior fellow at the conservative American Enterprise Institute who studies polls on taxation, told us polls usually show support for balanced approaches, particularly if people don't have to pay the higher taxes themselves. "Generally, combinations of tax hikes and spending cuts are most popular. It seems fair to most people. Spending cuts are favored in the abstract. Tax hikes are favored as long as they don't affect me. Generally, people don't think anybody should have to pay more than a quarter of their income in total taxes," she said. Finally, a few other cautions on poll numbers. Pollsters have long noted that when you ask questions with different wording, you get different results. All the polls we looked at phrased the question slightly differently. A few recent polls also suggested that people find the whole debt ceiling debate confusing, or they aren't following it very closely. A Pew Research Center/Washington Post poll from May asked people how well they felt they understood what would happen if the government does not raise the federal debt limit; 47 percent said "not too well" or "not at all well." And the July Gallup poll found that 42 percent of respondents were following the issue "not too closely" or "not at all." Getting back to Obama's statement, he said, "You have 80 percent of the American people who support a balanced approach. Eighty percent of the American people support an approach that includes revenues and includes cuts." Even the best poll doesn't show support quite that high -- he would more accurately have accounted for the small numbers that support only tax increases or were unsure, putting the number at 70 percent. But his overall point is correct that polls show most Americans support a balanced approach when given a choice between cutting spending or raising taxes. So we rate his statement Mostly True.

pomt-03279	Under Obamacare, people who "have a doctor they’ve been seeing for the last 15 or 20 years, they won’t be able to keep going to that doctor."	mostly false	/florida/statements/2013/aug/05/marco-rubio/marco-rubio-says-patients-wont-keep-doctors-obamac/	Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., calls Obamacare a "broken and failed experiment." In an interview with Fox’s Sean Hannity on July 31, Rubio railed against the health care law, saying it would hurt regular folks. "Just think about the people that have health insurance now, and they’re happy with it. They’re going to lose that health insurance. They have a doctor they’ve been seeing for the last 15 or 20 years, they won’t be able to keep going to that doctor," he said. Rubio’s claim that insured patients will have to stop seeing their long-time doctors caught our attention, so we decided to check it out. We asked a Rubio spokesman for an explanation and did not get a response. Even without Obamacare patients sometimes have to switch doctors If we set aside the health care law, there are already ways that people can end up losing access to their doctor now. Companies can switch health care plans, and some employees’ doctors may not be in the new network. Employees can lose their job -- or switch jobs -- and end up with a different plan that doesn’t include the same doctor. Switching jobs -- and therefore, potentially health insurance -- can happen often. In 2012, the median job tenure was 5.4 years, according to the Employee Benefit Research Institute. "It's hard to imagine many people on the same health plan for 15-20 years given natural job turnover," said Paul Fronstin, senior research associate at Employee Benefit Research Institute. The health care law leaves in place the current health insurance system, so switching plans and possibly doctors will still happen. The law also puts more requirements on insurance companies, so that they have to offer more comprehensive coverage. For people who are uninsured or have to buy insurance on their own, the law creates state-by-state health insurance exchanges where people can buy their own insurance. These new options mean people may end up switching health plans, and that could mean switching doctors. But experts on the health care law told us it’s difficult to predict how many will fall into that category. There are many factors at play, including the particular insurance plan, geography and if the patient shops for a plan on the exchange. "Most people are not going to be affected, at least in the short term," said Michael Tanner, a senior fellow at the Cato Institute. "Will it be huge numbers? Probably not. Will some people find they can’t keep their current doctor? Yes." If Rubio wants to protect people from involuntary changes in their doctors, "the best remedy is to abandon the current employer-based insurance system and to provide insurance on some other basis -- e.g., a single-insurer system of the kind they have in Canada," said Gary Burtless, an economist at the Brookings Institution. Now let’s examine the possibilities as it relates to Obamacare: • Employers that offer health insurance: It’s possible that employers will switch their health care plans and that a new plan won’t include some employees’ current doctors in network. But that was already the case before Obamacare. "If the ACA results in more employers switching plans, it is possible that more people will be in a situation where their new plan isn't in the network, but I've seen nothing that quantifies this," Fronstin said. It’s also possible that some large employers could decide to drop their plan and pay the penalty, forcing employees to buy insurance from the exchanges. Also, a small employer who won’t face a penalty could drop their plan, sending workers to the exchanges. But industry experts are not expecting the changes to be particularly widespread. Barry Schilmeister, a health care actuary and senior consultant at Mercer, said that "it's not likely that employers will be making a lot more carrier changes than in the past, if they're keeping their traditional programs (which most are, for now)." • Exchanges: A patient’s current doctor may not be available through some -- or potentially any -- of the plans offered on the exchanges. There are lots of different scenarios here. A patient’s doctor might be on an exchange plan, but the consumer might choose a cheaper alternative instead that doesn’t cover that doctor. If that consumer truly couldn’t afford the plan covering their doctor, we might call that being "forced" to switch doctors, but if someone simply chooses to save money, then they are making a choice. Gail Wilensky, former head of Medicare and Medicaid under President George H.W. Bush, said that there is some truth to Rubio’s claim, because there is the potential for some patients to lose access to their doctor. But she said at this point, it’s not possible to predict how many people that will happen to in the first year of the exchange -- or beyond. "Just like private plans now don’t include all the doctors, many doctors may not choose to be in the plans offered in the exchanges," she told PolitiFact. That "will depend on which companies participate in the exchanges, whether they have a relationship with those plans, and the payment rates that the plan will use for the exchange. Many states have pushed plan premiums way below what the companies thought it would take and may come in with narrow networks to live within those rates." News reports indicate that some health care insurance companies are forgoing some state exchanges, at least for now. Aetna announced Aug. 2 that it was pulling out of Maryland’s individual exchange. We interviewed spokespersons at a few health care companies and learned that United Health plans to participate in about a dozen exchanges, while Aetna plans to join about 14. Cigna currently offers individual plans in 10 states and has chosen half for initial participation in exchanges. This means for consumers who now have a particular insurance company and have to buy a plan on the exchange, "whether your doctor might be on other plans is a crapshoot -- maybe yes, maybe no," Wilensky said. • Medicare: Jeff Johnson, state director of Florida AARP, said that nothing in the Affordable Care Act would force patients on Medicare to switch doctors. Future changes to Medicare reimbursement rates for doctors "could affect doctors getting out of Medicare." However, that has been an issue years before Obamacare. The "sustainable growth rate" passed into law under President Bill Clinton is supposed to set Medicare reimbursement costs but is routinely bypassed by Congress. "The Affordable Care Act did not include a permanent fix to that," he said. Judith Stein, executive director of Center for Medicare Advocacy, said every year doctors decide whether to continue serving patients on Medicare or Medicare Advantage -- and that’s unrelated to Obamacare. With Medicare Advantage, doctors consider how many of their patients are on the plan, reimbursement rates and administrative hassles "It may be your Medicare Advantage plan may not include your doctor next year, but not because of Obamacare. ... That has always been the case and continues to be the case." Our ruling Rubio said that for people who currently have health insurance, "They have a doctor they’ve been seeing for the last 15 or 20 years, they won’t be able to keep going to that doctor," due to Obamacare. Rubio ignores the fact that without Obamacare, patients can lose access to their doctor when their employer switches plans or they switch (or lose) jobs. Some patients who buy health insurance through the exchange could lose access to their current doctor, but it’s difficult to predict how many. We rate this claim Mostly False.

pomt-03066	"Photo ID is not required for those who vote by mail."	true	/texas/statements/2013/oct/01/league-women-voters-texas-education-fund/nearly-all-texans-who-vote-mail-need-not-present-p/	Toward the end of a press release describing the Texas mandate that voters present photo identification at the polls, the League of Women Voters of Texas Education Fund said: "Photo ID is not required for those who vote by mail." Say what? Granted, there is an obvious logistical lurch in requiring someone who mails in a ballot to also in some fashion prove that they are the person whose ballot is being cast. That is, for you youngsters, there’s not yet an instant-check app for that. But still, if the 2011 ID law put in place by the state’s ruling Republicans was intended to prevent voter impersonation, it’s arguably a twist that there is no ID provision for those who vote by mail. As noted by the league, voters going to the polls will be expected to present a photo ID issued by the Texas Department of Public Safety (a driver's license, personal ID card, concealed handgun license or election identification certificate) or by the federal government (a passport, military ID or a citizenship or naturalization certificate). The registration deadline for voting in the Nov. 5, 2013, election is Oct. 7. So, no photo ID for Texans voting by mail? By email, Linda Krefting of Lubbock, who chairs the education fund, pointed out the 2011 law has no provision for photo IDs being presented in connection with balloting by mail. She also pointed out a query and reply on a "Frequently Asked Questions" web page kept by the Texas Secretary of State’s office, which oversees elections: "Does the new photo ID requirement apply to voting by mail? "A. The new requirement does not change the process for voting by mail." Another question and answer on the web page delivers more detail, stating that a registered voter wishing to vote early by mail, which is no longer called "absentee voting," may request a mail ballot by meeting any of several conditions. That is, according to the answer, the voter will be out of her or his home county on Election Day and during the early-voting period or the voter is sick or disabled or she or he will be 65 or older on Election Day or confined in jail though still eligible to vote. Chapter 82 of the Texas Election Code further defines "disabled"; a disability can include an expectation of being in childbirth on Election Day, for instance. Also, a person in jail can be allowed to vote in person at the discretion of the authority in charge of the jail, the law says. By telephone, Alicia Pierce, an office spokeswoman, confirmed that the state voter ID law did not impose photo ID requirements on Texans voting by mail. But there is a photo-ID element to federal law, Pierce said, in that a first-time voter who registers to vote without providing either their photo ID number or the last four digits of their Social Security number will be asked by county officials to send a copy of their ID if she or he requests a mail ballot. By phone, Dana DeBeauvoir, the Travis County clerk, told us local officials must request a copy of a photo ID of such first-time voters in accord with the federal Help America Vote Act, which took effect in 2006. She said the ID copy must be sent back to the county in the envelope holding, but separate from, the sealed mail-in ballot. DeBeauvoir emailed us the county’s notice requesting photo IDs of such voters. Notably, it says that mail-ballot voters are still not required to send a copy of a photo ID if they check a box indicating they are "disabled, in the military or living overseas." DeBeauvoir said that in the 2012 general election, about 3 percent of the county’s ballots for president were submitted by mail. A snapshot of current events: In late September 2013, county elections official Michelle Parker told us by phone that 1,767 of the county’s more than 600,000 registered voters--less than 3/10 of 1 percent--had been flagged to possibly be asked for photo IDs should those voters seek to vote by mail in the 2013 elections. Our ruling The league said: ""Photo ID is not required for those who vote by mail." That’s correct for all but first-time voters who did not present a photo ID number or the last four digits of their Social Security number when registering to vote. Such voters who seek to vote by mail can expect to be asked for a copy of their photo ID, yet even these voters do not have to do so if they are disabled, in the military or living overseas.

pomt-11210	A "catch and release" immigration policy "is a Democrat rule, Sherrod Brown, this is a Democrat rule."	false	/ohio/statements/2018/may/11/donald-trump/ohio-trump-misleads-blaming-democrats-catch-and-re/	President Donald Trump called the nation’s immigration laws a "disgrace" and pointed the finger at Democrats, including U.S. Sen. Sherrod Brown, for the policy he calls "catch and release." "You've seen catch and release," Trump said. "You catch them and then you release them, okay? That's what it is. This is a Democrat rule, Sherrod Brown, this is a Democrat rule, catch and release. You catch them, you release them." Trump said that the undocumented immigrants then wait a year for a hearing and don’t show up in court. Trump made his comments at a tax roundtable in Cleveland on May 5, a few days before U.S. Rep. Jim Renacci won the GOP primary to challenge Brown in November. We found Trump’s talking point that "catch and release" is a "Democrat rule" wrong. In fact, the underlying policy has continued under his own administration. "For decades, across both Democratic and Republican administrations, many immigrants apprehended while trying to enter the country (by land or sea) have been released from custody while their legal right to remain in the United States was being resolved by the courts," said Adam Cox, a New York University law school professor. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com History of 'catch and release' under Bush and Obama "Catch and release" refers to immigration authorities detaining undocumented immigrants but releasing them while they wait to appear before an immigration judge. The practice didn’t start during a Democratic administration, said Guadalupe Correa-Cabrera, a George Mason University political science professor. On the contrary, the roots can be traced back to a U.S. Supreme Court decision in 2001 during the Republican administration of George W. Bush. The court ruled in Zadvydas vs. Davis that the government couldn’t indefinitely hold individuals beyond six months if it’s unlikely that ICE can actually deport them soon. The Bush administration eventually responded to the court order by increasing detention bed space and expanding "expedited removal," said Sarah Pierce, a policy analyst at the Migration Policy Institute. Under expedited removal, apprehended undocumented immigrants are detained and quickly go before an immigration agent. But in reality, the policy of releasing immigrants awaiting hearings didn’t end. Senate Republicans made attempts to stop the practice during Obama’s administration, but the process continued. Two key groups that have been exempted from expedited removal are those seeking asylum and undocumented minors. Those two groups soared during Obama’s tenure. A bill signed by Bush, the William Wilberforce Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act of 2008, codified the process for the treatment of undocumented minors. 'Catch and release' under Trump In January 2017, Trump signed an executive order to terminate "catch and release." In reality, it didn’t change actual policy. In an October Senate hearing, Attorney General Jeff Sessions said "catch and release" was not official policy but was still happening due to a long backlog of cases and a shortage of immigration judges. "It's just the reality that there are so many people claiming and being entitled to hearings that we don't have the ability to provide those hearings, and they are being released into the community, and they're not coming back for their hearings," Sessions said. The White House said that as a result of existing law, more than 107,000 unaccompanied minors had been released since fiscal year 2016. The White House blamed Congress for not providing enough money for detention space. Brown played no particular role with 'catch and release' Trump singled out Brown, likely because Trump was speaking in Ohio, but we found no statements by Brown about "catch and release." During the wave of unaccompanied minors in 2014, Brown called for "comprehensive immigration reform." Earlier this year, Brown supported amendments to boost border security and provide legal status for Dreamers, but the amendments didn’t draw enough support in the Senate to proceed. Brown’s campaign spokesman said that he has never voted or publicly commented on "catch and release." Our ruling Trump said the policy called "catch and release" is "a Democrat rule, Sherrod Brown, this is a Democrat rule." Trump was referring to the practice of releasing apprehended undocumented immigrants while they await a hearing before an immigration judge. Trump misleads by labeling the policy a "Democrat rule" because it dates back to at least Republican President George W. Bush. Under Trump’s Republican leadership, the practice continues. A few factors are at play here, including lack of detention space and the laws about unaccompanied minors. But those factors aren’t in the hands of Democrats alone. Trump also singled out Brown, the Ohio senator, with no evidence that he played any role in the policy. We rate this claim False.

pomt-12030	"Mass voter fraud just discovered, to the amount that could void Hillary’s victory In New Hampshire."	false	/punditfact/statements/2017/sep/15/young-conservatives/website-passes-along-dubious-claims-about-fraudule/	Apparently, the Internet is never going to leave the 2016 presidential race behind. A Sept. 8 post on the website Young Conservatives was headlined, "Mass Voter Fraud Just Discovered, to the Amount That Could Void Hillary’s Victory In New Hampshire." We learned about the post through a partnership between PolitiFact and Facebook to fact-check articles of questionable accuracy. The article said, "Hillary Clinton blew an election she should’ve won with ease. In fact, the former secretary of state lost a rigged election in her favor to a man with zero experience holding political office. That’s how awful a candidate she was. Now, new reports of voter fraud are popping up. The numbers are so egregious, in fact, that Hillary’s New Hampshire victory might not even count anymore." As evidence, the post cited a Washington Times article that said that in New Hampshire, "more than 80 percent of voters who registered on Nov. 8 using out-of-state driver’s licenses, or 5,313 of them, neither had a state license nor registered a motor vehicle almost 10 months later." That’s larger than the number of votes that separated Clinton and her opponent, Donald Trump. Clinton won the state over Trump by 2,732 votes. The claim in the Young Conservatives post is effectively the same as a separate assertion we checked, by Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach. Kobach, the vice chairman of the Presidential Commission on Election Integrity, said, "Facts have come to light that indicate that a pivotal, close election was likely changed through voter fraud on November 8, 2016: New Hampshire’s U.S. Senate Seat, and perhaps also New Hampshire’s four electoral college votes in the presidential election." We rated that False. David Rufful of Young Conservatives told PolitiFact that his site "provides conservative commentary on news reports originating from outside news sources. In this case, we are sourcing an article from The Washington Times and The Gateway Pundit. … A PolitiFact assessment of an article at Youngcons.com would seem to be misplaced as we aren't the original source." However, the post was widely read -- when we looked, it had been shared nearly 55,000 times. So we’ll recap our evidence here. Domicile vs. residency New Hampshire Secretary of State Bill Gardner, a fellow member of the commission co-chaired by Kobach and launched by President Donald Trump, said that the facts laid out by Kobach don’t create proof for the accusation of voter fraud. He said Kobach had fudged the line between domicile and residency, which is crucial in understanding New Hampshire voting law. A state Supreme Court decision has determined that a person can lawfully vote in New Hampshire while holding motor vehicle registration or a driver’s license in another state. In other words, it’s not necessary for the 5,313 voters in question to have become residents in order for their votes to be valid. That’s because eligible voters can be domiciled in the state without having to be residents — something Gardner acknowledged has caused confusion, even among polling officials. Domicile is defined as the place where a person sleeps, more than any other place, most nights of the year, or where they intend to return after a temporary time away. "The basic difference between a ‘resident’ and a person who merely has a New Hampshire ‘domicile,’ is that a ‘resident’ has manifested an intent to remain in New Hampshire for the indefinite future, while a person who merely has a New Hampshire ‘domicile’ has not manifested the same intent," Gardner wrote. College voters Kobach said that residents must obtain a New Hampshire’s driver’s license or register a vehicle in the state 60 days after moving, but that’s limited to drivers of motor vehicles. As multiple articles pointed out, college students are typical examples of people who would drive in another state without establishing residency in New Hampshire. New Hampshire Public Radio’s analysis of out-of-state IDs used to vote in November found that "the towns that see the highest rates of out-of-state IDs used at the polls are all home to college campuses." Kobach was unconvinced. "Being enrolled in a college does not free you from the legal obligation to become domiciled," Kobach said in his testimony. But that’s misleading, as becoming domiciled isn’t as complicated as he makes it sound. A voter can prove domicile using a New Hampshire driver’s license, a vehicle registration in the state, or a non-driver ID or other government issued photo identification that lists a New Hampshire address. But in some towns, providing a form issued by a New Hampshire college or university is sufficient to prove domicile. In Manchester, a voter can prove domicile by presenting a monthly bill, a medical bill, pay stubs showing a current address, or postmarked mail within the last 30 days. Other towns accept similar documentation. Otherwise, voters can simply sign an affidavit attesting they live there. In the case of affidavits, the state mails a letter to the listed address and if undeliverable or ignored, the case gets forwarded to the attorney general’s office for review. The other aspect of New Hampshire law that lends to the confusion is that alongside 15 other states, it has a same-day voter registration policy. "The result is that yes, it is possible and legal for someone to drive into a polling place in a car with out-of-state tags, register to vote, and vote," Fergus Cullen, who ran the New Hampshire Republican Party from 2007-08, told PolitiFact in February. "Of course they have to sign affidavits and they would be risking significant legal penalties if they voted in more than one place or state. The odds of being caught are pretty high." According to the New Hampshire Department of State and Department Safety, 196 people are being investigated as possibly having voted in New Hampshire and one other state — but even that isn’t proof that they did. Other concerns In the meantime, even if the votes had been were fraudulent -- and again, they were not -- the article’s use of the word "mass" is also questionable, since these votes accounted for well under 1 percent of the votes cast for president in the state. The article also misleads when it says that these findings "could void" Clinton’s victory. There is no mechanism for changing election results once they have been certified by the state and electoral votes have been cast. "Once the electoral college votes are certified it's done," said Andrew Smith, a University of New Hampshire political scientist. Our ruling The Young Conservatives post was headlined, "Mass Voter Fraud Just Discovered, to the Amount That Could Void Hillary’s Victory In New Hampshire." The article cited 5,313 votes cast with out-of-state IDs. However, under New Hampshire law, there is nothing fraudulent about them, as a person can lawfully vote in New Hampshire while holding motor vehicle registration or a driver’s license in another state. And even if those votes were somehow declared fraudulent, there would be no way to "void" Clinton’s four electoral votes in New Hampshire. We rate this statement False.

pomt-03233	Says "nearly half of Oregon's children are poor."	half-true	/oregon/statements/2013/aug/16/jim-francesconi/are-nearly-half-oregons-children-growing-poor/	With the State Board of Higher Education handing oversight of Oregon’s universities to independent boards, Jim Francesconi, one of the state board members, recently took to The Oregonian’s opinion pages to note a few of the issues the new custodians will have to deal with. Among them he said, and most importantly, education has to be accessible. "Oregon," he wrote, "must demonstrate that working people and poor folks can still make it in America. Education after high school is the way, but it is out of reach for many children, especially in rural Oregon. Nearly half of Oregon's children are poor." It was the line about the percentage of poor children in the state that caught one Oregonian reader’s attention. Oregon is hardly a rich state -- particularly when the national economy itself is down and out -- but nearly half? That seemed a stretch. We agreed with our reader -- it was worth looking into. Our first call was to Francesconi to see where he got his figures. He said the information came from a 2012 report by Children First for Oregon, an advocacy group. According to that report, "nearly 50% of children are either poor or low-income." Francesconi almost immediately realized his mistake. "In retrospect, I wish I would have said poor or low income." Though there may not be a difference to the average person, there is a distinction between poor and low income as far as the U.S. government is concerned. In order to qualify as poor, a family must make 100 percent or less of the federal poverty level. Low income refers to families between 100 and 200 percent of the federal poverty level. So what does that mean in a practical sense? A family of four living in Oregon in 2013 would be considered "poor" if they make $23,550 or less a year. To be considered low income, a family would have to make between $23,550 and $47,100 a year. (For the curious, the National Center for Children in Poverty at Columbia University has a handy online calculator that can detail the poverty level for families of various sizes living in various states.) If you check the most recent Census information, you’ll find that in 2011 a little more than 23 percent of children (those younger than 18) in Oregon live in families at or below 100 percent of the federal poverty level while another 21 percent live in low-income families. The figures are slightly higher still for young children, or those under 6 years old. Now, if we were just using the government’s definition of "poor" this would be a really easy False. As far as the U.S. government is concerned, about a quarter of the state’s children are poor, not half. But, at PolitiFact Oregon we strive for more context. Plus, it seemed to us that a family of four making $30,000 would likely feel pretty poor even if they didn’t meet the strict federal definition. So, we placed a couple calls to various non-partisan poverty centers around the nation and spoke with some experts. First up was Jennifer Romich, a professor at the University of Washington and founding affiliate of the West Coast Poverty Center. Using the federal poverty level as a strict line of who is poor and who is not can be problematic, she told us. "The federal poverty line is widely seen as too low," Romich said. "Among folks who spend their lifetime measuring poverty, they can agree that the current measure is problematic." It doesn’t, for instance, take into account government assistance or tax expenditures. Plus, the measure, which rises with inflation, was developed in the 1960s and, aside from a couple small amendments, hasn’t been updated since. Romich explained that it "was originally based on USDA reckonings that a family spends about 30 percent of their income on food which was true in the 60s but is not true today." Nowadays, she said, health care and housing costs, for instance, are consuming much more of a budget. Either way, Romich said, families that are classified as low income are still going to "feel economically deprived. … In laymen’s terms, you'd think of this as unofficially poor or close to poverty." Another expert, this time from Columbia University, agreed. "I think that many low-income families who are above the poverty line, but not much above it, are struggling a great deal with paying bills and finding childcare that is stable and affordable and paying co-insurance on medical visits and putting gas in the car," said Sheila Smith, who oversees the early childhood program at the National Center for Children in Poverty. "We like to think that families who are above that threshold of the official poverty line are doing OK. But we know, in fact, that they ... are struggling in many ways." Smith said she and her colleagues at the poverty center look at whether states are actively promoting the needs of low-income residents, they often put the benchmark at 200 percent of the federal poverty level. For instance, does the state set the income eligibility for child care subsidies at or below 200 percent of the federal poverty level. (The cut off in Oregon is 185 percent.) "Families who are at or above 200 percent of the FPL," Smith explained, "still really need that support for income stability." So what is an appropriate way to determine what poverty is and who feels it? Romich pointed us to the work of a colleague who measures poverty with a "Self-Sufficiency Standard." Essentially, how much would various types of families living in various parts of the country have to make to meet basic needs. Diana Pearce, the mind behind the standard describes how it works in an Oregon-specific report from 2011: "The Self-Sufficiency Standard is a measure of economic security that is based on the costs of the basic needs for working families: housing, child care, food, health care, transportation, and miscellaneous items as well as the cost of taxes and the impact of tax credits. In 2011, Pearce determined that a family of four -- with one school-age child and one preschooler -- living in Multnomah County would have had to make $52,989 in order to meet their needs. Now, remember, that’s how much the parents would have to make collectively. That amount would put the family at 225 percent of the federal poverty level. For what it’s worth, that family would also qualify for housing assistance. The National Center for Children in Poverty employs a similar metric for their "basic needs budget calculator." Their calculator, which calculates for families living in 2008, doesn’t have data for Oregon, however we ran the estimates for Vancouver, Wa., and Clark County. According to the calculator, a two-parent family with one school-age child and one preschooler would have needed to bring in $48,523 a year in 2008 to meet basic needs. So where does this leave us? Francesconi said in an opinion piece that "nearly half of Oregon's children are poor." In fact, if you use federal definitions for poverty, about a quarter are poor and another quarter are low-income. But experts tell us that families that are described as low-income still struggle to meet their basic needs and, for all intents and purposes, qualify as poor. Be that as it may, Francesconi was referencing a report that used the federal definitions. As such, his statement leaves out important details and we, too, think it would have been better to say "poor and low income." We rate this claim Half True.

pomt-03059	Among the nation’s 51 largest metropolitan areas, Milwaukee is the "only one" where the poverty rate is more than "four times greater in the city than it is in the suburbs."	half-true	/wisconsin/statements/2013/oct/03/tom-barrett/milwaukees-city-suburban-poverty-disparity-worst-a/	Stating that Milwaukee is pounded by poverty isn’t startling -- unless you state it the way Milwaukee Mayor Tom Barrett did. Seeking support for his 2014 city budget, Barrett met Sept. 24, 2013, with the editorial board of the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel. At one point, he lamented the economic hardship in his city. The mayor distributed a list that showed the ratio of city poverty to suburban poverty in the nation’s 51 largest metropolitan areas, those with a metro population above 1 million. Then he said of Milwaukee: "We are the only metropolitan area in the entire country where you’ve got that ratio higher than four, meaning that the poverty rate is four times greater in the city than it is in the suburbs. Only one. Only one." There’s no question the city of Milwaukee has had some of the highest poverty rates in the country. Let’s see if the measure Barrett uses -- a city-to-suburban poverty ratio -- is accurate. Barrett’s numbers The list Barrett provided came from NewGeography.com, which is "devoted to analyzing and discussing the places where we live and work." It was included with a July 2012 article by Wendell Cox of Demographia, a Belleville, Ill., public policy firm. Using 2010 census data, Cox provided a ratio to show how much greater the poverty rate is in the city vs. the suburbs in the 51 largest metro areas. For Milwaukee, the poverty rate was 29.5 percent in the city and 6.9 percent in the suburbs -- a ratio of 4.3. In other words, the city’s poverty rate was 4.3 times higher than the suburban rate. And, as Barrett said, Milwaukee was the only large metro area with a ratio above 4. The three next-highest ratios behind Milwaukee, along with the city poverty rate vs. the suburban rate were: Metro area City poverty rate Suburban rate Ratio Hartford, Conn. 31.2% 7.8% 3.99 Baltimore 25.6% 6.7% 3.80 Rochester, N.Y. 33.8% 9.3% 3.62 Newer numbers Nearly a week before Barrett made his claim, the U.S. Census bureau released new poverty figures -- for 2012. Barrett alluded to them in his editorial board interview and had commented on them several days earlier in a Journal Sentinel news article. A day after the new census figures, the Brookings Institution think tank posted a report on the 2012 poverty rates. The report didn’t list ratios like those in the report Barrett had cited. But a simple calculation of Brookings’ city and suburban poverty rates shows that both the Milwaukee and Hartford, Conn., metro areas had a poverty ratio above 4: Metro area City poverty rate Suburban rate Ratio Hartford, Conn. 38% 7.9% 4.81 Milwaukee 29.9% 7.3% 4.10 Our rating Barrett said that among the nation’s 51 largest metropolitan areas, Milwaukee is the "only one" where the poverty rate is more than "four times greater in the city than it is in the suburbs." Barrett was correct in citing 2010 census figures showing Milwaukee was the only large metro area with a poverty ratio above 4, but his claim went a bit too far in that the just-released 2012 figures show two areas with that ratio. That did not, however, undermine the thrust of his point, that the Milwaukee metropolitan area is virtually alone by this measure. We rate the statement Half True.

pomt-05334	The Georgia Regional Transportation Authority "concluded that light rail in Cobb County would more than double commute time and would therefore be unsuccessful in alleviating traffic congestion."	false	/georgia/statements/2012/may/15/transportation-leadership-coalition/anti-transportation-tax-group-light-rail-doubles-c/	Metro Atlanta needs to fix its traffic problems, but it doesn’t need rail, a group opposed to a plan to raise taxes to overhaul the region’s transportation system said. The Transportation Leadership Coalition operates the www.traffictruth.net website, which lists reasons to vote against the 1-cent sales tax July 31. One of the top ones is that it won’t help you in a traffic jam. Even research by the Georgia Regional Transportation Authority, which helps create regional transportation policy, found that light rail could make your commute far worse, the website said. "GRTA concluded that light rail in Cobb County would more than double commute time and would therefore be unsuccessful in alleviating traffic congestion," it read. More than double commute time? Then why would anyone in his right mind want light rail? We took a close look at the claim. The referendum is known as the Transportation Special Local Option Sales Tax. It would raise taxes by 1 cent in the metro area over the next 10 years to build or upgrade roads, highways and mass transit. Even if the referendum passes, it won’t fund rail for Cobb County. Local leaders who developed a slate of projects that the tax would fund struck it from the list. It will pay for other rail projects, such as one in the Clifton Road corridor near Emory University and streetcars in and around downtown Atlanta. Transportation tax foes repeatedly use this fact as a reason to oppose it. To find out more about the GRTA claim, we called volunteers for the Transportation Leadership Coalition. They told us they got their information during meetings for the Northwest Connectivity Study, a years-long effort in the early 2000s. The GRTA’s aim was to find out what kind of mass transit system would help locals best cope with their commutes. The study recommended bus service that would use HOV lanes to take them closer to the city’s core instead of light rail or other types of transit, according to news accounts and GRTA study documents. (The bus service never launched. It morphed into a project to build special "reversible lanes" that switch their direction of travel depending on the time of day. Drivers will pay a toll to use them to get around traffic jams.) The study estimated commute times for some of these mass transit options. The HOV lane bus service would take 36 minutes to travel from the Busbee Park and Ride lot in the Kennesaw area to Midtown, according to study documents. Light rail would take an estimated 53 minutes, or 17 minutes more. But it did not compare mass transit trip times to car commutes, GRTA spokesman William Mecke told PolitiFact Georgia. It didn’t look into how these mass transit projects would affect traffic congestion, either. "Therefore, GRTA drew no conclusions as to how much these transit options would impact commute times or alleviate traffic congestion," Mecke told us in an email. Project documents outlining the scope of the study back up this statement. Mecke cautioned that the study’s estimates are old. "That was eight years and another economy ago," Mecke said. Transportation Leadership Coalition volunteer Ron Sifen recalls the Northwest Corridor effort differently. Sifen, who said he supports mass transit, said he was a supporter of light rail until he saw a GRTA presentation in the early 2000s. The presentation compared trip times for car commuters with those of light-rail riders. Sifen said car trips were so much shorter, and light rail was so much more expensive than other options, he decided light rail was a bad idea. We wanted to give Sifen and others from the anti-transportation tax group another chance, so we checked our newspaper archives and other resources for any suggestion that light rail would double Northwest Corridor commute times. We found nothing. We also looked at the GRTA’s yearly Transportation MAP Report, which shows commute times for certain freeway segments. We hoped we could do a back-of-the-envelope calculation for the length of a car commute and compare it with the light-rail time. We couldn’t. It doesn’t show how long it takes a car commuter to drive from the Busbee Park and Ride to Midtown. It’s possible that car commutes could be shorter than prospective light-rail commutes. Trains make regularly scheduled stops. But even if data collected as part of the Northwest Connectivity study, or any other transportation studies in the early part of the past decade, did confirm that this were true, that data would be very old. To sum up: The Transportation Leadership Coalition said that the GRTA "concluded that light rail in Cobb County would more than double commute time and would therefore be unsuccessful in alleviating traffic congestion." The GRTA denied it made this conclusion, and we found no evidence it did, either. The Transportation Leadership Coalition earns a False.

pomt-07136	"The Democrat-led Senate has failed to pass a budget for 750 days ... Senate Democrats have neglected one of their most basic responsibilities."	half-true	/ohio/statements/2011/jun/16/rob-portman/sen-rob-portman-chides-senate-democrats-not-passin/	Legislators haven't stopped using speeches, news releases and snail mail to deliver messages, but they increasingly rely on social media like Twitter and Facebook to make points quickly and constantly, if sometimes too briefly. Ohio's Sen. Rob Portman, for example, sent this tweet on May 17: "We’re in a fiscal crisis, yet the Democrat led Senate has not passed a budget in 748 days." Twitter limits statements to 140 characters, so we asked Portman's office for elaboration. We were referred to a news release posted on his website on May 19. It quotes Portman, a member of the Senate Budget Committee, saying: "It is a shame that while our nation is in a fiscal crisis and families and small businesses are forced to do more with less, the Democrat-led Senate has failed to pass a budget for 750 days now. By failing to pass and live within a budget, something Ohio families and small businesses do on a regular basis, Senate Democrats have neglected one of their most basic responsibilities." If a basic responsibility of Senate Republicans is staying "on message," Portman did his duty. We recognized his point as one that was made the same day by the National Republican Senatorial Committee -- which added a specific reference to Ohio Sen. Sherrod Brown, a Democrat up for re-election next year. "Every month, every Ohio family has to put together a budget and live within their means, yet Sherrod Brown and his fellow liberal Democrats apparently don't believe they should be held to that same standard in Washington," said NRSC spokesman Jahan Wilcox. "Passing a federal budget each year is the most basic responsibility of the Congress, but for more than four years Brown has been content to kick the can down the road and keep maxing out the government credit card. Now here we are after 750 days, and Brown and his fellow Democrats won't even propose a budget, let alone pass one." Updated versions of the one-size-fits-all statement have been issuing from the NRSC since then ("760 days and counting," "770 days and counting"), targeting Brown and at least seven other Senate Democrats. We did some simple subtraction and got back to April 29, 2009 -- which was, according to the Congressional Research Service and news sources, when the Senate passed a budget resolution for fiscal 2010. None has passed since, so the time tally in the statements from Portman and the NRSC is accurate. But we wondered if that meant the Senate, under Democratic control, had neglected its basic responsibility. Our colleagues at PolitiFact Florida had the same question. Building on earlier work by our PolitiFact National colleagues, they found the claim lacks important details. A budget resolution is a policy plan that outlines the intent of Congress, but it is not an appropriations bill, or spending bill, which actually allocates money for specific purposes. In the absence of a budget resolution, appropriations bills have continued to allocate money. The inability to pass the budget framework can reflect poorly on the majority party's organizational skills and/or on the degree of partisan discord in Congress. Since 1983 -- the first year the Senate and House stopped passing two budget resolutions annually and started passing one -- the two chambers failed to pass a joint budget on four occasions. For fiscal year 2003, the Senate, which was under Democratic control, failed to pass a budget resolution. On three other occasions -- fiscal years 1999, 2005 and 2007 -- the Senate and House failed to reconcile their different bills and pass a compromise measure. In those three cases, Republicans were in the majority in both chambers. Jason Peuquet, staff analyst at the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, a bipartisan public policy think tank, told PolitiFact Florida that the lack of a budget resolution makes the Democrats appear irresponsible, though they have continued to allocate dollars as needed through other spending bills "But the larger picture is that lawmakers in Congress and the administration have so far not enacted a long-term fiscal plan to stabilize and reduce the debt," Peuquet said. "That is the true metric of fiscal responsibility, and there is plenty of blame to go around for both parties as to why our fiscal outlook is so dire." While the National Republican Senatorial Committee and Portman have correctly stated the number of days since a budget passed the Senate, their statements are loaded with a certain amount of hyperbole. The claim implies that the stalled budget process is the exclusive fault of Senate Democrats and not a function of partisan politics on both sides. It also fails to note that since 1983, the GOP was in control of both houses of Congress in three of the four years that a budget resolution wasn’t approved. Those are important details to know. On the Truth-O-Meter, a statement that is accurate but leaves out important details can get just one rating: Half True.

pomt-01669	Says Rep. Tom Reed, R-N.Y., "voted to raise the Social Security retirement age on us."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2014/aug/19/martha-robertson/new-york-state-democrats-tv-ad-challenges-gop-cong/	The possibility that Congress could cut back on Social Security has long been a potent weapon in the campaign ad wars. Recently, the theme emerged again in a congressional race in western New York state. It came up in a television ad created by Martha Robertson, a Democratic Tompkins County legislator who is challenging the Republican incumbent, Rep. Tom Reed, in New York’s 23rd district, a sprawling region bordering Pennsylvania known as the Southern Tier. Among other things, Robertson’s ad charges that Reed "voted to raise the Social Security retirement age on us." Policy experts have long suggested a hike in the retirement age as a way to ease the fiscal and demographic crunch facing the Social Security program. The aging of the baby boomers means that fewer workers will have to support more retirees in the coming years. To remain solvent, the program might need to institute higher taxes, reduced benefits or a later retirement age. However, among elected officials, openly advocating for any of these options is considered the "third rail" of politics -- in other words, touch it and you die -- because each policy proposal is so unpopular. This is particularly true among older voters who are reliant on Social Security and who tend to vote at higher-than-average rates. Since most elected officials are on record opposing a higher retirement age, the ad raised our eyebrows. So we took a closer look. On screen, the ad provides a footnote that led us to an alternative budget blueprint offered in 2012 by Rep. Jim Cooper, D-Tenn., and then-Rep. Steve LaTourette, R-Ohio. In 2012, Cooper and LaTourette offered a budget based on the final report of the bipartisan National Commission on Fiscal Responsibility and Reform, better known as the Simpson-Bowles commission, after its co-chairs, former Sen. Alan Simpson, R-Wyo., and former White House chief of staff Erskine Bowles, a Democrat. The Cooper-LaTourette amendment failed by a wide margin in the House -- just 38 lawmakers voted for it, with 382 voting against -- but Reed was one of 16 Republicans who voted for it. However, the accuracy of Robertson’s ad hinges on whether Reed’s vote would have raised "the Social Security retirement age on us." To be accurate, the claim relies on the assumption that Reed was, in effect, voting for what was advocated in the Simpson-Bowles final report. And that assumption is murkier than the ad lets on. It’s true that the Simpson-Bowles report did propose raising the Social Security retirement age. Specifically, it said that after the retirement age reaches 67 in 2027 under current law, the age should be indexed for increases in life expectancy. That would mean upping the retirement age to 68 around 2050, and to 69 around 2075. (Using a similar calculation, the Simpson-Bowles proposal would also raise the early-retirement age at which Americans can retire in exchange for smaller monthly benefits.) Robertson’s spokesman, Seth Stein, told PolitiFact, "Our ad is factual. Congressman Tom Reed has voted for Cooper-LaTourette, which is based on Simpson-Bowles -- and many independent analysts agree that this plan would raise the retirement age." However, the ad’s claim ignores two important qualifiers. The first is that the proposal Reed actually voted for did not include the Simpson-Bowles language on raising the retirement age. Here’s the language Reed and the other 37 lawmakers did vote for: "It is the policy of this resolution that Congress should work on a bipartisan basis to make Social Security sustainably solvent over 75 years. … Legislation to ensure sustainable solvency shall reflect the principles and framework outlined in the bipartisan Simpson-Bowles Moment of Truth report and the bipartisan Rivlin-Domenici Restoring America’s Future report, which … include, among other proposals … accounting for changes in life expectancy over the next 75 years." That language is significantly more vague than what’s used in the Simpson-Bowles report. This may well have been a dodge to shield lawmakers from having to do exactly what the ad accuses Reed of doing, but it does cast some doubt on the ad’s claim that Reed explicitly "voted to raise the Social Security retirement age." Believing that Reed cast such a vote requires connecting some dots in a way that may, or may not, be reasonable. The second qualifier is Robertson’s use of the phrase "on us" to refer to those who would be hit by the retirement-age increase (setting aside whether Reed even voted to do that). Given that the Simpson-Bowles report suggests that the first one-year increase could take place in 2050, no one older than 31 years today would be affected at all. In New York’s 23rd district, roughly 39 percent of the residents are 31 and under, and only about 17 percent of the district’s voting-age population -- the target of the ads -- is 31 or under. So emphasizing the potential impact by using the words "on us" is a bit of an exaggeration. A large majority of those watching the ad would be completely unaffected by a proposed retirement-age increase that never made it into law (and that Reed may or may not have voted for). Our ruling In an ad, Robertson said Reed "voted to raise the Social Security retirement age on us." That’s a stretch. While the Cooper-LaTourette budget proposal was based on the Simpson-Bowles report, which did support an increase in the retirement age, the actual measure considered by the House (and voted for by Reed) was significantly more vague on that point. Meanwhile, even if you agree that Reed was effectively voting for a retirement-age increase, it’s an exaggeration for the ad to say that such a hike was "on us," since a large majority of the district would not have been affected by a policy that was only designed to take effect in 2050. On balance, we rate the claim Half True.	None	Martha Robertson	None	None	None	2014-08-19T17:31:53	2014-08-12	['None']
pomt-03615	Then-Gov. Carl Sanders put 56 percent of the state budget into education, a figure that has not been achieved since.	mostly true	/georgia/statements/2013/may/08/zell-miller/education-spending-under-gov-sanders-touted/	Georgia sometimes gets a bad rap for the amount of money the state invests in education and spends on students. Just last month, for example, a study by a national education organization said Georgia fell six spots to 25th out of 40 states in spending on its pre-kindergarten program over two school years since 2010 due to budget cuts. But the education funding battles of recent budget years were different 50 years ago. In a recent Atlanta Journal-Constitution article about the 1963 Georgia Legislature, former Gov. Zell Miller recalled the strides made in education by then-Gov. Carl Sanders. Miller lauded Sanders for putting 56 percent of the state budget into education -- a figure, Miller said, that has not been achieved since. That percentage seemed rather large, even for the largest portion of state government. PolitiFact Georgia wondered if Miller, who later became a U.S. senator, was correct. Miller, a North Georgia Democrat and longtime politician, called the 1963 legislative session "the birth of modern Georgia." That was the year that the courts ordered that Senate districts be reapportioned to reflect populations, which meant more power for Georgia’s cities and minorities. That 1963 session saw the first African-American senator (Leroy R. Johnson), and the installment of Sanders as governor. Sanders, also a Democrat, became governor at age 37, the youngest in the nation at the time, after running on a platform of a new, modern Georgia. He’s known as Georgia’s first New South governor, and the first modern governor elected by popular vote. He served one term, from 1963 to 1967; ran unsuccessfully for the post in 1970 against Jimmy Carter, then left politics to practice law. In the book "Carl Sanders: Spokesman of the New South," author and historian James F. Cook repeats a similar statistic about Sanders’ education investment: "... he (Sanders) made education his first priority and directed nearly sixty cents of every tax dollar into education." The book passage says that under Sanders’ leadership, 10,000 new teachers were added to Georgia’s schools, and more schools and classrooms were built than under any previous administration. The Governor’s Honors program and the junior college network were started, four junior colleges were elevated to four-year status and a new dental school was established. As for funding, $176.5 million was appropriated for University System construction, and average faculty salaries increased 32.5 percent, moving Georgia from 10th to fourth place among Southern states. "I knew that the more people we could educate in Georgia, the better off the state would be in every capacity, politic wise, business wise, otherwise," Sanders said in a 2007 Georgia Public Broadcasting interview. The kicker, according to Cook’s book: Despite Sanders’ extensive education spending, the former governor left $140 million in the treasury -- the largest amount ever left to a succeeding governor up to that time. In addition to the historical accounts of Sanders’ spending, we also checked with the state Education Department and state budget office for more help. Financial reports of all school systems kept by the Georgia Department of Education were available from 1996 to 2012. Those records showed that one year, 1998, the education portion of the state’s budget exceeded Sanders’ 56 percent, by 2 percentage points. For the available reporting years, the data showed four years -- 1996, 1997, 1999 and 2001 -- where the education allocation tied Sanders’ 56 percent figure. It must be noted that some of the budgets in the Education Department data included some state funding for Georgia schools that was not available during Sanders’ tenure, such as lottery funds. Data compiled and provided by the Governor’s Office of Planning and Budget included information from Sanders’ first year in office, 1963, through fiscal year 2014. The data substantiated Miller’s claim about Sanders’ education allocation reaching 56 percent of the budget, but also showed that the allocation reached 58 percent for schools during his third year in office, 1965. The budget office data also showed the education portion of the state budget either equaled or exceeded the 56 percent allocation from 1964 through 1970, and from 2009 to 2011. Agency officials noted that the data included lottery and tobacco settlement funds. Those dollars weren’t available to Sanders. Also of note, the amounts from 1963 to 1974 -- which covered Sanders’ term -- included money for capital projects, like buying land and building facilities. How was Sanders able to accomplish his education goals? "I had the budget power to put together a package of bills to accomplish what I wanted to accomplish because the (House and Senate) didn’t have their own budget officers," Sanders, 87, told PolitiFact Georgia in an interview from his law office. "I didn’t realize I would be the last governor with that power." So does Miller’s claim get fully funded? He said former Gov. Carl Sanders allocated 56 percent of the state budget to education, a level that has not since been achieved. Historical accounts and actual state education and budget data confirmed Sanders’ allocation levels. The data also showed a few years since Sanders when the levels have reached that amount, but those years included funding, such as lottery and tobacco settlement dollars, that were not available to Sanders. Overall, it is important to note that over the past 50 years, methods for funding education in the state, the available revenue streams and the definition of what constitutes education have changed numerous times. Still, data showed that education has always accounted for more than half of the budget in each of those years. We rate Miller’s claim Mostly True.

pomt-07144	"The cost-of-living increase in Social Security is tied to wage inflation."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/jun/15/rick-santorum/rick-santorum-says-social-security-cost-living-adj/	During an interview on the June 12, 2011, edition of NBC’s Meet the Press, Republican presidential candidate Rick Santorum proposed a reform of Social Security. The host, David Gregory, asked Santorum, "On Social Security, would you raise the retirement age?" Santorum -- a former two-term U.S. senator from Pennsylvania -- responded, "I proposed that back in 1994. I think that's an option that has to be on the table. I think the one thing that we should do is to deal with the cost of living increase. The cost -- I asked a senior everywhere I go, Iowa, New Hampshire, I say, ‘Should we -- what should the cost of living increase be tied to?’ And the answer is always, ‘Well, it should be tied to the prices that we pay for goods and services.’ Well, it's not. The cost of living increase in Social Security is tied to wage inflation. Why is this? Why, why, what does that have to do with cost of living for seniors? Answering his own question, Santorum said, "It doesn't. And so what we need to do is change it from a wage inflation index to a price inflation index. If we do that, you solve anywhere from half to three-quarters of the [shortage] in Social Security over time. So that's one thing we can do. We can do it now. We'll have minimal, minimal effect on anybody at or near retirement, but long-term it creates sustainability for young people who are sitting out there who don't believe Social Security is going to be there for them." A reader asked us to check Santorum’s claim, so we did. The short answer is that Santorum is wrong that "the cost of living increase in Social Security is tied to wage inflation." The long answer is a little more complicated. Since 1975, Social Security has provided automatic annual cost-of-living adjustments, or COLAs, to its beneficiaries. These COLAs are determined by a federal statistic called the Consumer Price Index for Urban Wage Earners and Clerical Workers, or CPI-W. (If there is no inflation, or falling prices, there’s also no COLA, as is the case this year.) CPI-W is a subset of the more familiar inflation statistic known as CPI-U. But both measures are similar, in that they represent "the buying habits of the residents of urban or metropolitan areas in the United States" through calculating the changes in prices for a fixed "basket" of goods. The consumer products used to calculate the two statistics are the same, with the difference coming only from the weighting used to average together the raw data. It’s important to note that despite the inclusion of "wage" in the statistic’s name, it is not a measurement of wages. It is a measurement of how fast prices are rising for a collection of consumer goods. "‘Cost-of-living increase’ has a precise meaning, and the increase is definitely not tied to wages, so his answer is clearly false," said Paul Van de Water, an economist with the liberal Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. But even if his description on Meet the Press was inaccurate, Santorum didn’t get the wage inflation-vs.-consumer product inflation idea from nowhere. The experts we spoke to believed that Santorum had essentially garbled his message. Unlike annual COLAs once you’re in the Social Security system, the initial benefit you receive is indeed determined by an index of wage inflation. Santorum "was probably intending to talk about proposals for slowing the growth of initial Social Security benefits," Van de Water said. "At present, benefits for one year’s cohort of new retirees compared to the previous year’s cohort grows roughly in line with average wages, and proposals have been made to slow the growth of initial benefits by tying it to prices instead of wages." The program could trim costs this way because wages tend to grow at a rate roughly one percentage point faster than prices, said Michael Tanner, a retirement-security specialist with the libertarian Cato Institute. "Such a change would hold future Social Security benefits constant in real terms but would eliminate the benefit escalation that is built into the current formula," Tanner said. "Estimates suggest that making this change alone would result in a 35 percent reduction in Social Security’s currently scheduled level of benefits, bringing the system into balance by 2050. Variations on this approach would apply the formula change only to higher income seniors, preserving the current wage-indexed formula for low-income seniors." Still, it is different from proposals to change COLAs -- the idea that Santorum seemed to be suggesting on Meet the Press. There’s another wrinkle to mention as well. When Santorum reports hearing seniors complaining about COLAs not being tied to "the prices that we pay for goods and services," it echoes a different ongoing debate. Some have suggested that a statisticians could create a more appropriate COLA measure by measuring inflation using a basket of consumer products more like those that elderly people purchase on a regular basis, said David John, a Social Security expert at the conservative Heritage Foundation. In fact, in 1987, Congress ordered the Bureau of Labor Statistics to create an experimental measurement called the CPI-E (the "E" is for elderly) to see whether it might be a better tool for adjusting payouts under Social Security. CPI-E differs from the other inflation measures by giving certain items more or less weight, based on their importance to the typical senior citizen's budget. For instance it gives more weight to medical costs. John said he expects that using CPI-E might be more accurate. But it would also add to the program’s cost, potentially shortening the actuarial health of the program by five years, according to a paper published by the New York Federal Reserve Board. Henry Aaron, an economist with the centrist-to-liberal Brookings Institution, said internal details about how Social Security works "is complicated stuff, and almost no one other than a small cadre of Social Security buffs understands it. Santorum clearly does not." When we contacted Santorum’s camp, they sent us a statement that sought to "clarify" what he had said. "He was not referring to the COLA that we typically think of for Social Security," the statement said. "Under current law -- ‘wage indexing’ -- benefits rise so that the ratio of benefits to pre-retirement earnings -- the ‘replacement rate’ -- stays constant. Sen. Santorum would argue that we need to move to ‘price indexing,’ where the benefit stays constant in real terms but the replacement rate falls. There are several proposals already on the table to do just this, and they would solve between 30 percent and 100 percent of the solvency issues facing Social Security." Santorum’s statement to PolitiFact explains what he was trying to say, but we make our ruling based on the initial statement, since that’s what viewers saw. In this case, Santorum’s original statement -- that "the cost of living increase in Social Security is tied to wage inflation" -- is flat wrong. It’s not, because COLAs for existing beneficiaries are based on price increases for consumer goods. So despite Santorum’s subsequent clarification, we rate his comment False.

pomt-02871	I am "the first Latina to run for governor of Texas."	false	/texas/statements/2013/nov/13/miriam-martinez/edinburg-candidate-least-second-latina-run-governo/	Edinburg journalist and activist Miriam Martinez said on her campaign website that she’s "the first Latina to run for governor of Texas." ¿De veras? Martinez, who recently filed her candidacy for the 2014 Republican gubernatorial nomination, told us by telephone that she based her self-description, which we saw on Nov. 11, 2013, on research into other Texas women to run for governor. She said Democrats Ann Richards, who won in 1990 and lost in 1994, and Miriam "Ma" Ferguson, who ran five times from 1924 through 1940, were not Latinas. Martinez further noted that Republican Debra Medina, who like then-Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison challenged Gov. Rick Perry in the 2010 primary, married into her Latina surname after growing up near Beeville as Debra Parker, as the Austin American-Statesman reported in a Feb. 12, 2010, news story. Toward gauging Martinez’s "first," we tallied all the women to run for governor from 1845 through 2010. Our sources were the 2004-05 Texas Almanac plus historical election results posted online by the Texas Secretary of State’s office. Our sift--which got us to 15 women--yielded one pre-Martinez candidate clearly identified as Latina. (Skip ahead if you must.) After Ferguson made her bids, suffragist leader Minnie Fisher Cunningham sought the 1944 Democratic gubernatorial nomination, drawing 48,039 votes and placing second to Coke Stevenson in the nine-candidate field. Frances Farenthold ranks among the best-known woman to run for governor. Farenthold, who was a legislator, reached a runoff for the Democratic nomination in 1972 and also ran in the 1974 primary, losing both times to Dolph Briscoe. Other hopefuls fared less well. Benita Louise Marek Lawrence of Brenham ran in the 1950 Democratic primary and Johnnie Mae Hackworthe, also of Brenham, who reportedly once unsuccessfully offered three Jersey cows in lieu of the $1,000 candidate filing fee, was in the 1968 Democratic primary ultimately led by Preston Smith. In 1972, the Socialist candidate for governor was Deborah Leonard; the same party ran Sherry Smith for governor in 1974 and Sara Jean Johnston in 1978. Sheila Bilyeu ran in the 1986 Democratic gubernatorial primary, finishing second to last in the six-person field. The 1986 Libertarian nominee for governor was Theresa Doyle. When Richards led the Democratic field in 1990, other contenders included Theresa Hearn-Haynes. And what of Latinas? San Antonio physician Alma Ludivina Aguado garnered 19,273 votes in the seven-person 2010 Democratic gubernatorial primary carried by Houston Mayor Bill White. In a Jan. 4, 2010, press release, Aguado referred to herself as potentially the first Hispanic woman physician to serve as governor. The release said Aguada was born in Eagle Pass on the Texas-Mexico border. Footnote: Several Latinos have run for governor. Henry B. Gonzalez of San Antonio sought the Democratic nod in 1958 before he went on to win repeated U.S. House terms. Laredo businessman Tony Sanchez became the Democratic nominee for governor in 2002 after besting then-Attorney General Dan Morales and others in the primary. Also, La Raza Unida nominees lost for governor in the general elections of 1972, 1974 (that’s no typo; governors through ‘74 had two-year terms) and 1978. Separately, Alonso Veloz was a Democratic candidate for governor in 1968 and Democrats Gary Espinosa and Felix (Rodriguez) Alvarado ran in 1994 and 2010, respectively. By phone, Martinez told us she had not heard of Aguado. Martinez then said that she is the first Latina to run for governor as a Republican. "Perhaps I have to stress that," she said. When we looked a day later, her campaign website newly referred to her as the first Republican Latina to run for governor. Our ruling Martinez said that she’s the first Latina to run for governor of Texas. Election results indicate she is at least the second Latina aspirant behind Aguado, a Democrat who ran in 2010. We rate this claim, since amended on Martinez’s website, as False. FALSE – The statement is not accurate. Click here for more on the six PolitiFact ratings and how we select facts to check.

pomt-14754	"The states have always defined marriage."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/dec/13/marco-rubio/marco-rubio-says-states-have-always-defined-marria/	Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., doesn’t like the Supreme Court’s ruling legalizing same-sex marriage, but he said he won’t work to overturn it if he becomes president. Instead, Rubio told NBC’s Chuck Todd, he would appoint Supreme Court justices who "will interpret the Constitution as originally constructed." Same-sex marriage is not a constitutionally protected right, and marriage laws have always been the responsibility of the states and not the federal government, Rubio said in an interview that aired Dec. 13 on Meet the Press. "If you want to change the definition of marriage, then you need to go to state legislatures and get them to change it, because states have always defined marriage," he said. "And that's why some people get married in Las Vegas by an Elvis impersonator. And in Florida, you have to wait a couple days when you get your permit. Every state has different marriage laws." We wondered if Rubio was right that "states have always defined marriage." Rubio’s statement echoes critics of this summer’s Obergefell vs. Hodges Supreme Court ruling who say the specific issue of same-sex marriage should be left to individual states. Rubio has a point that marriage laws are largely the states' responsibility, such as the permit and license laws he noted. But states cannot make laws that violate the Constitution, and the June ruling legalizing same-sex marriage was not the first time the Supreme Court limited state regulation and, essentially, defined marriage. The most pertinent example is the 1967 Supreme Court decision in Loving vs. Virginia, which invalidated any bans on interracial marriages. The court decided unanimously that these bans violated the equal protection clause of the 14th Amendment. "It is true that states have generally defined who can get married and the process by which it happens, unless those laws contradict the Constitution, as you rightly point out in the Loving case," said Jason Pierceson, a political science professor at the University of Illinois at Springfield and author of Same-Sex Marriage in the United States: The Road to the Supreme Court. "States have primary control in many policy areas, but those powers are limited by the 14th Amendment." Jane Schacter, a Stanford University constitutional law professor, showed us a few more examples of the Supreme Court overturning state marriage laws on 14th Amendment grounds. In 1971’s Boddie vs. Connecticut, the court found a Connecticut law requiring poor people to pay a fee to get divorced violated the due process clause of the 14th Amendment. Seven years later, in Zablocki vs. Redhail, the court overturned a Wisconsin statute barring fathers who were behind on child support payments from getting married. And in Turner vs. Safley, the court in 1987 said a Missouri statute barring inmates from getting married was unconstitutional. "There is no unrestricted prerogative of a state to do whatever it wishes with respect to marriage, Constitution be damned," Schacter said. "But it is always case by case." Pierceson added that the 1996 Defense of Marriage Act, which passed Congress with bipartisan support, is another example of the federal government making a law affecting the definition of marriage. The law, which the court struck down in 2013, defined marriage as one man and one woman for federal purposes, such as tax provisions that take marital status into account. Marriage isn’t the only place where states make their own laws and then the Supreme Court can overturn them if they’re unconstitutional, said Kermit Roosevelt, a constitutional law professor at the University of Pennsylvania. For example, states run their own elementary education systems, but they cannot segregate their public schools because that would be unconstitutional. "You can argue about whether (the same-sex marriage decision) has a firm basis in the Constitution," Roosevelt said. "But it's not out of the ordinary just because it's a constitutional limit on state marriage laws." Rubio’s campaign did not respond to a request for comment. Our ruling Rubio said, "States have always defined marriage." Rubio has a point that states are generally in charge of administering marriage within their boundaries. However, his statement implies that state marriage regulations were untouched by the federal government up until the Supreme Court’s decision to legalize same-sex marriage, and that is not the case. There are numerous 20th century examples of the Supreme Court overturning state marriage regulations that it found to be unconstitutional, including the 1967 decision to invalidate laws banning interracial marriages.

pomt-09971	Obama's "first call (as president) to any head of state was to Mahmoud Abbas, leader of Fatah party in the Palestinian territory."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/may/08/chain-email/one-obamas-first-calls-was-palestinian-leader-and-/	A recent chain e-mail claiming President Barack Obama directed $20.3 million to allow "hundreds of thousands of 'Hamas' Palestinians to resettle in the United States" (which we found was Pants on Fire wrong) includes a common refrain of chain e-mails that Obama is a Muslim (one we've checked before and found was False), plus a new twist. It said that after Obama's inauguration, "His first call to any head of state, as president, was to Mahmoud Abbas, leader of Fatah party in the Palestinian territory." We checked the accounts of Obama's first day and found some truth to the claim. According to a statement from White House spokesman Robert Gibbs, on the morning of Obama's first full day in office, Jan. 21, 2009, the president placed brief phone calls to four Middle Eastern leaders — Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak, Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert, Jordan's King Abdullah and Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas. "He used this opportunity on his first day in office to communicate his commitment to active engagement in pursuit of Arab-Israeli peace from the beginning of his term, and to express his hope for their continued cooperation and leadership," Gibbs said in the statement. "In the aftermath of the Gaza conflict, he emphasized his determination to work to help consolidate the ceasefire by establishing an effective anti-smuggling regime to prevent Hamas from rearming, and facilitating in partnership with the Palestinian Authority a major reconstruction effort for Palestinians in Gaza. He pledged that the United States would do its part to make these efforts successful, working closely with the international community and these partners as they fulfill their responsibilities as well. The President appreciated the spirit of partnership and warm nature of these calls." Palestinian officials on the West Bank bragged that Obama called Abbas first. According to a story in Agence France Presse on Jan. 21, 2009, Abbas spokesman Nabil Abu Rudeina quoted Obama as saying, "This is my first phone call to a foreign leader and I'm making it only hours after I took office." The spokesman said Obama vowed "to work with him (Abbas) as partners to establish a durable peace in the region" and that he (Obama) "would deploy every possible effort to achieve peace as quickly as possible." The New York Daily News wrote a story about the slippery diplomatic slope that comes along with things as small as who got called first. The story quotes a spokesman at the Israeli Embassy in Washington as saying his government had "no idea" who Obama called first; and that the White House was mum on the issue. We also got no response from the White House on the matter. But we think the issue of who got called minutes before someone else is irrelevant. The point is that Obama's first calls were to leaders of this region — all of them. The e-mail may be right that Obama called Abbas first. At the very least, Abbas was among the very first. But consider the context in which the statement was made, to back up the suggestion that Obama is actually a Muslim. Assuming Obama did call Abbas first — and again, we can't confirm that — we do know that one of his very next calls was to Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert. The e-mail conveniently leaves that detail out. Here at PolitiFact, we define a Half True statement as one that is accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of context. We think this claim fits the bill. Half True.	None	Chain email	None	None	None	2009-05-08T16:43:32	2009-05-02	['Mahmoud_Abbas', 'Fatah', 'Barack_Obama']
pomt-06768	Providence's port is "200 miles closer to Europe than any other Eastern port."	false	/rhode-island/statements/2011/aug/21/james-bennett/incoming-economic-development-director-says-provid/	Rhode Island has a lot going for it. Really. But we never knew we were so close, in terms of geography, to Europe. Our proximity was highlighted by the newly named economic development director for Providence, James Bennett, who was hired to give some direction to economic growth in the capital city. During a news conference announcing his appointment, he pointed to one advantage the city -- specifically its port -- has over its competitors. "Providence has got a number of assets. . . . The port [is] 200 miles closer to Europe than any other Eastern port," he said. "We need to, I think, focus on turning that into an economic engine." The statement sent us scrambling for our maps. We're not cartographers, but it seemed to us that Boston is a bit east of Providence. And what about ports in Maine or New Hampshire? We got a list of ports from the U.S. Bureau of Transportation Statistics. Next we tracked down the westernmost part of Europe. Lisbon, Portugal, seemed to be the best candidate. Actually, it’s Cabo da Roca, about 26 miles west of Lisbon. But because of Earth's curvature, that's not the closest point to New England. Dublin, on Ireland’s eastern coast, is 171 miles closer to Providence than Cabo da Roca. Ireland’s western coast is even closer. So we turned to Google Maps, and asked for the distance, as the crow flies, to Dublin (to pick a relative landmark). Here's the result: From Providence: 3,030 miles (and a very tired crow) From Boston: 2,993 miles (37 miles closer than Providence) From Portsmouth, N.H.: 2,950 miles (80 miles closer) From Portland, Maine: 2,906 miles (124 miles closer) When we contacted Bennett, he promised to call us back in five minutes. Four minutes later, we got a call instead from the spokesman for Providence Mayor Angel Taveras, David Ortiz, saying he would handle the question. A day later, Ortiz wrote us to say Bennett "regrets the narrow error of fact." "Mr. Bennett misspoke; he picked up the incorrect information about the Port of Providence’s geographic proximity to Europe in a recent conversation about the port’s assets, competitive advantages and potential to compete with other major Eastern commercial ports for the European market," Ortiz said. In short, Bennett said Providence's port is 200 miles closer to Europe than any other port on the East Coast. The only way that's true is if you ignore the ports in every coastal state north of us. It's not even true when you consider the major port facilities in New York, which are about 155 miles to our west, not 200. So, whether you're looking east or looking west, Bennett's statement is plain wrong. His spokesman may call it a "narrow error of fact," but we hope that when he gives a pitch to a developer in his new role, he avoids such errors, narrow or otherwise. Our compass, the Truth-O-Meter, points to False. (Get updates from PolitiFactRI on Twitter. To comment or offer your ruling, visit us on our PolitiFact Rhode Island Facebook page.)

pomt-05513	"Together we added more jobs than any other area" while I was Dane County executive.	half-true	/wisconsin/statements/2012/apr/13/kathleen-falk/democrat-kathleen-falk-says-under-her-leadership-d/	Democrat Kathleen Falk’s rejoinder to criticism that unemployment tripled during her time as Dane County executive is that she helped create thousands of new jobs. She fleshed out her boast in a campaign TV ad in advance of the May 8, 2012 recall primary. The Democratic winner will face Republican Gov. Scott Walker opponent in the June 5, 2012 recall election. Talking directly into the camera about honesty and transparency and her governing style, Falk says: "For 14 years I’ve brought people together to solve tough problems. Together we added more jobs than any other area, while holding taxes down. That’s the Wisconsin way, and that’s the governor I’ll be." In an earlier item we found the Dane County unemployment rate -- though it was notably low among the state’s counties -- tripled during her tenure, as the Republican Governors Association claimed. But it was not all due to her policies. (A new Walker campaign ad against Falk hammers on the same unemployment figures). But if unemployment tripled, could Dane County have really posted the best record in the state on creating jobs? In the ad, Falk does not specify what types of jobs, but we’ll examine private and public sector ones from March 1997 to April 2011, Falk’s tenure as executive. We’ll compare it to other counties and to metropolitan areas, since she used "other areas" as her measuring stick. If you look at the raw change in jobs numbers for Wisconsin counties in that period, Dane County -- home to fast-growing Madison -- did add "more jobs than any other area." The net gain of all jobs was 48,000 jobs, according to U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics data. Of course, Dane County is home to much of state government and the University of Wisconsin-Madison. Even if you take out public-sector jobs, Dane County led the way with 34,000 new jobs. Meanwhile, Milwaukee County ranked last, losing 43,000 jobs of all types. For part of that time, Falk’s top Democratic rival in the recall, Tom Barrett, was mayor of Milwaukee (2004 to present). And Walker was Milwaukee County executive (2002-10). When we looked at the broader metro areas analyzed by the Bureau of labor Statistics, the Dane County area -- a three-county "metropolitan statistical area" defined by the federal government -- ranked #1 in private job growth and all job growth. What about as a percentage growth? Falk didn’t say "fastest growing," but the county still fares well by that measure. Dane saw 19 percent growth, ranking 10th out of 72 counties, and tops among the counties over with more than 100,000 residents. Of course, jobs are measured differently than unemployment. And in this case, the seeming contradiction -- more unemployment amid more jobs -- can be explained largely by the workforce growing faster than those jobs were created. So Falk is on target on jobs added. But just as in our evaluations on job loss and relative blame, there is more than the statistical side to the claim. Falk credited herself and the efforts to pull people together as the reason for the growth. Is that alone responsible? Of course not. When we rated Half True a Republican Governors Association claim concerning unemployment under Barrett, we noted mayors have some role on job creation programs but that state and national economic trends influence local employment trends to a far greater extent. The same holds true of Falk, who ran a county. In the Half True rating on a similar claim by the RGA on unemployment tripling under her watch, we felt that assigned too much blame to her. The converse is true here; Falk takes too much credit. Her campaign argues Falk deserves credit on job creation because she got federal dollars for infrastructure and community development, created a foreign trade zone to aid export-import opportunities and supported an early childhood program that helps working parents enter the workforce, among other initiatives. We haven’t examined the details of each of those moves, but even if Falk deserves sole credit for all of them, they are certainly not the main drivers of job numbers. In sum, Falk correctly brags about Dane County’s standout record on job creation during her tenure, but exaggerates her role in the trend. We rate this claim Half True.

pomt-08012	"Saturday's shootings reflect a disturbing trend. Mass shootings have become commonplace since the Virginia Tech massacre in 2007. There have been dozens of incidents where three or more people have been fatally wounded. Hundreds have died."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/jan/11/pierre-thomas/week-report-says-hundreds-have-died-multiple-victi/	On Jan 9, 2011, ABC News' This Week with Christiane Amanpour aired a special edition from Tucson, Ariz., the site of a bloody attack on a public meeting called by Rep. Gabrielle Giffords, D-Ariz., that left at least six dead, including a federal judge, an aide to Giffords and a nine-year-old girl. Another 14 were wounded, including Giffords, who is in critical condition after being shot through the head. A local 22-year-old, Jared Lee Loughner, has been charged. In a report, ABC News senior justice correspondent Pierre Thomas tried to put the attack into context. "Saturday's shootings reflect a disturbing trend," Thomas said. "Mass shootings have become commonplace since the Virginia Tech massacre in 2007," in which a single gunman killed 32 and wounded many more. "There have been dozens of incidents where three or more people have been fatally wounded. Hundreds have died." We wondered if mass shootings have indeed been that common in recent years. We looked through some of the major criminal-justice statistical sources, including the FBI's Uniform Crime Report and the Bureau of Justice Statistics' National Crime Victimization Study, but initially we failed to find any published statistics on mass shootings. We eventually reached James Alan Fox, a criminologist at Northeastern University in Boston, who said he had worked on his own with raw FBI statistics over many years and had the numbers to put the claim to the test. For the years relevant to Thomas' statement, here are the number of incidents in the United States in which four or more died in shooting incidents, according to Fox's calculations. (Criminologists told us that the usual cut-off in these type of statistical studies is four victims rather than three.) • 2007: 23 • 2008: 29 • 2009: 27 So, with a three-year total of 79 such incidents, it's clear that describing it as "dozens of incidents" is accurate. And the number of incidents with at least three victims would be even higher -- perhaps as many as five times as high. According to the Bureau of Justice Statistics, 0.12 percent of homicides in 2005 involved four victims while 0.60 percent of homicides involved three victims. If those ratios remain more or less constant over time, then there are about five times as many three-victim homicides as four-victim homicides. Now, what about the suggestion that "hundreds" of people die in such incidents? That, too, appears to be accurate. Using just the baseline of four dead per incident, the numbers killed in mass shootings in 2007, 2008 and 2009, would be 316, according to Fox's tabulations. If the threshold is raised to shootings involving three victims, the death toll could be roughly 1,600. So these facts are correct. However, Thomas' statement lacks some important context. First, Thomas suggested that there was a "disturbing trend," which we interpret to mean a steady increase. But if you look at Thomas' three-year period, the number did rise from 23 to 29 between 2007 and 2008, then fell from 29 to 27 from 2008 to 2009. That's not a trend; it's more like what the experts call "statistical noise." While Thomas didn't refer to trends over a longer period than just three years, the numbers for the longer term are murky as well. To more easily analyze Fox's data -- which goes back to 1976 -- we averaged the number of incidents for each five-year period (or, in the case of 2006 to 2009, a four-year period). Here are the results: • 1976-1980: 20.6 incidents annually • 1981-1985: 16.8 • 1986-1990: 18.2 • 1991-1995: 23.0 • 1996-2000: 20.0 • 2001-2005: 21.0 • 2006-2009: 25.5 The numbers do show a rise over the final three periods, but over the course of 34 years, the trendline shows peaks and valleys. Viewed over 34 years, the direction is not exactly clear. "It would be misleading to suggest that there was some long-term upward trend in mass shootings since 1976," said Gary Kleck, a criminologist at Florida State University. "The exact number are highly unstable, but ignoring small, year-to-year fluctuations, there was no trend one way or the other from 1976 to 2009. Further, if these figures were computed on a per-capita basis, taking into account population increases, the long-term trend in the rate would be downward." Second, Thomas used the word "commonplace" to describe multiple-victim homicides. "Commonplace" is a subjective term, and clearly, even a single multiple homicide is a tragedy. However, the term "commonplace" seems a bit too strong in this context. As mentioned earlier, the Bureau of Justice Statistics numbers showed that in 2005, 0.60 percent of all homicide incidents involved 3 victims, and 0.12 percent -- or one of every 1,000 homicides -- involved four victims. Despite the heartache involved, those are, in the big picture, pretty modest numbers. "Murders are not 'commonplace' in the first place, and mass killings are even less common," said Christine E. Rasche, an emeritus criminologist at the University of North Florida. "We are more likely to hear about them today because of a much more ubiquitous media which quickly brings us news from all over the world. In the past, we were more likely to hear only about local events." So let's recap. Thomas was correct to say that "there have been dozens of incidents where three or more people have been fatally wounded," and he was also correct that "hundreds have died" in such incidents. But its a stretch to say that killings of three or more people are now "commonplace," and it's not clear that there's been a distinct trend upward, either since 2007 (as Thomas put it) or over the past three decades. So we rate his statement Half True.	None	Pierre Thomas	None	None	None	2011-01-11T09:00:06	2011-01-09	['None']
pomt-08155	Says the CBO estimates that fully extending the Bush tax cuts would add 600,000-1.4 million jobs in 2011 and 900,000-2.7 million jobs in 2012.	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/dec/03/national-association-manufacturers/national-association-manufacturers-cites-cbo-suppo/	The National Association of Manufacturers says fully extending the Bush tax cuts will create hundreds of thousands of jobs. On Dec. 2, 2010, the business group issued a statement to show its support for extending all the Bush tax cuts, which are set to expire on Jan. 1. Jay Timmons, the group's executive vice president, said that "manufacturers strongly support extending the 2001 and 2003 tax rates for all taxpayers. According to the non-partisan Congressional Budget Office, fully extending the 2001 and 2003 tax cuts would add between 600,000 and 1.4 million jobs in 2011 and between 900,000 and 2.7 million jobs in 2012." We wondered whether the CBO, an independent group that estimates the cost and impact of legislation, really found that a full extension of the tax cuts would be such a job-creating engine. So we tracked down the original CBO analysis. The estimates come from written testimony by CBO director Douglas W. Elmendorf before the Senate Budget Committee on Sept. 28, 2010. Strictly speaking, the trade group has reported the numbers correctly. For 2011, the CBO did indeed estimate that full extension of the tax cuts on a permanent basis would create 600,000 to 1.4 million jobs, plus an addiional 900,000 to 2.7 million jobs in 2012. However, a couple of caveats are in order. What are the alternative scenarios? The way the group phrased its statement, you might think that the only alternative to its preferred option would be to let all the tax cuts expire. But the CBO ran the numbers under three other options -- a permanent partial extension (that is, a permanent cut for all but the wealthiest taxpayers, as Obama and many congressional Democrats favor) as well as a two-year extension for all taxpayers and a two-year extension for all but the wealthiest taxpayers. The option favored by the manufacturers and most Republicans -- full, permanent extension -- does produce the most jobs. But the Democratic option isn't far behind. In 2011, the permanent partial extension sought by Democrats would generate between 500,000 and 1.2 million jobs, which is about 100,000 to 200,000 fewer jobs (or 14 to 17 percent less) than the Republican option would generate. The picture is similar for 2012. Meanwhile, both of the options for a temporary extension -- for all taxpayers, or for all but the wealthiest -- would produce fewer jobs than either of the previous two options, according to CBO. Based on these estimates, you might say that the CBO data points to the GOP option as clearly the best, since it creates more jobs than any of the other alternatives. But it's more complicated than that. This brings us to the second bit of missing context. What happens after 2012? CBO found that the economic benefits from a permanent repeal for all taxpayers are higher in the first two years, but that policy comes with troublesome side effects after that. In his testimony, Elmendorf argued that without other tax hikes or deep spending cuts, a permanent extension of the tax cuts would balloon the deficit to unsustainable levels. That's especially true if Congress extends the tax cuts for all tax brackets. "A permanent extension of all of those tax cuts without future increases in taxes or reductions in federal spending would roughly double the projected budget deficit in 2020; a permanent extension of those cuts except for certain provisions that would apply only to high-income taxpayers would increase the budget deficit by roughly three-quarters to four-fifths as much," Elmendorf testified. "As a result, if policymakers then wanted to balance the budget in 2020, the required increases in taxes or reductions in spending would amount to a substantial share of the budget—and without significant changes of that sort, federal debt would be on an unsustainable path that would ultimately reduce income. ... Compared with the options examined here for extending the expiring tax cuts, various other options for temporarily reducing taxes or increasing government spending would provide a bigger boost to the economy per dollar of cost to the federal government." When we contacted the NAM, Erin Streeter, the vice president for communications, said, "With an unemployment rate that remains historically high, today’s number edging up to 9.8 percent, we believe the best way forward is job creation. The more jobs we can create, the more economic growth we will see across the nation." But she didn't push back on the substance of our analysis. So NAM is accurately quoting the numbers on the Republican alternative but conveniently leaving out the detail that the Democratic alternative is nearly as good at creating jobs. It also ignores the CBO's conclusion that extending the tax breaks for upper-income Americans offers diminishing returns. On balance, we rate the statement Half True.

pomt-08648	Allen West called Social Security a "Ponzi scheme" and said "this country's got to get on sound footing by destroying it."	false	/florida/statements/2010/sep/15/ron-klein/klein-says-west-called-social-security-ponzi-schem/	What do you get when you mix a Democratic congressman facing a tough re-election battle, an outspoken Republican challenger famous for his rhetoric, and an NPR transcript of an interview with a journalist who recently found himself facing some heat for e-mail comments about conservatives? Those are the ingredients for a disputed TV ad. Here are the details: Allen West, the Republican challenging Democratic Rep. Ron Klein in District 22, is known for his unique and often controversial soundbites. As Klein faces West for the second time in two years in the closely Democratic-Republican split South Florida district, he is trying to use West's words against him by portraying him as extreme. In a Sept. 13, 2010, Klein TV ad, the announcer says: "Allen West has extreme politcal views,'' and then quotes West speaking to a crowd saying: "I'm just honored to be here today with all of my fellow right wing extremists." (The ad doesn't state the location of that speech but the Klein campaign said it was from this July 2009 Broward County tea party event seen on YouTube.) The announcer then continues: "Allen West called Social Security a Ponzi scheme. He said this country has got to get on sound footing by destroying it. And West said that Medicare can be cut. Those aren't our values. Allen West. Too extreme for South Florida." The text on the TV screen reads slightly differently in part from the voiceover: "Allen West called Social Security a 'Ponzi scheme.' Allen West: said Social Security should be destroyed." The text on the screen states that the source of those statements is NPR on Feb. 23, 2010. In this Truth-O-Meter we wanted to explore: Did West call Social Security a "Ponzi scheme" and say "this country has got to get on sound footing by destroying it?" The district, which spans Broward and Palm Beach counties, has a heavy concentration of retirees so Social Security is a hot-button issue. First we turned to the Klein campaign to ask for their documentation for the ad. Spokesperson Melissa Silverman e-mailed us a transcript of a Feb. 23 NPR interview between NPR Fresh Air host Terry Gross and David Weigel, then a reporter for the Washington Independent, an online news publication. The name of the Fresh Air episode was "CPAC, the Tea Party and the Remaking of the Right." Weigel had attended both the Conservative Political Action Conference that had been held about a week before in Washington, D.C., and the National Tea Party Convention, which was held about one month prior to his NPR interview. Around minute 23 of the program, Gross asked: "So is this a fair statement to make, that a lot of the Tea Partiers not only believe that taxes should be cut but that a lot of the programs that taxes pay for should be extremely cut or maybe even abolished, including Social Security and Medicaid, Medicare? " Here was Weigel's response: "That's absolutely true. And they'll put in some caveats about programs that people have paid into for a long time. But, you know, I talked to Allen West, who's kind of the perfect Tea Party candidate. He's a lieutenant - sorry - retired lieutenant colonel. He left the armed services after firing a weapon close to the head of an Iraqi prisoner and getting disciplined for it. "He ran for Congress in 2008. He talked like this and he lost. But he's running again, and he's raised more money than his opponent -- Congressman Ron Klein. And I talked to him at CPAC. He got on the CPAC bill and he said, yes, Social Security's a Ponzi scheme, it's the biggest Ponzi scheme, but I'm not going to get rid of it right away but I, you know, hint-hint, eventually this country's got to get on sound footing by destroying it." We tracked down Weigel and asked him about his comments about West on NPR. Weigel quit his job blogging for the Washington Post this summer after e-mails he wrote critical of conservatives surfaced. He now works for Slate, an online magazine owned by The Washington Post Company. Weigel said he had spoken to West on various occasions in the past -- including at CPAC but also over the telephone. Weigel said he wasn't positive when and where he interviewed West about Social Security and said he doesn't believe he ever wrote an article or blog about West's comments on Social Security. When Weigel spotted the ad, he said he called the Klein campaign to ask for their source of evidence. The answer: the transcript of his interview on NPR. "I'm really confused as to why the campaign would do this," Weigel said. "I think it's an interesting thing to pull to start looking for something. It's weird to quote a reporter's take on a conversation he had and portray it as a quote from the candidate." Weigel said his full statement about West wasn't a direct quote. "I remember 'Ponzi scheme' because that is not a word everyone uses,'' he said. "It's a word a lot of Republicans use. I was explaining what the conversation (with West) was about. I wasn't saying 'here was a direct quote about that guy.' To grab those two things and say those are quotes from him is kind of odd." Weigel said when he spoke to Silverman at Klein's campaign, she asked him if he stood by his reporting. He says he does. "The only thing I can say is I phrased it that way and everyone was fine with it in February 2010. It definitely is what Allen was thinking,'' Weigel said. However, "that's a weird thing for a campaign to do -- use a reporter paraphrasing something." Weigel said since the ad surfaced he looked through some old notes but couldn't find the Social Security conversation with West. We found at least a few articles or blogs Weigel wrote that focused on or mentioned West. Weigel wrote an Aug. 24 profile of the West-Klein race for Slate that didn't mention Social Security with the subheadline: "Florida's Allen West may be crazy, but so far this year, that hasn't hurt Republicans." On his campaign blog, West criticized Weigel who "had the delusional gall to declare me, well, crazy." Weigel also wrote a short piece Feb. 19 on terrorism issues discussed at CPAC for the Washington Independent that mentioned West and a June 23 Right Now Washington Post blog on black Republicans. Neither mentioned West's views on Social Security. We also did a Nexis search for West and Social Security during the past five years and found no articles -- other than a discussion about Klein's ad -- in which West was quoted or paraphrased as stating Social Security is a Ponzi scheme or should be destroyed. We told Silverman that Weigel said his comments during the NPR interview were not direct quotes but rather him recounting what West said. We asked if that was the campaign's only source of evidence and if they still stood by their ad and why. She wrote: "The campaign stands behind this ad. It is an accurate reflection of Allen West's dangerous and extreme views on Social Security and Medicare." We asked West's campaign manager Josh Grodin whether West called Social Security a "Ponzi scheme" and made the comments about destroying it. "I don't have time to go through every video," Grodin said in an interview Sept. 14. "I think the onus is on the Klein campaign. .... I would have to go through dozens and dozens of videos." At PolitFact Florida, we agree that the onus to prove a claim is on the campaign or person making it, but we also do additional research. Grodin asked us to send him Klein's documentation, so we sent him the NPR transcript. "The Klein campaign is citing a claim by David Weigel. A guy who has lost all credibility and has no journalistic integrity whatsoever is making a claim? That's pathetic. There is nothing else to say about that." Again we asked Grodin, did West make the statements? "Has Allen ever called Social Security a Ponzi scheme? I don't know," Grodin said. "Has he ever said we need to get on the right footing by destroying it? No. That's ridiculous." So Grodin denies the remark about destroying Social Security, but the campaign isn't confirming or denying the Ponzi scheme comment On the issues section of West's website, he has a brief description about Social Security: "The critical aspect of Social Security is that we must restore it to the independent trust fund account. Once the politicians moved it to the general operating account, they used it for their pork barrel spending spree. The fact that we are creating a jobless morass in America means there are less workers paying into the system. This is another reason why we need private sector growth, which in turn creates jobs, which will replenish the Social Security fund." So how does Klein's claim stack up? The TV ad said West called Social Security a "Ponzi scheme" and said "this country's got to get on sound footing by destroying it." The Klein campaign relied on one source of evidence: an NPR transcript of an interview with a reporter who now says that his description of West was a paraphrase, not a quote -- though he does remember West using the phrase "Ponzi scheme." We don't think a reporter's description of what a candidate says can stand as the sole source for an attack ad, particularly when neither the reporter nor the Klein campaign can find anything he wrote about West's comments on Social Security. We couldn't find any proof that West said it, and we find Klein's proof insufficient. We rate this claim False.	None	Ron Klein	None	None	None	2010-09-15T18:12:04	2010-09-13	['None']
pomt-09697	Women pay 48 percent more for health insurance.	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/nov/09/louise-slaughter/slaughter-claims-women-pay-48-percent-more-health-/	During a heated weekend debate over the House health care bill, Democratic Rep. Louise Slaughter of New York made her case for the overhaul. In part, she said she supports the bill because of how it would improve women's health care. "We will stop telling women ... that they have to pay 48 percent more for health insurance because ... it is all right to do that because women have different diseases," said Slaughter, who holds the gavel of the powerful Rules Committee, a panel that sets the parameters for House debate. "We want to have an end to that." What Slaughter is talking about is the practice of gender rating; insurance companies routinely charge women higher premiums than men of the same age and health status because, to put it simply, women go to the doctor more often. With policies purchased on the individual market, companies can deny coverage due to pre-existing conditions that are specific to women, such as being pregnant ; these are practices the House health care bill aims to end. There's plenty of evidence that women pay more for health care. For instance, according to a recent report by the Center for American Progress, women ages 19 to 64 are more likely to spend 10 percent of their income on out-of-pocket health care costs compared to men. During their child-bearing years, women are likely to pay 68 percent more on their health care than men, according to the same report. And a May 2009 study by the Commonwealth Fund found that, in 2007, 45 percent of women accrued medical debt or experienced problems with insurance bills. In short, there's little disagreement that women pay more for health care costs than men do, but do they really pay 48 percent more for insurance? We were hard pressed to find the same statistic that Slaughter mentioned on the House floor. We checked with Slaughter's office and were told that the figure had actually come from a document distributed by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's office about how health care reform could help women. According to Pelosi's Web site, "Women are charged up to 48 percent more than men in the individual market. ... These women pay up to 48% more in premium costs than men." Those numbers were pulled from a recent study by the National Women's Law Center, a group that supports health care reform, that looked at how much women who are 25, 40 and 55 pay for health insurance compared to men, according to Pelosi's office. The group found that women age 25 are charged between 6 and 45 percent more than men for identical insurance coverage. Women at the age of 40 face monthly premiums between 4 and 48 percent higher than men's monthly premiums. As Pelosi's brief pointed out, these numbers have to do with the individual market, meaning the consumer bears the entire cost of the plan. The Kaiser Family Foundation estimates that approximately 6 percent of all women buy their coverage through the individual market. The 38 percent of women with health insurance through their employer or the 25 percent of women who get insurance through a spouse presumably face much lower costs. So, while Slaughter's underlying point is correct -- that women pay more for health insurance than men do -- she failed to include some important details in her floor speech. For one, she omitted that women can pay as little as 4 percent or as much as 48 percent more in premiums, so she cherry-picked the highest number possible. Furthermore, Slaughter did not mention that these figures are only for women who buy health insurance through the individual market, which is a relatively small number of consumers compared to women who get insurance through other means. As a result, we give Slaughter a Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.

pomt-09440	Charges on the Republican Party of Florida credit card were made with "my money."	mostly false	/florida/statements/2010/mar/11/marco-rubio/rubio-gop-credit-card-my-money/	The story about Marco Rubio's Republican Party of Florida American Express card has devolved into a game of soundbite one-upsmanship. Questions about whether Rubio charged personal expenses on the GOP's corporate card have produced dueling remarks from the campaigns of Rubio and his primary opponent, Gov. Charlie Crist. Many have centered on whether party money was used for repairs to Rubio's family minivan and the $133.75 Rubio charged on the GOP credit card at a Miami barber shop. We decided it was time to put some of the claims to our Truth-O-Meter. Rubio appeared March 4, 2010 on Fox News with Neil Cavuto to talk about the U.S. Senate primary. Of course, his credit card bills came up. Cavuto told Rubio that Crist has suggested that the charges indicate Rubio isn't the fiscal conservative he has claimed to be. Rubio, in response, brushed the tactic off as a silly act of desperation. Cavuto pressed further. "Well, I guess, others were saying, they're not so silly when you champion a cause that you're going to cut abusive and wasteful spending when they say that you charged grocery bills or repairs of your family minivan, purchases at a wine store, you know where this is going?" Cavuto asked Rubio. "Yes, but here's what they don't tell you, it's my money," Rubio said. "It's a card that was secured under my credit and I made payments out of my own pockets directly to American Express. It's ridiculous. It's not true and it is being put in the worst possible way to divert attention from the central issues of this campaign." The issue here is whether Rubio is correct to assert to a national audience that charges on the GOP card were his money. The answer is, it's complicated. What we know Rubio was among a group of at least a half-dozen Florida lawmakers given GOP credit cards in recent years, allowing them to use party money for certain expenses. The card was intended for party business, "primarily those associated with fundraising, candidate recruitment and other activities related to electing Republicans," according to party spokeswoman Katie Betta. Using the card for personal expenses was not explicitly prohibited, but personal expenses "were expected to be paid through a reimbursement, or in some cases directly to American Express," Betta said. There was no written policy on the use of the cards, Betta said. Rubio, who had the card while he was a member of the state House leadership, used the GOP American Express to pay for both personal and party-related matters. A majority of the party-business charges are related to travel -- airfare, hotel, rental cars. Some other "party" charges, according to a Miami Herald/St. Petersburg Times analysis, include: $765 at Apple's online store for "computer supplies" -- (Campaign says for a computer hard drive and software). $25.76 from Everglades Lumber for "supplies" -- (Campaign says for office supplies such as a power strip). $53.49 at Winn-Dixie in Miami for "food" -- (Campaign says for snacks, soft drinks, and other office supplies). $68.33 at Happy Wine in Miami for "beverages'' and "meal" -- (Campaign says Happy Wine also is a tapas and sandwich restaurant). $78.10 for two purchases at Farm Stores groceries in suburban Miami -- (Campaign says for snacks, soft drinks, and other office supplies). $412 at All Fusion Electronics, a music equipment store in Miami, for "supplies" -- (Campaign says the store repairs computers). Rubio and his campaign say all of the purchases paid for by the party were approved business expenses. Rubio, who also could bill the state for some travel expenses, explained his policy for dealing with the charges in a written response to the Herald and Times, the newspapers that broke the original story. "When it came to incurring expenses, I erred on the side of caution and maintained two operating principles: If it was debatable as to whether the expense was state or Party related, I tried to err on the side of saving taxpayer money by charging that expense to the Party," Rubio wrote. "If it was a question between Party expenses or personal expenses, I would err on the side of protecting Party money by paying personally for those charges. "Whenever I incurred a personal expense, I paid American Express directly," Rubio added. "I was as diligent as possible to ensure the Party did not pay for items that were unrelated to Party business." Rubio says he sent about $16,000 to American Express to cover personal expenses, but those payments were not made monthly. Rubio made no payments during one six-month stretch in 2007. The Herald/Times story also detailed purchases that the newspapers could not determine whether they were political or personal. Rubio, in many cases, was unable to provide clarification. The party, for instance, paid a $1,000 charge at Braman Honda in Miami for repairs to Rubio's family minivan in January 2008. Rubio told the newspapers that the minivan was damaged by parking attendants at a political function and that the party agreed to cover half of his insurance deductible. The party also paid more than $2,000 for him to rent a car in Miami for five weeks while the minivan was being fixed. Campaign spokesman Alex Burgos said that Rubio sent "a $500 direct payment to American Express to cover half of the $1,000 car repair." "The fact is the $16,000 in personal expenditures were paid for by Marco Rubio's money," Burgos said. "The $109,000 paid for by the party was for party business." But not everything adds up. Rubio identified to the Herald and Times at least $1,265 in personal expenses billed to the card between March and November 2008: $1,024 in charges from a Tallahassee property management company, and $241 for a flight to Las Vegas after a relative's death. During that eight-month period, however, Rubio repaid only $982 toward the credit card, records show. Rubio's campaign would not provide a list of all the personal expenses he repaid. Rubio's campaign said he attempted to pay his personal expenses as soon as possible, but sometimes had trouble getting statements to examine from Republican Party officials. Corporate card skinny A key element to deciding whether it was Rubio's money, as he claims, is to know how the American Express corporate card works. Molly Faust, a spokeswoman for American Express, declined to discuss the Republican Party of Florida account, or Rubio specifically. But she did discuss the American Express program generally. Here are some key details: While the business must authorize an employee to be included on the corporate charge account, the employee applies for the card individually. The card includes the employee's name, and has a unique account number. The card isn't a typical credit card. The bill is required to be paid in full every month. If it's not, American Express charges late fees, but not interest. (That means if Rubio didn't pay a personal expense off right away, the party would have to pay the charge, or pay late fees). While the card is designed for business use, American Express doesn't mandate business-use only as a policy. How the card is paid off is decided between the employee and the employer. Employees can send payments to American Express and be reimbursed by the company, the company can pay the bill, or some mix of contributions. Here's a critical point. If the bill isn't paid, the company is liable, Faust said, so long as the employee is following company guidelines. In that scenario, the late payments will not affect the employee's credit score, Faust said. Let's repeat that: "As long as the employee has adhered to maintaining their account and their responsibilities to the company, they are not liable," Faust said. While Faust is talking in general, that's a key distinction in addressing Rubio's claim because there was no real policy regarding the use of the cards. Under that rule, Rubio would not have been liable for any charges -- personal or business. So when Rubio says he paid back about $16,000 in personal charges, it's unclear if he had to, or if he would be penalized if he did not. His money may have never been at stake. Separating party from personal Another key to this discussion is trying to separate personal from party expenses. Take for instance the $78.10 Rubio charged at a Miami convenience store about a mile from his home. The charges were to Farm Stores, small drive-through convenience stores that sell things such as milk, beer, soda and potato chips. When asked about the charges, along with others by the Herald/Times, Rubio didn't specifically explain what he purchased at the convenience store. (Campaign spokesman Albert Martinez told PolitiFact Florida the charges were for office snacks). Whatever it was, the GOP paid for it. Not Rubio. The state party's quarterly financial report lists payments to American Express in its "expense" report. The party itemizes those charges -- though not by cardholder -- in a separate filed called "Other Distributions." If charges aren't listed there, Rubio and the RPOF say, it means he paid for it himself. That means Rubio paid for the now infamous visit to a barber shop called Churchill's on Nov. 18, 2006, for which Rubio charged $133.75. The charge -- Rubio says it was for a $20 haircut and items for a silent auction -- was not on party statements that we could find. But those statements can be difficult to interpret, because the party grouped some expenses together, rather than itemized them. Our ruling To recap, Rubio said the charges were made with "my money." There is some evidence on both sides. On one hand, Rubio is able to document that he made payments to American Express for some items that he declared to be personal. That supports his contention that it was his money. But the fact that there were purchases that appear to be personal, and were paid for by the Republican Party, undercuts his claim. And although the card was under his name, American Express says that in general -- as long as a cardholder isn't violating the rules set out by the company -- it is the company (in this case the party) that is liable for the charges. And the cardholder (in this case Rubio) won't have his credit rating affected if the bill is not paid on time. So there's little evidence that it was "his money," but more that it was really the party's. We rate his claim Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.	None	Marco Rubio	None	None	None	2010-03-11T12:19:35	2010-03-04	['None']
pomt-05665	Says there have been "well over" 54 million abortions since 1973.	mostly true	/new-jersey/statements/2012/mar/18/chris-smith/chris-smith-says-more-54-million-abortions-have-be/	U.S. Rep. Chris Smith has garnered attention for his ardent -- and sometimes graphic -- condemnation of abortion. The Republican congressman, who represents parts of central New Jersey, took to the House floor on March 8 to denounce a new proposal: "after-birth abortion." During his speech, Smith said: "since 1973" -- when the U.S. Supreme Court handed down its landmark decision in the Roe v. Wade case -- "well over 54 million babies have had abortion forced upon them." Now, he said, this "perverse proposal" for "after-birth abortion," or killing a newborn in all cases where abortion is permissible, has emerged. PolitiFact New Jersey will leave others to debate "after-birth abortion." We decided to look only at Smith’s claim about the number of abortions. First, let’s note that some abortion rights supporters contest using words such as babies and children in describing unborn fetuses. Jeff Sagnip, Smith’s public policy director, dismissed that argument, saying "to object to the use of the term ‘babies’ in this context is out of step with common use." And it’s clear Smith was referencing the number of abortions since 1973, so that’s what we are fact-checking here. Sagnip referred us to a report from the National Right to Life Committee, a group that opposes abortion, that claims there have been more than 54.5 million abortions through 2011. The committee’s total is based on data collected by the Guttmacher Institute, a research group that advocates on issues of sexual and reproductive health. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention also collect data on abortions, but states aren’t required to report to the federal agency so the numbers are incomplete in some years. And people on both sides of the abortion debate largely consider the Guttmacher Institute the authority for this type of data. The institute has tracked roughly 49.3 million abortions through 2008 from surveys of abortion providers. The National Right to Life Committee estimates the total through 2011 by assuming the number of abortions in 2008 -- about 1.2 million -- stayed the same. That puts the total near 53 million, a reasonable estimate, according to a spokeswoman for the Guttmacher Institute. But the committee also adds 3 percent for a possible under-reporting rate, which pushes the total above 54 million. The Guttmacher Institute found its 1992 survey overlooked some small providers and suggested that the number of abortions was actually between 3 percent and 4 percent more than reported. In its most recent report, the institute said: "undercounting has likely become more pronounced over the last decade" because of early medication abortions at facilities that don’t offer surgical abortions. Spokeswoman Rebecca Wind said the Guttmacher Institute "acknowledges the potential underreporting in our abortion reporting, but we do not adjust the figures to account for underreporting. Rather, we report the actual number of abortions that are reported to us, so we are confident in this figure. We then acknowledge the level of potential underreporting in the reporting of those data." Our ruling Smith said that since 1973, when the Supreme Court handed down its decision in Roe v. Wade, there’s been "well over" 54 million abortions. The Guttmacher Institute has tracked roughly 49.3 million abortions through 2008. If the recent trend of about 1.2 million abortions per year holds true through 2011, it’s reasonable to assume the total is now close to 53 million. Even by that figure, Smith is close. The Guttmacher Institute acknowledges the potential for underreporting in its data, but does not adjust its figures. The statistic Smith cites relies entirely on the Guttmacher Institute data, except it adds 3 percent to adjust for the potential underreporting -- a calculation the institute doesn’t support. Either way, both totals through 2011 are subject to projections and estimates, and for that reason we rate this claim Mostly True. To comment on this ruling, go to NJ.com.

pomt-10520	"I helped to bring peace to Northern Ireland."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/mar/10/hillary-clinton/a-small-but-significant-role/	Asked what makes her qualified to deal with a 3 a.m. phone call about a foreign crisis, Sen. Hillary Clinton has been citing her work as first lady on issues involving Northern Ireland, China and Kosovo. In an interview on CNN's American Morning on March 5, 2008, Clinton said, "I helped to bring peace to Northern Ireland. I negotiated open borders to let fleeing refugees into safety from Kosovo. I've been standing up against ... the Chinese government over women's rights and standing up for human rights." We'll deal with the Kosovo and China claims separately. Here, we address Clinton's claim about Northern Ireland. Her involvement came when she was first lady. The Clinton administration got involved in the Northern Ireland peace process at the urging of a group of Irish-Americans who believed the United States could help settle the long dispute between Catholics and Protestants. The key U.S. player in the process was George Mitchell, a former U.S. senator from Maine who chaired the peace negotiations. While Mitchell and others handled the direct diplomacy of the peace talks, Clinton focused on women and community leaders in Northern Ireland, according to Mitchell and others involved. She made several trips to Ireland and met with women and community leaders and continued conversations with them after she returned to the United States. She is perhaps best known in Northern Ireland for an Oct. 31, 1997, speech at the University of Ulster in Belfast in which she brought back a teapot that had been given to her in a previous visit. "I don't know whether a Catholic or a Protestant made this teapot. I don't know whether a Catholic or a Protestant sold this teapot. I only know that this teapot serves me very well," Clinton said. "And this teapot stands for all those conversations around those thousands of kitchen tables where mothers and fathers look at one another with despair because they cannot imagine that the future will be any better for their children. But this teapot also is on the kitchen table where mothers and fathers look at one another and say, we have to do better. We cannot permit this to go on. We have to take a stand for our children." But overall, how involved was she? Consider the evidence: • David Trimble, the leader of the Ulster Unionist Party in Northern Ireland who shared a Nobel Peace Prize for the settlement, last week told the Daily Telegraph, a British newspaper, that Clinton's claim was "a wee bit silly." He said, "I don't want to rain on the thing for her, but being a cheerleader for something is slightly different from being a principal player." • The Clinton campaign issued a statement quoting John Hume, the leader of the Social Democratic and Labor Party who shared the Nobel with Trimble, saying "she played a positive role for over a decade in helping to bring peace to Northern Ireland. ... She visited Northern Ireland, met with very many people and gave very decisive support to the peace. ... In private she made countless calls and contacts, speaking to leaders and opinionmakers on all sides, urging them to keep moving forward." • Clinton didn't get much attention at the time. When Mitchell was interviewed on ABC's This Week shortly after the Good Friday Settlement in April 1998, he had effusive praise for President Clinton but did not mention Hillary Clinton. In his book Making Peace, Mitchell mentioned Hillary Clinton only in passing and he did not mention her in his speech when he was given a United Nations Peace Prize in 1998. Interviewed this week by PolitiFact, Mitchell said Hillary Clinton did not take part in the actual talks but that she was "quite helpful in the process. ... She was quite active in encouraging women in Northern Ireland to get involved and stay involved in the peace process." • Inez McCormack, an Irish labor leader, said Clinton played an important role building grass-roots support for the peace process. She said Clinton also was influential in making sure the peace accords included provisions guaranteeing equality based on gender, religion and sexual orientation. "She understood that you had to tackle inequality if you were going to make the peace," McCormack said in an interview. Clinton raised the visibility for issues of equality, which helped them get more support, McCormack said. • Stephen Farry, a member of the Northern Ireland Assembly, said it's important to put the Clinton administration's efforts in perspective. "It is an exaggeration to say that the administration brokered the agreement. ... Most of the heavy lifting to reach the Good Friday Agreement was provided by the British and Irish governments," Farry said in an e-mail to PolitiFact. He said Hillary Clinton "did not, to my knowledge, have any direct role with the key players in the negotiations. She did play a positive role in engaging with civil society in Northern Ireland, and building on work that was already in progress. This would have assisted with the general atmospherics." * In her memoir Living History, Clinton recounts her teapot speech and several other anecdotes about her visits to Ireland and Northern Ireland, but there's little in the book to indicate that she played a key role. Clinton claimed that she "helped to bring peace to Northern Ireland." That's the kind of thing that Mitchell, Hume or Trimble could accurately say. But based on our interviews and research, it's a stretch for Clinton to say so. Although she played a role, especially with women in Northern Ireland, her statement leaves the impression that she was more involved than she was. We find her statement to be Half True.

pomt-00606	"Today in America, 70 percent of us are earning the same or less than we were 12 years ago, and this is the first time that that has happened this side of World War II."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/jun/02/martin-omalley/martin-omalley-says-70-us-are-earning-same-or-less/	Martin O’Malley, the former governor of Maryland and mayor of Baltimore, threw himself into the Democratic presidential contest on May 30, 2015. He begins the race well behind frontrunner Hillary Clinton, but in his announcement speech, he hit some populist notes that sought to separate himself from the political and economic status quo. "Today in America," he said, "70 percent of us are earning the same or less than we were 12 years ago, and this is the first time that that has happened this side of World War II. Today in America, family-owned businesses and farms are struggling to compete with ever larger concentrations of corporate power. … The American dream seems for so many of us to be hanging by a thread." We wondered whether it was true that "70 percent of us are earning the same or less than we were 12 years ago," and if that’s happening for the first time since World War II. When we checked with O’Malley’s staff, they initially pointed to data from the Economic Policy Institute, a liberal think tank. The group looked at the increase or decrease for hourly wages by percentile. That is, it grouped all wage earners into 10 equal categories -- the bottom 10 percent of earners, the next 10 percent, and so on. Using that data, it’s possible to calculate the percentage increase or decrease in adjusted wages over a given 12-year period. If you look at the EPI data from 2002 to 2014, then each grouping up to and including the 70th percentile saw its inflation-adjusted income decline. That supports the first part of O’Malley’s claim. The second part of his claim -- that "this is the first time that that has happened this side of World War II" -- is less clear. EPI sent us data going as far back as 1973, and just using that more limited data period, we found two separate 12-year periods during which the bottom 70 percentile groups all lost ground or saw no change -- from 1973 to 1985, and from 1979 to 1991. So, using the EPI data set at least, it’s not unprecedented since World War II for the bottom 70 percent to see incomes universally flat or declining. The O’Malley campaign also pointed to raw data from the Census Bureau. This data breaks the income spectrum into five categories (rather than 10, as EPI did) and it begins in 1947 and runs through 2013. This data set supports O’Malley’s general point: For only three 12-year periods does the bottom 80 percent of the income scale experience a decline or no change in inflation-adjusted income, and they’re the three most recent periods. Those are 1999 to 2011, 2000 to 2012, and 2001 to 2013. However, this data set does not appear to be the source of O’Malley’s original "70 percent" claim, since the Census Bureau didn’t break down the data to the 70th percentile level, only to the 60th or the 80th percentile. One additional note: O’Malley hasn’t described the data in the most accurate way. Saying that "70 percent of us are earning the same or less than we were 12 years ago" suggests that the data looks at whether specific individuals have seen their wages go up or down. This is known as "longitudinal data," and such data exists (though, due to the complexity of tracking individuals for years on end, it tends to be more limited). Why does this matter? From one year to the next, it’s common for people to jump around from one percentile group to another. The EPI data and the census data miss the income changes these people experience -- the data doesn’t show how specific individuals did over time, but rather how entire percentile groups did from year to year. As a result, we simply don’t know how specific individuals saw their income rise or fall over that period. Maybe this would push O’Malley’s figure higher or lower; the important thing is, we simply don’t know. Our ruling O’Malley said that "today in America, 70 percent of us are earning the same or less than we were 12 years ago, and this is the first time that that has happened this side of World War II." His overall point is valid -- wages did go down or stay the same for the bottom 70 percent between 2002 and 2014. However, using the same data set that makes this part correct, there are at least two earlier 12-year periods that show the same pattern going back to 1973. This undercuts O’Malley’s claim that this is unprecedented going back to World War II. On balance, we rate the claim Half True.

pomt-04544	Says the government has "gotten the TARP money back plus a profit."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/sep/28/bill-clinton/bill-clinton-says-tarp-turned-profit/	The financial crisis of 2008 spawned some new terminology -- "too big to fail" and the Troubled Asset Relief Program. TARP, as it's more commonly known, is the $700 billion in government money set up to rescue banks such as Goldman Sachs, Citigroup, Bank of America, and a host of other financial entities, big and not so big. There were dire predictions on TARP’s final cost to taxpayers. The Congressional Budget Office said it could top $350 billion. But the payback was higher than expected, which former President Bill Clinton mentioned during an interview on The Daily Show. Describing the atmosphere at the height of the financial crisis, Clinton said, "Everybody was all hands on deck and they did a lot of things, including the unpopular TARP bill to keep us from falling into a depression. By the way, you have gotten the TARP money back plus a profit." This is something the former president has said before, so we decided to see if it is correct. It isn’t. "The point about coming out ahead is wrong ," said Paul Kiel who has covered the bailout for the investigative news site ProPublica. "But TARP won’t be as much in the hole as people feared." Clinton is right only if you look just at the money that went to banks. According to the latest update from the Treasury Department, $245 billion went out the door to banks and $266 billion came back. The $21 billion gain came from dividends and gains when Washington sold the shares it held. But TARP went beyond banks. The government put $80 billion into General Motors, Chrysler and GM’s financial subsidiary, GMAC. Another $68 billion went to the insurance company, American International Group, AIG. On a much smaller scale, $5 billion has been used to help homeowners avoid defaulting on their mortgages and other housing market assistance. This is where Clinton’s statement goes off track. The government still has plenty of money tied up in GM, GMAC and AIG. Between the three, taxpayers are looking at about $57 billion outstanding. Once you account for the profit made on the banking side, TARP is $34 billion in the hole. That is a fraction, about 10 percent, of the original estimate. Where TARP ends up is of course a matter of educated guesswork, but most analysts expect the loss to decline further. In March, the Congressional Budget Office predicted the total lifetime cost would be $32 billion. Kiel thinks it could drop below $20 billion. Kiel is bullish on AIG. "It’s extremely likely that all the AIG money will come back," Kiel said, "and it could even be positive." In 2010, Congress capped the program at $475 billion. Looking ahead, the greatest uncertainty lies with the housing foreclosure program within TARP. The government has barely dipped into the $45 billion available and there’s over a year left for people to apply. Whatever is spent will not be repaid. Our ruling Former President Clinton said government got the TARP money back plus interest. That is correct for the money that went to banks. It is incorrect for TARP as a whole. The program remains about $34 billion in the red. We rate the statement Mostly False.	None	Bill Clinton	None	None	None	2012-09-28T10:42:04	2012-09-20	['None']
pomt-12602	"Doctors who discovered cancer enzymes in vaccines all found murdered."	pants on fire!	/punditfact/statements/2017/apr/04/blog-posting/doctors-deaths-were-not-connected-fake-news-websit/	A fake news story tried to connect the random deaths of doctors with conspiracy theories around vaccination. Neonnettle.com posted a story headlined,"Doctors who discovered cancer enzymes in vaccines found murdered," on March 2, 2017. Facebook users flagged the story as potentially being fabricated, as part of the social media site's efforts to clear fake news from users' news feeds. The story claims that the doctors found the enzyme nagalase in vaccines, connecting nagalase to cancer, autism and diabetes. The article speculates that the doctors were murdered in order to prevent their findings from going public. We reached out to the website but got no response. Their argument is that nagalase suppresses the immune system and would therefore be bad if found in vaccines. There have been controversial studies that claim to show that the GcMAF protein, which aims at reduction of nagalase concentration in the body, could be treatment to diseases like cancer, autism, or HIV. These are all diseases where the nagalase level is supposed to be high. That theory lacks scientific evidence, though. The British government has warned against the purchase of GcMAF, since it is not licensed and its production does not adhere to production standards. Scientific journals where those theories were published have retracted them, because they are not proven. Healthnutnews.com identified five doctors it said were connected to the nagalase discovery. But we found little evidence that the deaths of doctors are were connected to the vaccine controversy. Dr. Bruce Hedendal, a 67-year-old doctor in Florida, was found dead in his car in June 2015. The actual cause of his death is not clear, but natural causes have been cited by Florida local TV stations. Hedendal was a chiropractor, and there are no reports that he was involved in challenging the pharma industry in any way. Another doctor from Florida, Dr. Theresa Ann Sievers, 46, was found murdered in her Florida home in 2015. An investigation found that her husband Mark had hired two men, Curtis Wayne Wright Jr. and Jimmy Rodgers, to kill her so he could collect insurance money. Again, her death was not connected to the pharmaceutical industry. In a follow-up article, healthnutnews.com broadened the theory to include two additional doctors. Dr. Jeffrey Whiteside, 63, went missing after a fight with his wife and was found dead. His death was ruled a suicide. Dr. Patrick Fitzpatrick,a 74-year-old retired eyedoctor, went missing while hiking in Montana. The police searched but never found him. A officer of the Gallatin County Sheriff’s office told the Bismarck Tribune that Fitzpatrick may have suffered from occasional confusion, due to his advanced age. He also said that they had no reason to believe criminal activity was involved in this case. The only person who was actually involved in the vaccination debate was Dr. Jeff Bradstreet, 61. He became controversial for his claim that vaccines could cause autism, a theory that has been refuted by several studies. Bradstreet treated his autism patients with the GcMAF protein, which the FDA does not recognize as treatment for autism. According to the Rutherford County, N.C.. Sheriff’s Office, his wounds appear to be self-inflicted. He was not murdered. But his death in 2015 gave way to a wave of conspiracy theories. While the article says these doctors died in connection with promoting theories about vaccines, only Bradstreet’s case even comes close. And even that is a stretch. As for sourcing, neonnettle.com refers to thebigriddle.com, which posted the exact story a year ago. Thebigriddle.com cites conspiracyclub.co as its source, a site that doesn’t exist anymore. Our ruling The article puts forward a conspiracy theory that is based on the actual deaths of American doctors, but there is no information that they worked together on vaccine discoveries, nor were their deaths connected. The conclusions in the article are pure speculation. We rate this claim Pants on Fire. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com	None	Bloggers	None	None	None	2017-04-04T14:00:00	2017-03-02	['None']
pomt-13370	"Not one illness has been reported from raw milk in" Texas "in more than four years. A total of six illnesses have occurred in the last 20 years."	mostly false	/texas/statements/2016/sep/29/dan-flynn/dan-flynn-says-raw-milk-has-caused-just-six-texas-/	CORRECTION, 12:30 p.m., Sept. 30, 2016: After this fact check posted, Rep. Dan Flynn's office pointed out an error. We'd presented all national illnesses and deaths tied to food by the federal government as being linked to raw milk. We've now amended that sentence below to note only the illnesses and a death connected to raw milk. These changes didn't affect our rating of the claim. Thirteen legislators charged Texas authorities with unwarranted interference--in milk deliveries. At issue: Whether consumers may legally designate an agent to bring raw--meaning unpasteurized--milk from a farm to a pickup spot. State law says licensed producers may sell raw milk to retail customers where the milk is produced. Our curiosity was stirred, though, by the legislators suggesting raw milk rarely poses a health risk. After all, pasteurization kills the bacteria responsible for diseases including typhoid fever, tuberculosis and diphtheria. Still, the lawmakers said in their September 2016 letter to the Texas Department of State Health Services: "Not one illness has been reported from raw milk in our state in more than four years. A total of six illnesses have occurred in the last 20 years." Do those counts hold up? The letter, we determined, failed to account for up to 10 suspected illnesses in 2015 due to drinking raw milk. Before then, it appears, there were indeed a handful of identified illnesses. Flynn: Two illnesses in 2000, four in 2011 When we asked the letter’s lead author, Rep. Dan Flynn, R-Van, how he reached his conclusion about no illnesses in more than four years and just six in 20 years, an aide, Kelli Linza, emailed us a chart citing the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The chart included an entry stating the agency confirmed two Texas illnesses, both in February 2000, traced to drinking unpasteurized milk. Linza later told us Flynn also recognized four 2011 cases of salmonellosis allegedly linked by State Health Services to raw milk from a North Texas dairy. Agencies: Seven to 10 illnesses in 2015 Next, we emailed the CDC about such Texas illnesses; spokeswoman Brittany Behm pointed us to its database of foodborne outbreaks enabling us to glean, clicks later, that from 2005 through 2015, Texas had two suspected outbreaks and seven illnesses (but no deaths) attributed to raw milk--all in March and April 2015. Nationally in the decade-plus, the government tallied more than 421 illnesses and one death linked to raw milk, according to our database search. Closer to home, we asked State Health Services about the frequency of illnesses tied to drinking raw milk. Spokesman Chris Van Deusen replied by email that in 2015, "raw milk was the suspected source of at least 10 reported cases of illness in Texas. "As is frequently the case with foodborne illness investigations," his reply continued, "we weren’t able to test the milk consumed by the people who got sick, so we can’t say 100 percent definitively that raw milk was the cause. Often, by the time someone gets sick and an investigation occurs, the food has been eaten or discarded, so there’s no longer product available to test. "Also, it’s worth noting that only a small percentage of foodborne illnesses are diagnosed and reported, so there may be additional cases out there that we don’t ever find out about," Van Deusen wrote. We circled back to Flynn about the reported illnesses from 2015. By email, Linza expressed concern that the suspected 2015 instances of illness linked to raw milk that we found didn’t show up in what Flynn fetched from the CDC in July 2016. Linza, asked whether Flynn asked State Health Services to tally raw-milk illnesses, said she didn’t remember doing so. Separately, Van Deusen affirmatively answered our inquiry about whether the count of 10 suspected 2015 illnesses linked to raw milk would have been available to anyone asking the agency about such illnesses in July 2016, which was when Flynn queried the CDC. National hospitalizations, deaths Nationally, we found in an online search, the Food and Drug Administration tallied 133 health incidents from 1987 to September 2010 due to raw milk or raw milk products, accounting for 269 hospitalizations, three deaths, six stillbirths and two miscarriages. Also, CDC research published in 2012 found that "between 1993 and 2006, more than 1,500 people in the United States became sick from drinking raw milk or eating cheese made from raw milk." According to the CDC study, states where the sale of raw milk was legal had more than twice the rate of outbreaks as states where it was illegal. The 30 states where raw milk sales were legal at the end of the study in 2011 included about a dozen states, like Texas, that allowed raw milk sales only on the farm where the milk was produced. Then again, a chart with the study says the identified outbreaks occurred in 25 states--with no outbreaks in Texas: SOURCE: Study, "Increased Outbreaks Associated with Nonpasteurized Milk, United States, 2007–2012," Centers for Disease Control & Prevention, in journal, Emerging Infectious Diseases, January 2015 (accessed Sept. 19, 2016) We also spotted a nongovernmental website funded by a Washington state law firm that represents food-poisoning victims. When we peeked, the site, realrawmilkfacts.com, had a chart itemizing 2,468 U.S. illnesses and two deaths from June 1998 through October 2013, all attributed to raw milk products. By phone, Bill Marler, managing partner for the Marler Clark law firm, told us the firm doesn’t have a hand in the figures, relying instead on California researchers. In Texas, the chart indicates, four residents took ill with salmonella in November 2010 after ingesting raw cow milk from a farm store. In April 2011, Dallas County’s Health and Human Services Department said a 56-year-old resident had been hospitalized after drinking unpasteurized milk. The agency said that since November 2010, three other similar cases of illness linked to raw milk had been investigated by the state. Previously, per the Real Raw Milk Facts chart, a June 2005 Texas outbreak involved a dozen residents who ate cheese made from raw milk. Before that, in February 2005, two Texas residents took ill from eating cheese made from raw milk, the chart indicates, with another 14 Texas illnesses attributed to raw milk in 2000 and 2003 (when one person died). Our ruling Flynn wrote: "Not one illness has been reported from raw milk in" Texas "in more than four years. A total of six illnesses have occurred in the last 20 years." Government counts suggest raw milk only rarely touched off illnesses in Texas over those decades. However, Flynn presented an incomplete too-low count, failing to note seven to 10 illnesses tied to raw milk that reportedly occurred in Texas last year. We rate his claim Mostly False.

pomt-12144	Says that compared to Rick Baker's time as mayor, Kriseman "had wet weather events that he did not experience" that caused sewage spills. Baker "went through significant periods of drought during his time as mayor."	mostly false	/florida/statements/2017/aug/10/rick-kriseman/was-weather-during-krisemans-term-perfect-storm-se/	St. Petersburg Mayor Rick Kriseman has deflected some blame for the city’s sewage problem onto Mother Nature, saying opponent and former Mayor Rick Baker had an easier time avoiding sewage spills because he didn’t face as much severe rain. The sewage crisis has become the central issue of the Aug. 29 primary election, exacerbated by the 2015 closure of the Albert Whitted Water Reclamation Facility on the downtown waterfront. The decision to close the plant was made by City Council in 2011 and carried out in 2015 by the Kriseman administration. Since the plant’s closure, the city has been whipped by severe storms, prompting the release of millions of gallons of sewage into the bay. A Tampa Bay Times story in June uncovered a large disparity in the amount of sewage spilled during Baker’s two terms and Kriseman’s first. About 1.5 million gallons spilled under Baker in nine years, and 186 million gallons spilled under Kriseman through the 2015-16 summers. Kriseman acknowledged the difference but argued Baker benefited from better weather conditions. "Clearly, there is no comparison in the numbers," Kriseman told the Times in June. "But we also had wet weather events that he did not experience. He went through significant periods of drought during his time as mayor. "When you don't have significant rain events, and you're still having spills, you still need to take a look at your system." In the weeks since that interview, Kriseman has accepted responsibility for his response to the sewage crisis. We were still intrigued by Kriseman’s explanation to the reporter. So we checked out whether it really did rain more under Kriseman, whether there was more drought under Baker, and what effect the weather really played in the system spilling nearly 124 times more under Kriseman than Baker. After consulting climatologists and the campaigns, here’s what we found out: The rainfall under Kriseman was only slightly worse than under Baker. Most importantly, Kriseman’s claim overlooks the consequence of his own decisionmaking and its connection to millions of gallons of spilled sewage. Kriseman’s rain totals The average annual rainfall at Albert Whitted Airport was higher during Kriseman’s term, but not by as much as he made it sound. According to data compiled by the National Weather Service, from 2001-09 the average annual rainfall at Albert Whitted airport was about 45.4 inches. The average rainfall under Kriseman’s three years was about 53.74 inches. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com Average rainfall can be useful to understand part of the story. But excessive rain events (such as high flooding, tropical storms and hurricanes) are also relevant to consider, said Dustin Norman with the National Weather Service, given the underlying issue of sewage capacity. "If you get an inch and a half a day for 30 days that’s way different than 40 inches in one day," Norman said. The city has been hit with several big storms since 2015 when the first major spill of Kriseman’s tenure occurred. In 2015, nearly 15 inches of rain fell between mid July and early August, causing the city to release 31.5 million gallons of untreated and partially treated sewage. Tropical Storm Colin hit the next summer, leading to 10 million gallons being dumped or spilled in June 2016. The worst event for the sewer system was Hurricane Hermine, which swamped aging sewer pipes in 2016 with 8.1 inches of rain. St. Petersburg reported spilling at least 151 million gallons of sewage as a result of Hermine — officials were unable to give a more exact tally because of a broken flow meter. How Baker fared with wet weather events Four hurricanes struck Florida in 2004. Tampa Bay avoided a direct hit but received a large amount of rainfall. The Tampa-St. Petersburg area got 12 to 14 inches of rain in August 2004, which experts said was notably high. "The first part of (Kriseman's) statement, that ‘we had wet wet periods he did not experience,’ may be an overstatement," said David Zierden, a state climatologist at the Florida Climate Center at Florida State University. "I do know that August of 2004 was very wet, with the Tampa-St. Pete getting 12-14 inches that month." Since that is considered high, we wanted to know the typical monthly rainfall total for the Albert Whitted Airport and how many times a month exceeded it. Daniel Brouillette, a climate services specialist at Florida State University, helped us out by compiling monthly rainfall totals from the airport from January 1987 to December 2016. He considered any monthly total that was more than two standard deviations greater than the mean monthly total — 11.14 inches of rain — as "extremely wet." Under Kriseman, five of his 43 months in office exceeded the mean of 11.14 inches (about 11.6 percent of his months). Under Baker, eight of his 105 months in office (or about 7.6 percent) exceeded the mean. So Kriseman experienced a greater percentage of "extremely wet" months, but not dramatically so. Decades of inadequate maintenance, and a consequential plant closure The Tampa Bay Times obtained a draft report by the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission last month that places much of the blame for the city's 200-million gallon sewage spill crisis on the administration of Kriseman, as well as the past two decades of city leadership, which includes the Baker administration from 2001-10. In particular, it pointed to the closure of the Albert Whitted plant in April 2015 and the Kriseman’s failure to reopen the plant to alleviate the sewage crisis after the heavy rains of August 2015. Kriseman and his team have described the rain events of 2015 as "historic," "unprecedented" or a "100-year event." But investigators said those descriptions "were not based in fact or reality," as the amount of rainfall Pinellas received in 2015 happened every 10-15 years, and the greater 2016 amount occurred every 25-30 years. A representative from the commission cautioned that the draft was not official, and said that the investigation is ongoing. How the mayors’ dry spells compare Baker experienced a couple of notable periods of drought at the very beginning and end of his tenure. Kriseman’s team said the mayor’s point about Baker going through "significant periods of drought" is bolstered by Baker referring to a 2002 drought in his 2011 book The Seamless City. "During my terms, the issues that generated the single largest number of complaints came in 2002 during a drought." Baker wrote. Kriseman’s team also provided PolitiFact with a 2007 Water Resources Department memo that talked about water restrictions in the city because of the lack of rainfall. Brian Fuchs, an associate geoscientist and climatologist at the National Drought Mitigation Center, compiled a time series of drought data for Pinellas County from 2000 to Aug. 2, 2017. Yellow bars indicate abnormally dry conditions. (The county level is the smallest geographic point the Drought Monitor can address.) Baker encountered the tail end of the worst period of drought in Pinellas County when he took office in April 2001. The eight-month 2000-01 stretch was the worst drought of the last 17 years (when the Drought Monitor began collecting data). But drought conditions lifted that summer, and there was no drought for the next five years. And after a three-week period of minimal drought for just 1 percent of the county in the summer of 2006, the county remained drought free until January 2007. The county experienced periods of moderate drought in 2007 and 2008, but none that matched the intensity of 2000-01. The year 2009 saw periods of moderate and severe drought but could not be considered extreme, according to the Monitor. Flash forward to Kriseman’s first term. Kriseman’s first two years were relatively normal. Then in late 2016, after the bad storms, moderate drought covered the entire county. "Overall, both mayors had both wet and drought periods during their tenures in office," Brouillette said. Our ruling Kriseman addressed the disparity between sewage spilled under his administration and Baker’s by saying, "We also had wet weather events that (Baker) did not experience. He went through significant periods of drought during his time as mayor." Kriseman's explanation is exaggerated. Experts told us the weather was only slightly more favorable to Baker than Kriseman. Both mayors experienced significant rain events and some drought. While heavy rains played a role in the sewage spills, both the handling of the Albert Whitted plant as well as decades of city neglect put St. Petersburg's massive sewage problems into motion. The statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression. So we rate this claim Mostly False.

pomt-14815	"The actual (construction) contracts that we’ve awarded to date have come in several hundred million dollars below estimates."	mostly true	/california/statements/2015/nov/24/jeff-morales/have-construction-costs-dropped-several-hundred-mi/	LISTEN TO THIS STORY: California’s high-speed rail plan is perhaps best known for its sky-high cost estimates, which at one point spiked to $98 billion. The project’s budget was subsequently cut to $68 billion -- still well above the state’s $33 billion price tag in 2008, when voters approved bond funding for the rail network. But questions about cost overruns continue to dog the California High-Speed Rail Authority. A consultant’s draft report was recently made public and indicated the system’s Merced-to-Burbank stretch could cost $8 billion more than expected. Rail authority officials said the report was preliminary, and hasn’t increased the current budget. In recent weeks, Jeff Morales, the rail authority’s chief executive officer, and other authority leaders, have tried to change the narrative about mounting costs. They’ve started to say that expenses are, in fact, trending down. "The actual (construction) contracts that we’ve awarded to date have come in several hundred million dollars below estimates. That’s the reality of where we are in the program," Morales said during a press conference in Madera in late October, captured in the video clip below. KSEE TV Fresno, Nov. 1, 2015 Several hundred million dollars is miniscule compared with the project’s overall cost. But because the CEO’s statement goes against the project’s past financial history, it inspired us to check the facts. Checking Morales’ claim Rail authority officials clarified that Morales was referring to the project’s first two major construction contracts. We dug out those documents for a look. The first is for a 29-mile stretch of track from Madera to Fresno, including a tunnel and several raised crossings, one over the San Joaquin River. The authority’s lowest cost estimate was $1.2 billion. The winning bid was significantly less, at about $1 billion. The authority’s second major project is a 60-mile leg from Fresno south to the Tulare-Kern County line. It projected the price as low as $1.5 billion. The winning bid was a slightly more than $1.2 billion. Doing the math, the bids were a combined $480 million less than the lowest estimates. That qualifies as "several hundred million dollars." Morales, the rail authority executive, doesn’t call this a ‘savings’ in his statement. He says only that bids came in below estimates, which the authority set for itself. On the right track? These bids are significantly less than estimated. But is that the end of the story? And does this mean the rail authority will see a cost savings? Not likely, said Jan Whittington, a professor at the University of Washington who studies the financing of large-scale infrastructure projects across the globe. That’s because there are always unforeseen consequences. Crews could hit harder rock than anticipated, find an endangered species along the route or encounter unstable soil, all adding to the time and cost of the project. "There’s always going to be something that either the project manager or the contractors themselves did not foresee in design that they encounter during construction," Whittington said. "It’s nice to hear that they received bids that were lower than anticipated. But you don’t know how much it costs until they finish constructing it and it’s begun operating." Still in the hole Steve Boilard, who heads Sacramento State University’s Center for California Studies, said any implication that lower construction bids lead to actual savings is wrong. He said these lower bids do little to remove the bullet train’s overall financial uncertainty. The authority lacks funds for the bulk of the project, which would link the Los Angeles and San Francisco metro areas. "With an overall cost of $68 billion, it just means that the hole that we’re in and having to find money, maybe is going to be a little bit less as a result of these lower bids," Boilard said. Morales isn’t the only rail authority leader to tout the low bids. Dan Richard, the authority’s chairman, recently told Capital Public Radio that that "costs are coming down" for much of the system, in part, due to the bids. In a follow up interview, Richard explained that the authority is using design-build agreements that shift some cost overruns to the construction contractor. He said, however, there is no way for the authority to completely avoid unexpected, added expenses. Our ruling Jeff Morales, the rail authority’s chief executive officer, said in late October: "The actual (construction) contracts that we’ve awarded to date have come in several hundred million dollars below estimates." After digging out the original documents, the winning bids are a combined $480 million below the authority’s cost estimates. That works out to "several hundred" million. Still, the lower bids do nothing to wipe away the overall project’s financial uncertainty, several experts said. Its funding gap remains in the tens of billions of dollars. The implication behind Morales’ statement about the bids is that the authority is either controlling its costs or could potentially save money. Officials probably wouldn’t talk about the bids otherwise. Even the authority’s chairman said there’s no way to safeguard against all possible higher expenses. The phrase "to date" in the CEO’s carefully worded comment may be the most critical going forward. Every independent expert we spoke with suggested future cost overruns are likely for the project. Even so, our fact checks evaluate the here and now, and not predictions. We rate the claim Mostly True. MOSTLY TRUE – The statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information.

pomt-09442	"When we started this health care debate a year ago, 85 percent of the American people had health insurance, and 95 percent of the 85 percent were happy with it."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/mar/10/george-will/will-says-95-percent-people-health-insurance-are-s/	As the debate over health care reform moves slowly toward a climax, Republicans and other critics have argued that the public has made clear its opposition to the Democratic approach. On the Feb. 21, 2010, edition of ABC's This Week, conservative columnist George Will -- a critic of the plan backed by President Barack Obama and congressional Democrats -- cited poll figures about Americans' satisfaction with their own health coverage. "When we started this health care debate a year ago, 85 percent of the American people had health insurance, and 95 percent of the 85 percent were happy with it," Will said during the show's roundtable discussion. "So there was no underlying discontent that you now postulate to drive this radical change." We thought it would be worth checking whether Americans are really so enthusiastic about their health coverage. First, we'll dispatch with Will's claim that 85 percent of Americans had health insurance. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the leading arbiter of the number of uninsured Americans, Will is exactly on the mark. In the last Census Bureau study, 255.1 million Americans had health insurance in 2008, while 46.3 million did not. That's 84.6 percent, or rounding up, 85 percent -- just as Will said. Now, for the polling data. We were able to find eight surveys taken in 2008 and 2009 that asked Americans whether they were satisfied with their health coverage. We ruled out poll questions that asked about satisfaction with the costs of health care, which we decided goes beyond the scope of Will's comment. To conform with Will's formulation, we also ruled out polls that questioned people who lack insurance in addition to those who have it. Our two-year search period covers a longer time than Will's phrasing of "a year ago," but doing so provides us with a much wider sampling of polls to choose from. Typically, the polls we located offered their respondents four or five possible choices. Most common was "very satisfied," "somewhat satisfied," "somewhat dissatisfied," or "very dissatisfied." One poll, sponsored by the Employee Benefit Research Institute, added another category: "extremely satisfied." To determine whether respondents of a given poll were "happy" with their health insurance -- as Will phrased it -- we lumped together the percentages for "very satisfied," "somewhat satisfied" and, where applicable, "extremely satisfied." Here's what we found, poll by poll, in reverse chronological order: • Quinnipiac University, Sept. 2009. "How satisfied are you with your health insurance plan?" 54 percent very satisfied, 34 percent somewhat. Total: 88 percent satisfaction. • Quinnipiac University, June 2009. "How satisfied are you with your health insurance plan?" 49 percent very satisfied, 36 somewhat satisfied. Total: 85 percent satisfaction. • ABC News/Washington Post, June 2009. "For each specific item I name, please tell me whether you are very satisfied with it, somewhat satisfied, somewhat dissatisfied or very dissatisfied. ... Your health insurance coverage." 42 percent very satisfied, 39 percent somewhat satisfied. Total: 81 percent satisfaction. • Mathew Greenwald & Associates for the Employee Benefit Research Institute, May 2009. "Overall, how satisfied are you with your current health insurance plan?" 21 percent extremely satisfied, 37 percent very satisfied, 30 percent somewhat satisfied. Total: 88 percent satisfaction. • ABC News/Washington Post, June 2009. "For each specific item I name, please tell me whether you are very satisfied with it, somewhat satisfied, somewhat dissatisfied or very dissatisfied. ... Your health insurance coverage." 42 percent very satisfied, 39 percent somewhat satisfied. Total: 81 percent satisfaction. • Mathew Greenwald & Associates for the Employee Benefit Research Institute, Aug. 2008. "Please rate your satisfaction with each of the following aspects of your health care. ... Quality of health care I receive through my (health insurance) plan." 31 percent extremely satisfied, 41 percent very satisfied, 23 somewhat satisfied. Total: 95 percent satisfaction. • Mathew Greenwald & Associates for the Employee Benefit Research Institute, Aug. 2008. "Please rate your satisfaction with each of the following aspects of your health care. ... Overall satisfaction with my health (insurance) care plan." 23 percent extremely satisfied, 38 percent very satisfied, 30 percent somewhat satisfied. Total: 91 percent satisfaction. • Mathew Greenwald & Associates for the Employee Benefit Research Institute, May 2008. "Overall, how satisfied are you with your current health insurance plan?" 17 percent extremely satisfied, 36 percent very satisfied, 33 percent somewhat satisfied. Total: 86 percent satisfaction. If you average these eight scores, the total rate of satisfaction is 87 percent. In all but one poll, the satisfaction level was below Will's stated level of 95 percent. One poll, taken five months before Obama was inaugurated, did come up with 95 percent satisfaction. But alone among these eight polls, that survey asked participants about the "quality of health care I receive through my (health insurance) plan." While we decided that the wording was close enough to merit inclusion on our list, the modest difference in satisfaction levels may stem from the way the question was phrased. Many people feel more warmly toward their doctors than they do toward their insurers. So, while one poll with unique wording pegged satisfaction at 95 percent, the average of all relevant polls over a two-year period was eight points lower than what Will cited. However, Will is correct that the levels of satisfaction with one's own health insurance are consistently high. Indeed, they're extraordinarily high, when one considers how rarely surveys find such high levels of agreement among Americans. Since Will portrayed the larger point accurately, even while modestly overstating the number, we rate his comment Mostly True.

pomt-00789	"Just two weeks ago, Congressman Hurd quit his post on the House Committee on Small Business saying that he was unable to find the time to serve."	half-true	/texas/statements/2015/apr/07/pete-gallego/pete-gallego-re-seeking-seat-says-will-hurd-quit-h/	Democrat Pete Gallego, who lost his U.S. House seat to Republican Will Hurd in 2014, seeks a 2016 rematch. A reason for voters to change sides, Gallego said in an April 2, 2015, email blast, is that Hurd evidently doesn’t have time to fulfill his duties. "Just two weeks ago, Congressman Hurd quit his post on the House Committee on Small Business saying that he was unable to find the time to serve," Gallego said. We were curious about Gallego’s charge. Is freshman Hurd short of time? Resignation letter Gallego’s campaign spokesman, Anthony Gutierrez, responded to us by email by pointing out a March 2015 entry in the Congressional Record showing that Hurd, a former CIA officer, asked to be removed from the committee in a letter to House Speaker John Boehner. Hurd’s letter, dated March 16, 2015, said: "I write today to resign from the House Small Business Committee. While I appreciate the honor of being appointed, in order to best serve the constituent of Texas' 23rd Congressional District, I believe I must focus on my existing committee assignments. "With my background in the intelligence community cybersecurity, and representing the district with the largest length of U.S.-Mexico Border, my ability to focus on my Information Technology Subcommittee Chairmanship and Border and Maritime Subcommittee Vice-Chairmanship is where I believe I can be of most value to my constituents and colleagues in the House. "I appreciate your timely consideration of this request." According to the CR entry, the Texan’s resignation was accepted the same day. Hurd's committee assignments We looked next into Hurd's workload. His House website says Hurd serves on the House Homeland Security Committee; he’s vice chair of its Border and Maritime Security Subcommittee and also serves on its Counterterrorism and Intelligence Subcommittee. Hurd also serves on the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform for which he chairs its Information Technology subcommittee; his appointment to the chairmanship was described as a plum prize in a February 2015 San Antonio Express-News news story pointed out to us by Shana Teehan, Hurd’s communications director. Hurd also serves on the oversight panel’s National Security Subcommittee. An online search led us to a web page created by the House clerk, dated Feb. 10, 2015, listing each member’s committee assignments. That list showed Hurd as a member of the small business panel plus the two others. Counting Hurd, six Texas members of the House were assigned to three committees each; the other 30 Texans had one or two assignments. And as of April 7, 2015, Hurd was still listed as a member of all three panels on another House clerk’s web page. (Previously, Gallego was a member of two committees.) Hurd campaign elaborates By phone, Hurd campaign spokesman Josh Robinson said Hurd initially learned of his appointment to the small business panel from a committee-issued press release. The panel’s Jan. 21, 2015, announcement listed Hurd among 14 committee members. According to the committee's calendar, the panel subsequently met three times before Hurd resigned. Hurd appreciated the appointment, Robinson told us, but given his other assignments and desire to travel back and forth to the vast 23rd Congressional District, he decided "being in another committee meeting in D.C. was not going to be helpful." Hurd, Robinson said, would rather focus on small businesses in his district than "listen to a bunch of bureaucrats" in hearings. Chairman Chabot: 'Procedural glitch' By email, Teehan provided a statement she described as obtained by Hurd’s office about March 18, 2015, from Rep. Steve Chabot, R-Ohio, who chairs the small business panel. Chabot, praising Hurd’s energy and enthusiasm, is quoted saying that even though "a procedural glitch means it is necessary to change his committee assignments, I know he’ll be a dedicated voice for working Americans across his district." Teehan also emailed Rep. Lamar Smith’s description of Hurd’s appointment to the small business panel as "a small administrative matter that has now been corrected." Smith, R-San Antonio, serves on the House Republican Steering Committee, which Teehan described as responsible for Republican committee assignments. Glitch? Administrative error? We left messages for aides to Chabot and Smith seeking elaboration while wondering how this might pertain to Hurd’s departure from the committee. We didn’t hear back. Next, we filled in Gallego’s adviser, Gutierrez, who pointed out by email that House committee assignments, including Hurd’s appointment to the small business committee, were entered into the Congressional Record on Jan. 13, 2015--eight days before the mentioned press release came out and about two months before Hurd submitted his letter to leave the committee. Our ruling Gallego said Hurd recently "quit his post on the House Committee on Small Business saying that he was unable to find the time to serve." Hurd, who separately had two other committee assignments, quit the small-business panel stressing his desire to focus on security-related subcommittee assignments. Gallego’s statement, leaving the impression Hurd said he lacked time to serve, left out important details. We rate his claim Half True.

pomt-09868	Under President George W. Bush, the U.S. "spent $1.3 trillion on tax cuts for the wealthy" and "trillions" each on a war and on Medicare drug benefits.	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/aug/05/donna-brazile/donna-brazile-says-bush-spent-13-trillion-tax-cuts/	Republicans have been attacking President Barack Obama for proposing an expensive health care overhaul on top of a costly economic stimulus. But some Democrats have been growing frustrated at the GOP attacks, saying that the same Republican Party agreed to massive spending and deficits when it controlled the presidency and Congress. Donna Brazile, a Democratic strategist and pundit, gave voice to these frustrations on Aug. 2, 2009, on CNN’s State of the Union. "The Bush administration doubled the national debt and it did not help the middle class with the basics of their everyday living," Brazile said. "So we're all concerned about the deficit, but this is needed investment to ensure that we give Americans who have lost their jobs a lifeline, whether it's providing food stamps, whether it's giving states (money to continue) Medicaid funding, or giving these American workers the ability to go out there and retrain and retool themselves." She continued, “We spent $1.3 trillion on tax cuts for the wealthy that we could not afford. We spent trillions on a war that we could not afford. We spent trillions on Medicare with the expensive program that gives money to the drug companies, and nobody raised a peep about the deficit.” We won’t pass judgment on the more subjective issue of whether the tax cuts, the war costs or the Medicare drug plan were, as Brazile, claims, unaffordable. But we think it’s worth checking to see whether Brazile did the math right. We'll take her assertions one by one. On the tax cuts, Brazile was right: President George W. Bush’s 2001 tax package was expected to reduce federal revenues by roughly $1.3 trillion, according to Congress’ Joint Committee on Taxation, the key arbiter for the cost of tax legislation. Brazile also asserted that the Bush tax cuts were for the wealthy. The Joint Committee on Taxation found the changes in the tax rates were roughly the same among different groups, but analyses using other measurements have found a disproportionate benefit to wealthier Americans; even supporters of the tax cuts conceded that the rich, under a system of progressive taxation, already paid a large share of the tax burden, and thus reaped a disproportionate share of the gains when taxes were cut. The Tax Policy Center, a joint project of the centrist-to-liberal Urban Institute and Brookings Institution, looked at all of the Bush-backed tax cuts enacted between 2001 and 2008 and found that the richest one-fifth of the population saw its after-tax income rise by 5.4 percent, compared to 0.7 percent for the bottom one-fifth. Meanwhile, the richest 1 percent saw its after-tax income rise by 7.3 percent. Brazile’s second claim was that "a war" cost trillions of dollars. She wasn't specific about which war, but since most assessments of this question have combined the costs for the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan — in part because untangling those costs is so difficult — we'll look at them together. A partial answer to this question comes from a May 15, 2009, report by the Congressional Research Service, “The Cost of Iraq, Afghanistan and Other Global War on Terror Operations Since 9/11.” That report found that $864 billion had been spent for “military operations, base security, reconstruction, foreign aid, embassy costs and veterans’ health care.” That number can be updated to take into account the slightly more than $77 billion allocated for ongoing war operations in May, when Obama signed a supplemental war spending bill. Finally, one can also include the $130 billion sought by the president for regular fiscal year 2010 for operations in Afghanistan. In all, these three numbers add to about $1.07 trillion — crossing the 13-digit threshold, but not reaching the multiple "trillions" suggested by Brazile. Some budget analysts believe future costs will ultimately hike the overall pricetag into the trillions. Former Clinton administration economic adviser and Nobel laureate Joseph Stiglitz, writing with Harvard University scholar Linda J. Bilmes, published a book last year titled The Three Trillion Dollar War: The True Cost of the Iraq Conflict . It includes $700 billion for veterans’ costs that exceed peacetime levels, including disability payments and health care coverage; $1 trillion for the interest on funds borrowed to finance the war; and another $1 trillion to cover the loss of life and severe disability caused by the war, including the provision of caregivers for wounded veterans and the removal of productive assets from the economy. Economists we spoke with said it's reasonable to include those costs in the ultimate pricetag. But most of that additional money has not yet been "spent," as Brazile claimed. Finally, we looked at how much the Medicare drug plan has cost the taxpayers. According to the 2008 annual report of the Medicare Board of Trustees, a total of $549 billion is expected to be spent on the program in fiscal years 2006 through 2015. (Budget wonks take note: We did not include the full amount paid out by the drug plan, but rather took that number and subtracted the costs footed by beneficiary premiums and transfers from the states. Our number includes what was actually paid by the taxpayers through the general treasury.) Because costs for the program are expected to rise as the years go on, the total amount spent will eventually cross the $1 trillion threshold. But during the standard, 10-year budget window, the amount only gets a little more than halfway to that level. And it will be many, many years before it hits "trillions," as Brazile suggested. So she is incorrect to say that amount has been spent. So let’s recap. The numbers support her broad point that there was lots of spending when Republicans controlled the White House and Congress. But individually, the accuracy of her assertions is more mixed. Brazile correctly described the cost of the 2001 Bush tax cut, but she overstated the cost of the wars. Although the pricetag may ultimately be trillions, that hasn't been spent yet. And she exaggerated the 10-year cost of the Medicare drug plan. So we rate her claim Half True.

pomt-12486	Poor people pay "in some cases, up to 25 percent of (their) income for water."	mostly true	/global-news/statements/2017/may/01/matt-damon/matt-damon-some-pay-25-their-income-water/	Hollywood star Matt Damon has been a champion of bringing clean water and sanitation to the world’s poor for many years, co-founding the group Water.org. The organization links families to microloans so they can tap into safe water supplies. In a conversation with the president of the World Bank, Damon tried to convey a sense of the severity of the problem. "The poor often pay more for water than the middle class," Damon said. "These people have no savings, but they’re paying every day, in some cases, up to 25 percent of their income just for water." People who live in poverty always spend most if not every penny of what little they earn on basic necessities. That is part of the crushing reality of being poor. But we wanted to know about the fraction of their income that goes toward water. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com Rosemary Gudelj, spokeswoman for Water.org, told us the statistic was based somewhat on anecdotal evidence. Gudelj said Damon drew on the work of the group’s co-founder Gary White. "Gary’s statement has been, ‘I have met people who pay up to 25 percent of their income on water,’ " Gudelj said. "This comes from Gary’s experience in Tegucigalpa, Honduras, when doing research for his master’s thesis." That might not seem like much to hang a claim on, but we did find a 2006 United Nations Development Program estimate that confirmed Damon’s point. "In Uganda water payments represent as much as 22 percent of the average income of urban households in the poorest 20 percent of the income distribution," the report said. The report went on to say that in countries such as Argentina, El Salvador and Jamaica, the bottom fifth of households were spending over 10 percent of their money on water. The core problem, the report said, is the poorest families often pay the highest prices for water because they aren’t connected to the pipes that provide service to middle class and wealthy homes: "In Jakarta, Lima, Manila and Nairobi households living in slums and low-­income settlements typically pay 5–10 times or more for their water than high-income residents of the same city. In Manila an estimated 4 million people receive water resold through kiosks, pushcart vendors or tanker deliveries." Each of those middlemen take their cut, and the cost of water rises accordingly. Now, that United Nations report is a decade old and progress has been made since. But Damon avoided hard numbers and the risk that some would be outdated. Taken at face value, he only said that some people pay as much as 25 percent of their income on water. To know the reality, the gold standard would be household spending surveys from a range of countries. But it looks like current ones for water expenditures don’t exist. A report from the advocacy group WaterAid used a baseline assumption that someone was buying the 50 liters/day minimum for drinking water and and sanitation set by the World Health Organization in compiling hypothetical water bills for many countries. But Michael Hanemann, an economist who specializes in water at the University of California Berkeley, said that’s a dicey set of calculations. "In economics it is the case that when something is expensive, people buy less of it," he told PolitiFact. "It is more likely that they are getting by with less water." Or as likely, they are using unclean water, and paying the price with illness and bad health. By the way, the average water and sewer bill in the United States is about 0.5 percent of household income, according to the Environmental Protection Agency. Our ruling Damon said that poor people sometimes pay as much as 25 percent of their income for water. A decade-old United Nations report said that the urban poor in Uganda were paying very nearly that much, about 22 percent of their wages. Damon’s co-founder of Water.org has seen people spending this much in his work in Honduras. More recent hard data appears to be in short supply. But it wouldn’t take much for Damon’s claim to be accurate. Given that poor people pay an inordinate share of whatever money they have for basic needs, and they tend to live in places where water costs more, some people probably do spend as much as Damon said. The facts we have are enough for us to rate this claim Mostly True. See Figure 2 on PolitiFact.com	None	Matt Damon	None	None	None	2017-05-01T18:04:20	2017-04-20	['None']
pomt-08700	Likens Obama's predicament to 1982, saying, "when Reagan just started out, (unemployment was at) exactly the same point. He was two years into his term. The unemployment was well over 10 percent, and it did come out of it."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/sep/07/mary-jordan/how-similar-were-recessions-under-ronald-reagan-ba/	As Democrats grapple with the stagnant economy and President Barack Obama's crumbling approval ratings, expect to hear this comparison a lot: Barack Obama in 2010 = Ronald Reagan in 1982. On the surface, the comparison is compelling. Reagan and Obama succeeded unpopular incumbents and rode a wave of goodwill into office. During their first two years, both presidents faced brutal recessions, and their approval ratings took big hits. Reagan's Republican Party ended up losing 26 House seats in the 1982 midterm elections (increasing the Democrats' majority). Yet only two years later, after the economy had regained its footing, Reagan won a landslide re-election victory. Naturally, Obama partisans hope the same will happen in 2012. So when we heard Mary Jordan, a longtime foreign correspondent with the Washington Post, use this analogy during the roundtable segment of ABC's This Week with Christiane Amanpour, we decided it was time for a fact-check. Jordan said, "And remember, folks, that 1982, when Reagan just started out, it was exactly the same point. He was two years into his term. The unemployment was well over 10 percent, and it did come out of it." We can't yet say how Democrats will fare in November compared with how Republicans did in 1982 and in this item we're only examining unemployment. So we turned to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the federal agency that calculates the unemployment rate. In August 1982, two months before the midterm elections, the unemployment rate stood at 9.8 percent. In August 2010, it was 9.6 percent. So the numbers are remarkably similar. Even the comparative rise during each president's term was similar. The unemployment rate rose 2.5 points between Reagan's election and the last unemployment survey before the midterm election, compared with 3 points for Obama. Case closed? Not really. For one thing, in 1982, the unemployment rate only rose to "well over 10 percent," to use Jordan's words, in October 1982, when it hit 10.4 percent. However, this number was released after Election Day, meaning that it could not have been a factor on voters' minds. It peaked at 10.8 percent in November and December 1982. So while Jordan's number is not far off, it does modestly exaggerate how high voters knew unemployment to be as they prepared to vote. Here's another difference -- the average unemployed worker this year has been jobless much longer than in 1982. In August 1982, the median length of unemployment was 8.7 weeks. In August 2010, it was 19.9 weeks -- more than twice as long. And that's not a blip. For nearly a year, the median duration of unemployment has ranged between 19 and 25.5 weeks. So Jordan is right that there are some similarities between the recessions of 1982 and 2010. But she glosses over the fact that unemployment didn't go "well over 10 percent" in 1982 until after the election, and her use of the overall unemployment rate overlooks an important factor -- that workers this year are likely to have been without jobs much longer. On balance, we rate Jordan's comment Mostly True.	None	Mary Jordan	None	None	None	2010-09-07T15:47:23	2010-09-05	['Ronald_Reagan', 'Barack_Obama']
pomt-09040	"Powerful Houston Democrats Sylvia Garcia (Democrat county commissioner in Harris County) and Elyse Lanie(r) (wife of the former liberal Democrat mayor Bob Lanier) sponsored a Democrat fundraiser for Speaker (Joe) Straus with numerous Democrat officials and high-ranking union officials."	mostly false	/texas/statements/2010/jul/05/david-barton/david-barton-says-houston-democrats-teamed-raise-m/	Writing delegates to the Texas GOP’s state convention, Aledo activist David Barton depicted House Speaker Joe Straus of San Antonio as out of line in his bipartisanship. Barton, a former party vice chairman, levels nearly 20 charges in his letter, including: "Powerful Houston Democrats Sylvia Garcia (Democrat county commissioner in Harris County) and Elyse Lanier (wife of the former liberal Democrat mayor Bob Lanier) sponsored a Democrat fundraiser for Speaker Straus with numerous Democrat officials and high-ranking union officials." Democrats passing the hat for the Republican speaker? We wanted details. Barton subsequently told us in an e-mail: "I knew several of the key Democrats who put it together (including the head of the union based in Houston who was a principal in the event) and I also heard about it from influential business leaders who were invited to the event by Garcia and Lanier." He said guests were summoned by phone or e-mail. Straus’s spokeswoman, Tracy Young, confirmed that Straus raised money for his campaign at a May 4, 2010 party held at the Laniers’ Houston home. Young said, though, the event was hosted by Harris County’s entire House delegation—not just Democrats. Also, she said, Garcia, the county commissioner, did not attend. We reached Garcia, who said she was invited to the party, but couldn’t attend -- nor did she call or e-mail anyone to invite them. Barton’s suggestion that she did so, Garcia said, "is just not true." Asked if she’s a Straus supporter, Garcia replied: "Not really ... The only campaign I am worried about is the Sylvia Garcia re-election campaign." By e-mail, Young forwarded a document inviting recipients to the "Bayou Tribute to Speaker Joe Straus." Under "Honorary Host Committee" it lists 29 Houston-area House members, 17 Republicans and 12 Democrats. Young also shared a document titled "Host Committee" listing more than 30 sponsors of the event including Bob Perry and tort-reform advocate Dick Weekley, Houston homebuilders and major GOP donors; super-lobbyist Mike Toomey of Austin; beer distributor and donor John Nau of Houston and political action committees for law firms, pilots and oil and energy-related firms. The listed sponsors include a PAC for the United Transportation Union. The Laniers are among eight identified underwriters of the party. While mayor of Houston, Bob Lanier was viewed as a Democrat, though the office is filled via non-partisan elections. The May event at the Lanier’s home, Young said, "wasn't a Democrat(ic) fundraiser - it was a bipartisan fundraiser." How does all this add up? Without a subpoena, we can’t determine whether Garcia invited others to the fundraiser, though it appears she did not attend. The rest of Barton’s statement is notable for what it leaves out. For instance, it’s fair to say the Laniers sponsored the party. But so did more than two dozen other backers, including GOP benefactors. While "numerous" Democratic officials were listed as honorary hosts, so were many Republican officeholders. As for "high-ranking union officials," we identified one union’s role. On the other side of the political spectrum Barton did not mention hosts such as Anadarko Petroleum PAC. That committee’s parent company is a partner BP oil well that blew in the Gulf of Mexico. It’s also the biggest single corporate donor to Rep. Joe Barton, R-Texas, according to the Center for Responsive Politics. We weren’t given a list of guests so we could not assess their partisan affiliations. At the least, the Straus event does not appear to have been planned as the Democratic fundraiser Barton portrays. To the contrary, it may have underscored a reality of Texas politics: It behooves players of all stripes to make merry with the speaker. We rate Barton’s sally Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.

pomt-07229	Wisconsin’s technical college graduates "have a higher employment rate and starting salaries" than four-year college graduates nationwide.	mostly false	/wisconsin/statements/2011/jun/02/michael-rosen/union-leader-says-wisconsins-technical-college-gra/	As commencement ceremonies were held throughout Wisconsin in May 2011, an economics instructor delivered what might be startling news to graduates of four-year colleges: "Wisconsin’s tech college grads have a higher employment rate and starting salaries than four-year grads." So read the headline on a May 19, 2011, blog posting from Michael Rosen, who teaches economics at Milwaukee Area Technical College. He is also president of the union that represents MATC teachers and other employees. It might not be surprising if more technical college graduates than four-year graduates get jobs soon after finishing school. But they get paid more, too? Rosen’s blog post, essentially a news and opinion column, appeared on WisOpinion, a website run by WisPolitics.com, and was distributed to subscribers of the weekly WisOpinion e-newsletter. It was also picked up by other sites. To back his statements, Rosen cited figures from two sources: The Wisconsin Technical College System’s 2010 Graduate Follow-up Report from April 2011. It reported results of a survey of 2010 graduates of Wisconsin’s 16 technical colleges. The 17,498 graduates surveyed by the various colleges, through mail and other ways, represented 68 percent of the graduates that year. A New York Times story about a May 2011 Rutgers University study. Rutgers surveyed online a nationally representative sample of 571 U.S. residents who graduated from a four-year college between 2006 and 2010. A note before we proceed: Although 68 percent of the tech college grads responded to the survey, they are not a scientific sample of all grads, which could skew the results. For example, unemployed grads would be undercounted if they were less likely to respond to the survey. In contrast, Rutgers said it used a nationally representative sample of people ages 22 to 29 and that its survey has a margin of error of plus or minus 4.5 percentage points. Now, let’s grade both of Rosen’s claims. Employment rate Rosen claimed that Wisconsin technical college graduates have a higher employment rate than four-year college graduates nationally. The Wisconsin technical colleges survey found that 88 percent of the grads who responded to the survey and who were in the labor force (as opposed to getting more schooling, for example) were employed within six months of finishing school. However, the survey did not try to determine which of those were employed full time and which were employed part time, said Julie Tyznik, performance measurement coordinator for the state tech college system. Of those who were employed, 71 percent said they were in a job related to the training they received. The Rutgers national survey of four-year college graduates found that only 56 percent of the 2010 graduates had gotten a full-time job within about 10 or 11 months of graduation. (Like some of the tech college grads, some four-year grads went on to further schooling or didn’t enter the labor force for some other reason.) Of those who did get jobs, 70 percent worked in a field related to their studies. So, the 88 percent employment figure for the tech college grads is higher than the 56 percent figure for the four-year grads -- but there are some apples and oranges involved in this comparison. Tech college grads were considered employed even if they worked only part time, while the four-year grad survey measured only full-time employment among 2010 grads. More detail is available in the Rutgers study if all of the 2006 through 2010 grads are considered. In the full sample, 53 percent were employed full time, 12 percent part time, 3 percent were self-employed and 2 percent were in the military. That’s a total of 70 percent employed. Of the rest, 21 percent were in graduate school and 9 percent were unemployed. Starting salary Rosen claimed Wisconsin technical college graduates earn a higher starting salary than four-year college graduates nationally. He said the median starting salary was $31,198 for Wisconsin technical college graduates and $27,000 for four-year graduates nationally. (The median is the mid-point -- half of the salaries are below and half are above the mid-point.) But on this claim, as academics like to say, more research is needed. The $31,198 starting salary for 2010 Wisconsin tech college graduates applies only to those graduates who were employed full-time in occupations related to their training. In other words, the picture is skewed because the dollar amount doesn’t take into account the tech grads who weren’t working in their chosen fields or those working part time. The Rutgers study found the median starting salary for all 2010 four-year grads surveyed was $27,000, the comparison Rosen cited. But when the comparison was shifted to only those working in fields related to their studies, the salary was $35,000 for the four-year graduates who got their degrees between 2006 and 2010 -- nearly $4,000 more than the starting salary for the tech college grads. (Rutgers professor Cliff Zukin, one of the authors of the Rutgers study, told us the survey sample was too small to generate a median starting salary for only the 2010 four-year graduates.) Rosen agreed he was wrong on his second claim about starting pay. He argued that his larger point -- that Wisconsin technical grads do better coming out of school than four-year grads nationally -- is accurate because, in his view, more of them find work. OK, let’s don those caps and gowns; we’re about to graduate from this little course. Rosen said Wisconsin’s technical college graduates have a higher employment rate and starting salaries than four-year college graduates nationally. On the first claim, a direct comparison of 2010 grads can’t be made because a complete breakdown wasn’t available, but more 2010 tech college grads found work than the 2006 through 2010 four-year grads. On the second claim, Rosen admitted he was wrong. We would also note that the tech college data comes from an unscientific survey and the four-year grads data was from a scientific survey. We don’t know how Rosen would score this all out on an economics quiz, but on our scale it rates a Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.	None	Michael Rosen	None	None	None	2011-06-02T09:00:00	2011-05-19	['None']
pomt-01469	David Perdue "proposes rolling back the clock on women’s health care."	half-true	/georgia/statements/2014/oct/01/georgians-together/pac-ad-misleading-/	As election day draws closer and the push for votes intensifies, the airwaves are being flooded with political attack ads. One new ad for Michelle Nunn, the Democratic nominee for U.S. Senate, makes a claim about her Republican opponent, businessman David Perdue, that piqued our interest. Perdue "proposes rolling back the clock on women’s health care," the ad states. The Nunn camp has already been trying to turn female voters against Perdue with ads about a lawsuit filed during his tenure as CEO of discounter Dollar General. The lawsuit accused Dollar General of paying male managers more than female managers for the same work. The new ad from super PAC Georgians Together opens talking about the wage discrimination lawsuit, which was settled by Dollar General’s parent company for $18.75 million several years after Perdue left the company. The ad closes with these lines: "David Perdue -- Georgia women just can’t trust him. Michelle Nunn -- Georgia women can always trust her." For our fact check, we reached out to Keith Mason, a longtime Democratic operative and treasurer of Georgians Together, the super PAC that was launched to support Nunn’s campaign and that is funding the new ad. We asked for evidence to support the ad claim that Perdue proposes rolling back the clock on women’s health care. "Perdue supports outright repeal of ACA [the Affordable Care Act]," Mason said in an email. Perdue has had on his campaign website that he wants to repeal and replace the ACA, also known as Obamacare, Mason said. He also pointed us to a news report that Perdue and four of his primary opponents publicly backed a plan by U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, to strip funding for the ACA as part any government spending bill, an effort that led to a government shutdown and ultimately did not succeed. How does that translate to women’s health? Mason forwarded us a link to a Chicago Tribune story headlined: "Numerous Affordable Care Act Provisions Specifically Benefit Women." The article said most plans under the ACA include preventive care, and, for women, that means an annual "well-woman visit," breast-feeding support, contraceptives, contraceptive counseling, annual mammograms and cervical cancer screenings. William S. Cluster, director of the Center for Health Services Research at Georgia State University, said there’s an argument for stating that women of childbearing years would be more adversely impacted by repeal of the ACA. Women under 45 have more health care needs than men in the same age group, he said. Prior to the implementation of the ACA, premiums in the individual market were higher for women than for men and the coverage often excluded preventative care -- mammograms for example -- and maternity care, Custer said. "The Affordable Care Act prohibits insurers from charging different premiums to men and women. It also requires plans to offer maternity care and preventive health (coverage)." he said. ‘So while a lot of Georgians would lose coverage, or face higher costs with the repeal of the ACA, women may feel that loss more than men." Perdue spokesman Derrick Dickey said the candidate’s position has been clear. "David does support the outright repeal of Obamacare," Dickey said. Perdue would like to see it replaced with "a consumer-driven" alternative, such as U.S. Rep. Tom Price’s Empowering Patients First Act, the spokesman said. But the ad claim by the Nunn camp is "misleading," Dickey said. "If the Nunn campaign thinks repealing Obamacare is ‘rolling back the clock on women’s health care,’ they should just say that," he said. "However, they can’t because Obamacare is incredibly unpopular." Polls indicate Dickey’s right on the public’s sentiment. In a poll taken in August and September, the Kaiser Family Foundation found that public opinion of the Affordable Care Act remains more negative than positive. Among registered voters, 49 percent view the law unfavorably, 35 percent favorably. Opinion tilts even more negatively among likely voters, 51 percent vs. 35 percent, the poll found. Republicans in Congress have repeatedly maneuvered over the past four years to try to repeal or defund the ACA, which was signed into law on March 23, 2010 and upheld by the U.S. Supreme Court on June 28, 2012. Some political analysts link the rise of the conservative Tea Party movement and the Republican takeover of the U.S. House in the 2010 midterm elections to the public furor over the law’s debate and enactment. Kerwin Swint, head of the political science department at Kennesaw State University, said he "completely understands" the strategy behind the Georgians Together ad claim. "The Nunn camp and their supporters want to take full advantage of the gender gap by driving up Perdue's negatives among female voters," Swint said. "But if their only evidence for ‘rolling back the clock on women's health care’ is Perdue's support for repealing the ACA, that's pretty flimsy." The latest reports show about 316,00 Georgians have selected marketplace plans, 57 percent females and 43 percent males Larry Sabato, director of the Center for Politics at the University of Virginia, said these type of ads have become standard in Democratic campaigns this year. If its not ACA repeal, its GOP backing of a personhood amendment or backing of stricter controls on abortion, Sabato said. "Democrats have to do everything possible to expand the gender gap in their direction. Control of the Senate is riding on whether women heavily support candidates such as Nunn," he said. "Republicans will carry men, as usual, and Democrats will win women, but the margins matter." Our Ruling. The super PAC, Georgians Together, makes a claim that contains some truth. Some women could be hurt by repeal or replacement of the Affordable Care Act, or Obamacare, which has expanded some benefits for some women. But the ad never mentions Obamacare. That’s a major omission. Voters also need to know what Perdue is proposing -- repeal and replacement of Obamacare -- others have tried to do and failed. And you could argue that almost any group helped by Obamacare could be hurt with its repeal. There is a lot of missing context in this attack ad. We rate it Half True.

pomt-09268	Members of Congress "have not reduced their salaries ... since the Great Depression," meaning they've gone "eight decades without a pay cut."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/apr/30/ann-kirkpatrick/members-congress-havent-had-pay-cut-great-depressi/	Given widespread voter frustration with Congress and stagnation in private-sector pay, it's no surprise that Rep. Ann Kirkpatrick, D-Ariz., has introduced a bill to cut the pay for members of Congress by 5 percent. Kirkpatrick touted her bill in a House floor speech on April 28, 2010, saying that it was time for lawmakers to face a pay cut. "When millions of Americans are tightening their belts," she said, "folks have the right to expect their elected officials to do the same. ... Members have not reduced their salaries for 77 years, since the Great Depression. I do not know anyone back in Arizona who has gone eight decades without a pay cut. Senators and representatives should be no different." We thought it would be worth checking her comment that lawmakers "have not reduced their salaries" since 1933, which she says resulted in "eight decades without a pay cut." Kirkpatrick chose her year wisely: In the midst of the Great Depression, Congress voted to reduce its salaries twice. In 1932, lawmakers cut their pay from $10,000 to $9,000. A year later, they cut salaries from $9,000 to $8,500. Kirkpatrick is correct that since 1933, congressional salary rates have only climbed upward. Today, salaries for representatives and senators are $174,000 a year. (Click here for a table of congressional salaries from 1789 to today.) Case closed? Not so fast. The situation changes when you account for inflation. We used the Bureau of Labor Statistics inflation calculator to determine the inflation-adjusted salaries at some of the key points for Congress during the past 77 years. Overall, the number has indeed gone up from the adjusted 1933 rate of $142,297 (in 2010 dollars) to $174,000 per year today. But we found that there have been periods when lawmakers' pay was stagnant, and once inflation is factored in, that means they effectively took pay cuts. For instance, just before salaries were raised in 1965, the congressional pay rate that had been in force since 1955 -- $22,500 -- had shrunk in value to $19,452, a 14 percent decline in purchasing power. And just before salaries were raised in 1975, the congressional pay rate that had been in force since 1969 -- $42,500 -- had shriveled in value to $31,638 in 1969 dollars, a whopping 26 percent decline in purchasing power. "There were a number of years since 1969 in which Congress specifically voted to hold its nominal salary unchanged even though price levels were rising and an automatic pay formula would have bumped up its pay, along with the pay of other senior officers of the U.S. government," said Gary Burtless, an economist with the liberal Brookings Institution who has testified before a House committee on lawmakers' salaries. There's also evidence that, once inflation is factored in, lawmakers are less well-compensated today than they once were. In 1955, lawmakers were paid the equivalent of $182,713 in 2010 dollars, an amount 5 percent higher than today's actual level. In 1965, they were paid the 2010 equivalent of $207,267, or 19 percent higher than today's actual level. Factoring inflation into the equation doesn't disprove Kirkpatrick's statement that members of Congress "have not reduced their salaries for 77 years." But it does make it hard for her to argue that lawmakers have gone "eight decades without a pay cut." In reality, congressional salaries have zig-zagged quite a bit over the years, sometimes exceeding today's level of purchasing power and sometimes falling short. We're not shedding tears for the buying power of people who earn more than $170,000 a year. But the erratic way that Congress has raised its salaries means that the story is more complicated than Kirkpatrick portrays it. We rate her statement Half True.

pomt-08458	Loranne "Ausley's a financial train wreck for taxpayers -- pushing gas taxes, property taxes, taxes on seniors."	false	/florida/statements/2010/oct/14/jeff-atwater/loranne-ausleys-tax-record-center-stage-state-cfo-/	In her TV ad, Democratic chief financial officer candidate Loranne Ausley threw a series of three claims against her Republican opponent Jeff Atwater. We said False. Now Atwater is firing back with a trio of claims against Ausley in an ad of his own. The ad is called "Two Liberals," and liberally tries to tie Ausley to U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. Yes, they are both Democrats and women. "This Washington liberal is raising taxes and wrecking our economy. Now, Pelosi has Loranne Ausley, the Tallahassee politician who wants total control ... of our money," a narrator says. "Watch out, because Ausley's a financial train wreck for taxpayers -- pushing gas taxes, property taxes, taxes on seniors. "Pelosi and Ausley -- too liberal too costly." Like Ausley's ad attacking Atwater, we're fact-checking the whole of the three specific claims -- that Ausley, a former member of the Florida House, pushed gas taxes, property taxes and taxes as seniors. Our analysis reveals a political art -- clever wording. Gas taxes Ausley didn't push for increased gas taxes as a member of the state House. Instead, she voted against a one-month, eight-cent reduction of the gas tax back in 2004. Here are the details. The bill, HB 237, reduced the state gas tax from 14.3 cents to 6.3 cents in August 2004, and also created a back-to-school sales tax holiday for school items $50 or less. The proposal passed with broad bipartisan support: 107-8 in the House and 34-4 in the Senate. Ausley was one of the eight no votes in the House. Atwater, a member of the state Senate, voted yes. But that didn't mean the measure was completely popular. Newspaper editorials argued the loss in state revenue for temporarily lowering the gas tax -- about $60 million -- wasn't worth the small savings to drivers. The Sarasota Herald-Tribune editorial board calculated that the average driver would save a "whopping" $3.67. "Don't spend it all in one place," they wrote. "Loranne voted to keep the existing tax structure in place, as well as against the entire budget that year because of the lack of funding for important issues like boosting teacher salaries and the critical funding of Florida KidCare," Ausley spokesman Kevin Cate said. It's worth noting that the idea of a gas tax holiday resurfaced in 2008 and was being pushed by Gov. Charlie Crist. Crist asked state Sen. Mike Fasano, R-New Port Richey, to file an amendment to a revenue bill (SB 1838) that would suspend 10 cents of the state's gas tax for a two-week period from July 1-14. But the amendment was never heard in the GOP-controlled Senate and Atwater, as a senator, didn't have to take a vote on the measure. Neither did Ausley, who was in the House. Property taxes Ausley didn't push for increased property taxes as a member of the state House. Instead, she voted against Republican proposals to cut property taxes. Here are the details. During a special session in June 2007, Ausley voted against sending a proposed constitutional amendment to the ballot asking voters to replace Save Our Homes assessment caps with bigger homestead exemptions. Under the proposal, which passed without a Democratic vote, the first $200,000 of value would get a 75 percent exemption, then property values between $300,000 and $500,000 would get an additional 15 percent exemption. Homes valued at $500,000 and up would get a maximum exemption of $195,000. Democrats argued that the tax cuts could harm funding for education and for police and fire protection. Ausley did vote to schedule the special election for the proposal on Jan. 29, 2008. She also voted for a proposal to roll back the tax bases for cities, counties and special taxing districts. Ultimately, the Republican-led constitutional proposal was tossed off the ballot by a judge who ruled the amendment was confusing. So legislators returned to deal with the constitutional proposal that October. Ausley was just one of two House members to vote against a House plan to raise the homestead exemption, create a cap on assessment increases for non-homesteaded property, provide additional exemptions for low-income seniors, and allow people to move and keep some of their homestead tax cap. According to the Tallahassee Democrat, Ausley complained that the "cuts would devastate poor and rural counties." That proposal never became law or was put to voters either. Instead, the final tax reform product in 2007 -- what became known as Amendment 1 on January 2008 ballots -- passed the House 97-18 and the Senate 35-4. Ausley again voted against the measure. Amendment 1 passed with 64 percent of the vote. Taxes on seniors Ausley didn't push for increased taxes on seniors. Instead, she opposed cutting and eliminating the state's intangible tax. This is ground PolitiFact Florida already has covered in a claim against Ausley from the Republican Party of Florida. Here are the details. The intangible tax, which was repealed by the Legislature in 2006, was a state tax paid on the value of investments such as stocks, bonds, mutual funds, money market funds and unsecured notes. Savings accounts, pension funds, certificates of deposit and 401(k)s were not subject to the tax. The tax was paid mostly by middle- and upper-income Floridians who had those types of investments. On several occasions, Ausley voted against repealing, or making cuts to the intangible tax. In 2001, she did vote for a more modest cut than Republicans were proposing. Democrats argued that the benefit of the cut was largely to the wealthy and the loss of state revenue would hurt programs for the poor. The tax, of course, didn't apply only to seniors. It applied to anyone who had those types of investments. And it didn't apply to things that would be traditionally considered retirement funds like a 401(k) or a pension. Summary This fact check centers on Atwater's claim that "Ausley's a financial train wreck for taxpayers -- pushing gas taxes, property taxes, taxes on seniors." First, we want to mention that Atwater's ad also claims that Ausley "wants total control of our money." That's incendiary and far-reaching rhetoric that cannot be supported by examining Ausley's statements or voting history. You should ignore the line. What is true, though, is that Ausley voted against measures to create a gas tax holiday for one month in 2004, voted against sweeping property tax cuts in 2007 and voted against eliminating a state tax on investments. That makes the "taxes on seniors" immediately deceptive because the intangible tax isn't a tax on seniors specifically. Something else that has us scratching our heads more, though. Atwater says Ausley was "pushing" these taxes. But was she? Time to take out the dictionary. There are several definitions of the word push, but in this context we find a couple that make sense - "To cause to increase," and "To press forward energetically against opposition." Ausley didn't vote to cause those taxes to increase, nor did she press forward energetically with the taxes. She voted against cutting them. We find this claim False.

pomt-02820	"Macy's sent a letter to Rick Perry urging him to veto" equal pay bill.	true	/texas/statements/2013/nov/25/senfronia-thompson/macys-other-retailers-asked-rick-perry-veto-equal-/	A reader forwarded an email to us in which state Rep. Senfronia Thompson urged a boycott of Macy’s department stores on the day after Thanksgiving 2013. "The fact that Macy's doesn't support equal pay for women should stop you from shopping there on Black Friday," the Houston Democrat wrote, saying that her equal-pay proposal cleared the Legislature earlier this year, but "then Macy's sent a letter to Rick Perry urging him to veto the law, which he ultimately did." Thompson’s House Bill 950 was among 24 bills Perry vetoed June 14, 2013. It would have created state law similar to 2009’s federal Lilly Ledbetter Act, which gave plaintiffs more time to sue over pay discrimination in federal courts. An Aug. 6, 2013, news story in the Houston Chronicle reported that Texas Retailers Association members including Macy’s and Kroger’s had written Perry in May asking him to kill the legislation because, they said, it would lead to open-ended litigation and duplicate federal law. Thompson spokeswoman Milda Mora told us by phone that the representative learned of the letters from the Houston Chronicle reporter in August and checked with the governor’s office, which provided her with copies that Mora emailed to us. One written on Macy’s letterhead (click here or scroll down to view it) concluded, "The federal requirements under Lilly Ledbetter are unnecessary and would be harmful to Texas employers. We urge you to veto this legislation." Macy’s spokeswoman Bethany Charlton confirmed that her company sent the May 31, 2013, letter, which was signed by a company vice president. By email, Charlton said the company "absolutely supports equal pay for equal work among men and women" but believes existing laws "provide strong remedies" for discrimination. Perry’s logic was similar: "House Bill 950 duplicates federal law, which already allows employees who feel they have been discriminated against through compensation to file a claim with the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission," said his June 14, 2013, veto statement. Progress Texas, the pro-Democratic organization that distributed Thompson’s email and is organizing the boycott, disputes Perry’s statement that the bill would have duplicated federal law, saying that the Ledbetter protections need to be codified in state law for them to apply to cases in state courts. The group’s executive director, Ed Espinoza, told us by email that his group launched a boycott of Macy’s and other retailers when the news broke in August. An Aug. 7, 2013, Chronicle news blog post said Thompson took part in that boycott also, canceling a planned appearance at a Macy’s store to mark the state’s annual sales-tax holiday. Mora said that Thompson, who was quoted in an Aug. 9, 2013 Texas Public Radio news story as saying she had previously been a "card-packing member of Macy’s," but had not shopped there since the letters became public. Our ruling Thompson said "Macy's sent a letter to Rick Perry urging him to veto" her equal pay measure. As the Houston newspaper reported, Macy’s wrote the governor May 31, 2013, saying "We urge you to veto this legislation." The claim is True.

pomt-00743	Says Hillary Clinton took "money from kings of Saudi Arabia and Morocco and Oman and Yemen."	half-true	/wisconsin/statements/2015/apr/20/reince-priebus/hillary-clinton-took-money-kings-four-countries-go/	For probably as long as Democrats anticipated Hillary Clinton announcing for president, Republicans anticipated attacking her. On April 12, 2015, the day Clinton’s run became official, Republican National Committee chairman Reince Priebus disparaged her on CBS' "Face the Nation." The former chairman of the Wisconsin GOP appeared on the program after U.S. Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., who declared for president several days before Clinton did. Paul told host Bob Schieffer that Clinton will have a problem with women voters because "she has taken money from countries that abuse the rights of women," and he referred to Saudi Arabia. Schieffer later noted that Saudi Arabia had given money to Clinton’s foundation, and then while interviewing Priebus, said Clinton couldn’t use that money personally. Schieffer added: "But it also occurs to me, a lot of your candidates and the Democrats as well, are going to be taking campaign contributions that we are never going to know where they come from -- but now you can give these unbelievable amounts of money without any accounting of where the money comes from." Priebus replied with a claim about kings and cash: "But the difference is, all those other entities -- Super PACs, parties, individual candidates -- they can't take money from kings of Saudi Arabia and Morocco and Oman and Yemen, and that's what Hillary Clinton did. And so she's going to have to account for this money." Priebus' statement goes beyond foreign government contributions to the Clinton Foundation, leaving the impression Clinton herself may have benefitted from money donated by the four countries -- including Yemen, which is the home of one of al-Qaida’s most active branches, and where the United States has conducted airstrikes since 2009. Let's sort it all out. Clinton Foundation Not only Republicans are raising questions about whether the Clinton Foundation is taking millions of dollars a year from governments and other donors that want political influence. The Wall Street Journal, the Washington Post, Politico and CBS News have run stories about the questions, with a Journal analysis noting that the number of governments contributing to the foundation in 2014 appeared to have doubled from the previous year. Responding to Priebus’ claim, the foundation emailed us a statement saying: "Like other global charities, the Clinton Foundation receives support from individuals, organizations and governments from all over the world because the foundation's programs improve the lives of millions of people around the globe." The charity, originally named the William J. Clinton Foundation, was launched in 2001 by former President Bill Clinton. Its aim is to partner with government and non-government organizations to tackle issues such as AIDS and poverty. The foundation has received millions of dollars from foreign governments, as PolitiFact National found in February 2015 when it rated that claim by a conservative group as True. When Hillary Clinton became secretary of state in 2009, under President Barack Obama, the foundation agreed to disclose its donors at the request of the White House. When she left the Cabinet post, in February 2013, the foundation became the Bill, Hillary & Chelsea Clinton Foundation, with Hillary Clinton taking an active role in fundraising. Clinton resigned from the foundation’s board just before announcing her candidacy. And a few days later, the foundation announced it would modify its policies while she is a candidate for president, limiting which governments can give directly to the foundation. An important note: Candidates for office are prohibited by law from accepting campaign contributions from foreign governments, but foundations have no such restriction. Here’s what we know about the four countries cited by Priebus: Saudi Arabia The kingdom gave between $10 million and $25 million to the Clinton Foundation between the time the foundation was created through 2014, and some portion of the funds was contributed in 2014, according to the foundation’s searchable database. (The database only reports ranges of the total amounts given and does not provide a breakdown by year, except that it notes which donors made a contribution in 2014.) According to a February 2015 news article by the Washington Post, Saudi Arabia was among some foreign governments that had been supporting the foundation before Clinton was appointed secretary of state, did not give while she was in office and then resumed giving. Saudi Arabia has long been regarded by the United States as a friend and a "strong partner in regional security and counterterrorism efforts," according to the State Department. Oman The Sultanate of Oman gave the foundation between $1 million and $5 million through 2014, including contributions given in 2014, according to the foundation database. The U.S. and Oman have been parties to a military cooperation agreement since 1980. Oman "plays an important role in helping the United States realize its regional stability goals" in the Middle East, the State Department says. Morocco Four days before Clinton announced her run, Politico reported that the foundation was accepting at least $1 million from a Moroccan government-owned company to hold a high-profile conference in May 2015 in Marrakech with the king of Morocco. The article noted that in 2011, Clinton’s State Department had accused the Moroccan government of "arbitrary arrests and corruption in all branches of government," but that when she announced the conference in September 2014, she praised Morocco as "a vital hub for economic and cultural exchange." The U.S. regards Morocco as a "strong partner in counterterrorism efforts," according to the State Department. Yemen Neither the Post nor the Politico articles, which were cited to us by Priebus’ office, reported any donations to the foundation from Yemen. And a spokesman for the foundation told us the country has never been a donor. Yemen borders Saudi Arabia and Oman, but unlike those countries and Morocco, is not a monarchy. American drones have been conducting strikes in Yemen since 2009. On April 14, 2015, the al-Qaida terrorist group announced that one of its top spokesmen for its branch in Yemen had been killed the previous day by an American drone strike. Our rating Priebus said Clinton took "money from kings of Saudi Arabia and Morocco and Oman and Yemen." The monarchies of Saudi Arabia, Morocco and Oman have contributed to the Clinton Foundation, but Yemen, which does not have a king, has not. And although Priebus’ claim was made during a discussion of the foundation as well as contributions to political candidates, his phrasing could have left the impression that Clinton herself, rather than the foundation, received the money. For a statement that is partially accurate, our rating is Half True. To comment on this article, go to the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel's web page.

pomt-03277	Says by rejecting an expansion of Medicaid under the new law, Georgia was depriving 25,000 veterans of health care coverage.	true	/georgia/statements/2013/aug/06/michelle-nunn/senate-candidate-pushes-war-vets-medicaid-plan/	Democrat Michelle Nunn recently jumped into Georgia’s race for the U.S. Senate and talked about a troubling issue: military veterans without health insurance. Nunn, who is campaigning as a problem-solver and not a partisan politician, responded to a question about the controversial federal health care law, widely called "Obamacare," by saying she supports efforts to suture trouble spots, but not to repeal it. Nunn then added in an exclusive interview with The Atlanta Journal-Constitution’s Political Insider blog that by rejecting an expansion of Medicaid under the new law, Georgia was depriving 25,000 veterans of health care coverage. PolitiFact Georgia wondered about the accuracy of Nunn’s claim. Nunn was CEO of the Points of Light Foundation, a nonprofit, nonpartisan volunteer organization inspired by then-President George H.W. Bush. Her father, conservative Democrat Sam Nunn, represented Georgia in the U.S. Senate from 1972 to 1997. Her entry into the race was widely welcomed by Democrats and by Republicans who’ve portrayed Nunn as a liberal who’ll be in lockstep with President Barack Obama. She’s never run for political office. An estimated 650,000 Georgians would be eligible for Medicaid if the state agreed to expand coverage. The health law calls for states to expand coverage to individuals with incomes up to 138 percent of the federal poverty level, or about $26,300 for a family of three. The federal government would cover the entire cost of the expansion for the first three years and at least 90 percent after that. Many Republicans, including Gov. Nathan Deal, do not believe Washington can keep such a commitment considering the federal government’s financial challenges. Critics worry the state could eventually get stuck with the tab. States have the option to participate in the Medicaid expansion. Deal declined. "The state simply can’t afford to expand Medicaid as Obamacare is now structured," Deal spokesman Brian Robinson said. "The majority of our population will bear huge new costs as individuals covering their families and as taxpayers." We read several accounts that Georgia has one of the largest populations of veterans in the nation. Georgia’s Department of Veterans Services estimates that there are 776,000 veterans in the state. Not all veterans are eligible for medical benefits through the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, thus some of them are uninsured, said Tim Sweeney, director of health policy for the left-leaning Georgia Budget and Policy Institute, which has done research on the subject. Priority for benefits goes to veterans injured in combat, those receiving pension benefits and those determined to be disabled. Nunn’s deputy campaign manager, Zac Petkanas, said the candidate’s claim was based on two reports released earlier this year. One was a nationwide study of uninsured veterans compiled by the Washington-based Urban Institute. The institute describes itself as a nonpartisan research center, but its leadership includes several former Clinton administration officials. The second report was an examination of the potential impact of Medicaid expansion on veterans by the Georgia Budget and Policy Institute. The Urban Institute report said it used U.S. Census Bureau data to come up with its estimate. The institute found there are about 1.3 million uninsured veterans younger than 65. The estimate is in line with several news reports on the topic in recent years. The institute found 535,000 of those uninsured veterans were eligible for Medicaid under the income guidelines set by the federal government. "We used data from the American Community Survey, which asks about veteran status, health insurance status, and various sources of income; the income measure we used approximates the way income will be counted under the Affordable Care Act," said Jennifer Haley, a co-author of the report. The report found that 43 percent of all poor, uninsured veterans reside in seven states, and Georgia is one of them. About 56,000 Georgia veterans were uninsured, the report found. Of that number, 24,900 of them fell within the Medicaid eligibility guidelines, the Urban Institute found. The Atlanta Journal-Constitution reported about the study in May. The Georgia Budget and Policy Institute also estimated 25,000 Georgia veterans would be eligible for Medicaid under the rules in a report it released in May. Sweeney said its report was primarily based on prior Urban Institute research. "They’re as robust and credible as it gets when it comes to research like this," Sweeney said. Slightly more than 6 percent of veterans nationwide lack health insurance, according to a 2011 profile of U.S. veterans done by the Department of Veterans Affairs. If the numbers are similar for Georgia veterans, that amounts to about 50,000 of them without insurance, which is close to what the Urban Institute found. The profile does not specify how many of them would be eligible for Medicaid. The U.S. Census Bureau does not keep its own data on veterans without health insurance. A Census Bureau official suggested we contact the Urban Institute for such information, noting it did a study on the topic and may be a good resource. State officials said they did not have research on how many veterans could be added to Georgia’s Medicaid rolls. "The state can’t cherry-pick which groups of people would be eligible for expanded coverage under Medicaid. Nunn is making a political argument, not a policy argument, so it’s not something we’d have numbers on," Robinson said. To sum up, Nunn claimed 25,000 military veterans could be added to Georgia’s Medicaid rolls if the state would sign up for the federal government’s plan under the Affordable Care Act, aka Obamacare. The claim was based on research that hasn’t been reviewed for a second opinion and appears on target. We rate this claim True.

"Breaking: Santa Fe killer expresses his love for Obama," said a May 18 headline by The Daily World Update. Facebook flagged this story as part of its efforts to combat false news and misinformation on Facebook's News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) We found no evidence that the suspect loved Obama. The story falsely said that "Dimitrius Pagopogouritz is a liberal whose immigrant parents raised him on welfare in the projects of San Dimas." The story invented a "leaked interview with police" in which the suspect "admitted he was an Obama-loving moonbat who was looking to ‘end gun violence’ by adding another shooting." The first sign that this is made up is that the suspect’s name is wrong; his actual name is Dimitrios Pagourtzis. The story also makes up all sorts of ridiculous details, including that suspect’s father is serving a life sentence for stealing "6,000 pounds of tainted turkey bacon." Law enforcement has not released information about a motive for the mass shooting that left 10 people dead. The mother of one victim said that her daughter had recently turned down the advances of the boy. The Daily World Update is linked to a frequent purveyor of hoaxes, Christopher Blair, who says he creates fake stories to make money. While Blair identifies The Daily World Update as satire, other blogs often pick up Blair’s stories without the satire asterisk. Fake accounts imitating the suspect on Facebook also depicted him wearing a hat showing support for Hillary Clinton’s 2016 presidential bid, with a background photo displaying a banner espousing anti-fascists, or Antifa, views.

pomt-14986	Says Edward Snowden "could have gotten all of the protections of being a whistleblower."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/oct/14/hillary-clinton/clinton-says-nsa-leaker-snowden-failed-use-whistle/	Edward Snowden’s decision to reveal the existence of massive national security databases of Americans’ email and telephone data remains a flashpoint for debate among Americans. Some people praise Snowden as a hero. To others, Snowden is a traitor. The U.S. government charged Snowden, an employee of a government security contractor, with violating the Espionage Act. He found asylum in Russia but would like to return home. At the first Democratic debate Oct. 13, CNN moderator Anderson Cooper pressed the candidates to offer their view of Snowden. Hillary Clinton said Snowden shouldn’t come home "without facing the music." "He broke the laws of the United States," Clinton said. "He could have been a whistleblower. He could have gotten all of the protections of being a whistleblower. He could have raised all the issues that he has raised. And I think there would have been a positive response to that." That’s not accurate, we found. While American law does shield government whistleblowers, it wouldn't necessarily apply in Snowden's case. The law Snowden was charged with two counts of unauthorized communication under the 1917 Espionage Act. That law makes it a crime punishable by death or imprisonment to share "information relating to the national defense" with anyone who might want to do harm to the United States. Among other details, Snowden showed that under a federal court order, Verizon was providing the National Security Agency with the phone records of nearly all its customers, and on similar terms, giants such as Google and Facebook were turning over user data. He also let the world know that the United States was listening in on the private calls of the leaders of its closest allies. That law has no specific whistleblower protection. What Snowden could have relied on, experts say, is the 1998 Intelligence Community Whistleblower Protection Act. That law includes some protections, but they're not as strong as Clinton lets on. And it's not clear they could have saved Snowden. Under that 1998 law, Snowden could have raised his concerns with the Inspector General’s Office at the NSA or spoken to congressional intelligence committees. (A separate federal law protects whistleblowers more generally, but that only applies to sharing unclassified information, not the secret materials that Snowden had in hand.) Snowden claims that he did raise his concerns with a legal division at the National Security Agency but was rebuffed. The National Security Agency has released a single email from Snowden in which he asked for clarification of the laws that govern the agency. A debate over protection The 1998 law aimed at intelligence community workers specifically includes contractors such as Snowden. Daniel D’Isidoro, a former U.S. Army judge advocate, argued in the Harvard Law School National Security Journal that Snowden did have a legal pathway to voice his concerns. But he also said it was unclear if the issues Snowden raised would have fallen under the guidelines of that law. Briefly, Snowden’s complaints would need to meet the definition of an "urgent concern." That term specifically doesn’t cover policy disagreements. At the time, the NSA could reasonably assert that it was following the law, which would undercut Snowden’s case, D’Isidoro said. Tellingly, Thomas Gimble, the acting inspector general for the Army, said in 2006 House testimony that the Intelligence Community Whistleblower Protection Act was "a misnomer." It "does not provide statutory protection from reprisal for whistleblowing for employees of the intelligence community," Gimble said. An assessment in the Boston University Law Review concluded that the 1998 law "arguably fails to provide any real protection to national security whistleblowers." Others familiar with this legal landscape echoed the view Snowden would have been vulnerable to prosecution if he went public through government channels. The Intelligence Community Whistleblower Protection Act, for instance, does not prohibit agencies from retaliating against employees, said Elizabeth Goitein, co-director of the Brennan Center’s Liberty and National Security Program at New York University School of Law. Goitein said President Barack Obama helped matters slightly when he issued a presidential order preventing retaliation against federal employees. But that order did not explicitly address the rights of contractors such as Snowden. And Goitein added, neither that directive nor the whistleblower law "bars the government from criminally prosecuting whistleblowers." This has played out before. In 2010, NSA staffer Thomas Drake tried to use proper channels to report allegations of improper contracting but wound up the target of an investigation, said Kathleen McClellan, the national security and human rights counsel for the Government Accountability Project, a whistleblower advocacy group. "Drake followed the Intelligence Community Whistleblower law to a ‘T’," McClellan said in January 2014. "He went to the Department of Defense inspector general and both congressional intelligence committees and it did not protect him from retaliation. In fact, it made him the target of an investigation." Federal agents went after Drake in pursuit of a separate matter and charged him with multiple felonies, according to a report from the Committee to Protect Journalists. When it became clear that whatever Drake had shared with the press was either not classified or already in the public domain, the government’s felony case collapsed. A federal judge said it was "unconscionable" that Drake and his family had endured "four years of hell." We reached out to the Clinton campaign and did not hear back. Our ruling Clinton said that Edward Snowden could have gotten all the protections of being a whistleblower." A key 1998 law focused on intelligence community workers does lay out a pathway Snowden could have followed. However, there is at least a significant legal debate over whether the issues Snowden wanted to raise would fall under that law. Additionally, legal experts including an Army inspector general have said that the 1998 law does not protect whistleblowers from reprisals. The protections that Clinton referenced do not seem to be as strong as she suggested, and most of the expert opinion suggests they would not apply to Snowden. We rate this claim Mostly False.

pomt-03030	Says Democratic gubernatorial candidate Mary Burke "has proven on the Madison Board of Education" that she supports raising taxes and spending.	half-true	/wisconsin/statements/2013/oct/10/republican-party-wisconsin/gop-says-mary-burke-candidate-governor-has-tax-and/	The quiet but steady buildup to Democrat Mary Burke’s campaign for governor gave the Wisconsin Republican Party time to pounce. On Oct. 7, 2013, the day Burke announced her candidacy by video, the state GOP launched MaryBurke.com, a site that denigrates the former Trek Bicycle Corp. executive and state commerce secretary as a liberal millionaire and a killer of jobs. The party also uses the site to attack Burke’s tenure on the Madison School Board, declaring: "Mary Burke is simply more of the same – as she has proven on the Madison Board of Education. (She) voted to increase taxes by the maximum amount under state law by voting to approve the 2012-’13 Madison (Metropolitan) School District final budget on Oct. 29, 2012. Rather than work to make government more efficient, she voted to raise taxes and increase spending. She would do the same as governor – and we’ve come too far to go backward now." We can’t predict, of course, what Burke would do if she is elected governor in November 2014. But we can check her taxing and spending record -- scant, though it may be -- since she was elected to the Madison School Board in April 2012. Three votes Burke has taken part in three school board votes on two budgets for the Madison Metropolitan School District. In Madison, property taxes make up about 60 percent of the school district’s funding. The school board has relatively little control over the rest of its revenue, which comes from the state, the federal government and local sources such as student fees. (Statewide, as of 2011-’12, school districts got an average of 43 percent of their revenue from property taxes, although the range was 14 percent to 93 percent, according to the Wisconsin Department of Public Instruction.) To back its claim against Burke, the Republican Party cited not only property tax levies but total budget figures, so we’ll examine both. 1. Preliminary 2012-’13 budget Burke joined the majority on the school board in a 6-1 vote on June 18, 2012, to approve the school district’s preliminary budget for 2012-’13. It would have raised the property tax levy by 4.95 percent. The school district’s portion of the property tax bill for the average Madison home, valued at $232,000, would have increased $91. 2. Final 2012-’13 budget Burke joined in a 7-0 vote on Oct. 29, 2012, that gave final approval to the 2012-’13 budget. It included a smaller levy increase than the preliminary budget -- 1.75 percent. That meant an $8 increase on the property tax bill for the average Madison home. The size of the total budget, taking into account all sources of revenue, rose by 4.3 percent. So, for her first annual budget, Burke voted twice in favor of raising property taxes and the size of the total school district budget. 3. Preliminary 2013-’14 budget On Aug. 26, 2013, the school board voted 6-1 to to approve a preliminary budget for 2013-’14. A final vote is scheduled for Oct. 28, 2013. Burke was the lone dissenter. The property tax levy would increase nearly 4.5 percent, boosting the property tax bill by $119 on a typical Madison home. Despite her no vote, Burke indicated she was open to a property tax increase. Several weeks before the preliminary vote, she told The Capital Times regarding property taxes: "I think in an environment where we’ve seen real wages in Dane County decrease, and a lot of people are on fixed incomes, we have to work as hard as possible to limit any increase to the inflation rate." As for the total budget, it would actually decrease, by less than half of a percentage point; but, again, Burke voted no. So, for her second budget, Burke expressed being open to a relatively small property tax hike, but voted against a preliminary plan that would carry a larger levy increase but a smaller total budget. Our rating The Wisconsin Republican Party said Burke "has proven on the Madison Board of Education" that she supports raising taxes and spending. Burke voted for a larger total budget, which included a property tax increase, for 2012-’13. In a preliminary vote for 2013-’14, she opposed a property tax increase that was larger than she advocated; that was part of a proposal that actually reduces the size of the total budget. For a statement that is partially accurate but leaves out important details, we give the state GOP a Half True.

pomt-03012	Says U.S. Rep. Steve Daines, R-Mont., "opposes a vote on his own legislation that he proposed just a few months ago."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2013/oct/15/democratic-senatorial-campaign-committee/democrats-say-rep-steve-daines-wont-back-his-own-b/	No great insight is necessary to predict that both parties will aim to use the government shutdown to their advantage in the 2014 elections. The political jabbing is already underway in the Montana Senate race to replace Sen. Max Baucus, a Democrat, who won’t run again. The Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee attacked Rep. Steve Daines, R-Mont., the state’s only House member and a likely contender for Baucus’ seat. "Daines is irresponsibly doing everything he can to make sure the reckless Republican government shutdown continues no matter how dire the consequences are for Montana," the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee wrote in a press release. "In fact, Daines is so thoroughly wedded to his partisan political shutdown that he opposes a vote on his own legislation that he proposed just a few months ago." In this fact-check, we’ll look at whether Daines actually opposed a vote on a bill he introduced. We contacted the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee and spokesman Justin Barasky noted that back in March, Daines cosponsored a bill called the Government Shutdown Prevention Act. The gist of the measure, endorsed by 16 Republicans and no Democrats, is that if the parties couldn’t come to terms, government agencies could stay open, funded at the same level they are today. If four months went by and there was still no deal, agencies would absorb a 1 percent cut, and that would be repeated every three months until a more durable bill passed. House Democrats are circulating a petition that would force an immediate vote by the full House on the bill. Known as a discharge petition, it would override House leadership and for that reason, it is an unusual move that reflects a breakdown of party control. Daines will not sign the petition, not that his Democratic colleagues invited him to. They sent letters to 30 Republican representatives, asking them to join the effort, and Daines was not on that list. The discharge petition is no ordinary parliamentary tactic. A petition of this sort succeeds only when the speaker’s hold on his own party has failed. A discharge petition with a twist In the view of the Democrats, Daines has failed to do all he could to put his legislation to a vote. But the real story is more complicated. If the Democrats got the 218 votes they needed, presumably 200 Democrats and 18 Republicans, the special rule they proposed would lead to an immediate floor vote on an amendment to strip the original language from the bill and replace it with Democratic version that simply funds the government at current levels. The parts about automatic spending decreases would be gone. If that amendment failed, the bill would go back to the House Appropriations Committee and there would be no vote by the full House on the original measure. So the discharge petition forces a vote on a substitute for Daines' bill; it doesn't force a vote on the original bill text itself. Alee Lockman, Daines’ communications director, said he won’t sign because what would emerge wouldn’t be his bill. "The bill my boss cosponsored and the bill that would result through the Democrats’ discharge petition would not be the same," Lockman said. We contacted the office of another cosponsor of the bill, chair of the House Budget Committee Rep. Paul Ryan, R-Wis. His spokesman said for the same reason, he also had no plans to sign the petition. Independent analysts agree that Daines would not have the chance to vote on the measure he introduced. Donald Wolfensberger, an expert on House parliamentary procedure at the Wilson Center in Washington with long ties to the Republican party, affirmed that the Democratic measure "completely replaces the base text." Sarah Binder, a Brookings Institution fellow and professor of political science at George Washington University, said the Democrats’ petition leaves little room for what Daines had in mind. "I think we're talking about two different measures, and thus refusing to sign the discharge petition on the resolution does not signal a member's unwillingness to vote for a bill that she or he cosponsored." By Binder’s count, 407 discharge petitions have been filed since the end of WWII. Only 2 percent were successful. If you include instances when the threat of a petition forced House leaders to charge course, the track record rises but still only to 9 percent. Researchers Susan Miller and Marvin Overby at the University of Missouri looked at a dozen years of recent congressional activity, and their results tell us that Daines has a lot of company in refusing to sign a discharge petition for a bill he introduced. Miller and Overby found that when the sponsor or cosponsor comes from the party in power, they refuse to sign about 80 percent of the time. Our ruling The Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee said Daines opposes a vote on legislation he introduced. Democrats are seeking House members to sign a discharge petition to bring the legislation Daines introduced for a vote, and Daines won’t sign. However, the Democratic move would take away all the relevant text of the original bill, replace it with new language, leaving in place only the original bill number. Independent experts said that Daines would be voting on a measure that is substantially different from the one he put his name to in March. We rate the claim False.

pomt-08166	In Wisconsin, "deaths from domestic violence are at the highest in 10 years."	true	/wisconsin/statements/2010/dec/02/gwen-moore/us-rep-gwen-moore-says-domestic-violence-deaths-wi/	When U.S. Rep. Gwen Moore (D-Wis.) was honored by the National Network to End Domestic Violence, she issued a statement saying "we have a real crisis on our hands." In Wisconsin, her Oct. 7, 2010, statement read, "deaths from domestic violence are at the highest in 10 years." Indeed, eight days earlier, the Wisconsin Coalition Against Domestic Violence released a report that made that claim. According to her spokesman, Moore based her statement on a Milwaukee Journal Sentinel article about the report. The article said domestic violence "claimed 67 lives" in 2009. We wondered: Does that mean domestic abusers killed 67 people? And is that number, as Moore claimed, a 10-year high? The Wisconsin Coalition Against Domestic Violence, like the national organization that honored Moore, is an advocacy group committed to ending domestic violence. It has produced a "domestic violence homicide report" each year since 2000, using data from crime report summaries from local police agencies and from various news articles. The coalition defines homicide as "the killing of one human being by another." But its annual homicide reports actually count more than that. As in previous years, the 67 deaths in the 2009 report included homicides in commonly understood domestic violence cases -- such as when the victims and perpetrators were spouses or partners, former spouses or partners, or adults with children in common. Homicides of other people are counted if, for example, a woman’s current boyfriend kills the woman’s former boyfriend; if a third person trying to protect a domestic violence victim kills the perpetrator; or if the domestic violence victim kills the perpetrator in self-defense. But the Wisconsin coalition -- as it clearly notes in its report -- also adds suicides committed by domestic violence perpetrators. For example, it counts the January 2009 death of a Fond du Lac County man who took his own life after shooting his wife to death outside their home. All told, the coalition says that in 2009, "there were 47 domestic violence homicide incidents resulting in 67 deaths -- 52 homicides and 15 perpetrator suicides." Many people would not consider a domestic violence perpetrator who committed suicide to be a domestic violence victim. The coalition says it has always included perpetrator suicides in its annual tallies because they occurred as a result of a domestic violence incident, said spokesman Tony Gibart. By the coalition’s count, the 67 total deaths in 2009 was the highest in 10 years, exceeding the previous high of 61 in 2003. Excluding the suicides, the 52 other domestic violence homicides also were the highest in 10 years, exceeding the previous high of 45 in 2003. So, Moore accurately quoted the group’s statistics, and those statistics have been consistently handled -- even though including the suicides increases the number. We checked a few other states for how they tally domestic violence deaths: Illinois: In its most recent report, the Illinois Coalition Against Domestic Violence counted 76 homicides between June 2009 and May 2010. It did not include perpetrator suicides. Minnesota: The Minnesota Coalition for Battered Women, which tallied 25 domestic violence homicides in 2009, says it does not include perpetrator suicides because its focus is on the women, men and children who are murdered in domestic incidents. "There’s no national standard way of reporting" domestic violence deaths, but counting perpetrator suicides is not common, said Shellene Johnson, the Minnesota coalition’s program manager. We also asked a state agency, the Wisconsin Office of Justice Assistance, if there are official statistics on domestic violence deaths. The answer is, not exactly. Homicides tracked by the office are not identified in terms of whether they were the result of domestic violence, and suicides are not tracked at all. The office can infer which homicides were domestic, based on the relationship between the offender and the victim as recorded in police reports, said spokeswoman Tami Jackson. But unlike the Wisconsin Coalition Against Domestic Violence, the office does not look more closely into the circumstances of the deaths, she said. That brings us back to Moore’s claim. The Milwaukee congresswoman said deaths in Wisconsin from domestic violence "are at the highest in 10 years." Moore accurately quoted statistics compiled by an advocacy group for 2009. It’s important to note the group includes suicides committed by domestic violence perpetrators, which makes the death tally higher than it would otherwise be. Even so, either way you track it, the 2009 numbers were at a 10-year high. We rate Moore’s statement True.	None	Gwen Moore	None	None	None	2010-12-02T09:00:00	2010-10-07	['Wisconsin']
pomt-12553	Says Milwaukee County Sheriff David A. Clarke Jr. has said Black Lives Matter "is a terrorist movement, a hate group and calls it, Black LIES Matter."	true	/wisconsin/statements/2017/apr/17/sheriff-david-clarke-us-senate/pro-sheriff-david-clarke-group-says-clarke-called-/	A committee aiming to persuade the "people’s sheriff" to run for the U.S. Senate is raising money by highlighting the African-American’s inflammatory statements about Black Lives Matter. It’s no secret that Milwaukee County Sheriff David A. Clarke Jr., a Donald Trump supporter and nationally known conservative, has harshly criticized the group. Yet, we wondered if he has gone as far as the Sheriff David Clarke for U.S. Senate draft committee says he has. As reported by the liberal magazine Mother Jones, the committee sent a fundraising email on April 5, 2017 that suggested several reasons why Clarke would make a good senator -- starting with this one: "Milwaukee’s conservative black Sheriff CORRECTLY says ‘BLACK LIVES MATTER’ is a terrorist movement, a hate group, and calls it ‘Black LIES Matter.’" The committee also makes the statement on its website. Let’s look at each of the three parts. The committee Sheriff David Clarke for U.S. Senate is not a committee authorized by Clarke, but is registered with the Federal Election Commission as an official draft campaign. It has attacked first-term U.S. Sen. Tammy Baldwin, a Democrat, for being a lesbian as part of its effort to get Clarke to run against her in 2018. Clarke has not ruled out a run, but hasn’t expressed strong interest, either, while a number of Republicans have. For her part, Baldwin has said Clarke is "being groomed" to challenge her, and has raised campaign funds herself off his possible candidacy. While a favorite of the right, Clarke has drawn criticism for his racial remarks as well as for his performance as sheriff as he increasingly spends time on national television and traveling the country on speaking engagements. He has also said virtually nothing about four inmate deaths in the jail he manages that are under investigation. Now to the statement about what Clarke said. ‘Hate group’ Black Lives Matter formed after a Florida jury in 2013 found George Zimmerman not guilty of murder in the shooting death of Trayvon Martin, an unarmed African-American teen. Describing its aim as rebuilding "the black liberation movement," the group has participated around the country in demonstrations, including some around Milwaukee, about police killings of black people. Clarke called Black Lives Matter a "hate group" in a July 2016 opinion column he wrote for FoxNews.com and has made any number of similar references such as these: "I wish the Southern Poverty Law Center would add them (Black Lives Matter) to the list of hate groups in America … this hateful ideology of Black Lives Matter." -- Fox News’ "America’s News HQ," July 31, 2016 "Black Lives Matter are purveyors of hate. It is a hateful, violent ideology." -- Fox News’ "Hannity" show, July 17, 2016 Black ‘Lies’ Matter Clarke has used "Lies" instead of "Lives" in referencing the group many times, including in his memoir, released in February 2017, and on CNN and Fox in 2015. In the Fox interview, he elaborated on why, saying: "The whole thing is built on a lie, the whole premise is built on a lie. But it’s a conglomeration of misfits. You have Occupy movement, you have organized labor in on it now, you have criminals, you have black racialists, you have cop haters and anarchists have now formed together this faux movement, if you will." ‘Terrorist movement’ Clarke hasn’t used a terrorism reference nearly as often, but he does so twice in his book: Black Lives Matter does not "care about black lives. They care about their own radical ideology of terrorism: anarchy." "In the five days surrounding the Dallas shooting -- which was the worst police massacre since 9/11, by the way -- there was even more Black LIES Matter-inspired violence (four attacks on police are listed)….Let me guess. You’d never heard of these incidents. That’s because the media protect and lie about this insidious terror organization." Clarke also predicted on Twitter in 2015 that Black Lives Matter "will join forces with ISIS to being (sic) down our legal constituted republic." And in a July 2016 column he wrote for The Hill, he said: "We have several forces internal and external attacking our rule of law: ISIS, Black Lives Matter, Occupy Wall Street – just the most recent iterations of the elements who brand themselves as unique but seek the same revolutionary aim: take down the West …" Our rating The Sheriff David Clarke for U.S. Senate draft committee says that Clarke said Black Lives Matter "is a terrorist movement, a hate group and calls it, Black LIES Matter." Clarke has repeatedly used Lies instead of Lives in labeling the group, and has repeatedly called it a hate group. In his memoir, he calls the group a "terrorist organization."

pomt-05586	Says Barack Obama's health care law "will be the biggest job-killer ever."	false	/florida/statements/2012/apr/02/rick-scott/rick-scott-calls-health-care-law-job-killer/	As Supreme Court justices embarked on three days of oral arguments in the historic lawsuit over the health care law, Gov. Rick Scott went on a national TV media blitz and said one of the most regurgitated falsehoods of the health care debate. "I ran on a campaign of getting our state back to work. This will be the biggest job-killer ever," he said on Fox and Friends on March 26, 2012. "I mean, think about it, the government can’t buy health care cheaper than anybody else can. And we have these unbelievable penalties, which will have to go up." "It will be a big job-killer because it will cost too much," he said. PolitiFact has examined similar claims about the law’s job-killing effect from House Republican Leader Eric Cantor, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and former U.S. Senate candidate and former Florida House Majority Leader Adam Hasner. None fared well on our Truth-O-Meter. We wanted to rule on Scott’s statement given renewed debate on the law. We’ll explain how we examined the "job-killing" rhetoric in the past before getting around to Scott specifically. None of the folks who made the claim before now could back it up with valid projections of job losses, and instead presented partisan reports or skewed interpretations of independent reports as evidence. One Republican document, "Obamacare: A Budget-Busting, Job-Killing Health Care Law," claimed "independent analyses have determined that the health care law will cause significant job losses for the U.S. economy." It cites a 2010 report by the CBO, which analyzes the impact of legislation, that allegedly determined the law would lead to roughly 650,000 lost jobs. But the report didn’t say that. It said the reduction in the amount of labor in the economy would be "roughly half a percent" -- and not because of onerous regulation. Some workers around retirement age may decide to stop working earlier than they planned, the report states, pointing to the affordability of insurance to be offered outside of the workplace. The same report says the law may also mean more people seek jobs because of a Medicaid expansion that allows more low-income people to work and still qualify for the program. The CBO does highlight a part of the law that will likely lead to lost jobs: the requirement that businesses with 50 or more workers pay a fee if they do not offer health insurance (or if the plan they offer falls short on some criteria and at least one employee receives a subsidy from the to-be-created insurance exchange). This fee, CBO states, will be passed on to employees through reduced wages and other compensation. Because some businesses pay a chunk of employees at minimum wage, it’s inevitable that some will take on fewer low-wage workers. They may also respond by hiring more part-time or seasonal employees. That’s as specific as it gets in the CBO’s update. Why? Because it will take time to assess the effects of the law, most parts of which won’t be implemented for another couple of years. Another source the Republicans have used for backup is pretty irrelevant now. The National Association of Independent Business said in a 2009 report the impact of a provision requiring businesses to offer insurance would lead to the elimination of 1.6 million jobs, two-thirds of which would be from small business. But the blanket employer mandate did not make it into the final law, which exempts companies with 50 or fewer employees from any mandate. The NFIB produced a more recent study in November 2011 blasting another part of the law: an escalating annual fee (starting in 2014) on the health insurance sector that the group says will be passed on to businesses through increased premiums. This requirement, which the lobbying group calls a health insurance tax, would lead to lost private-sector jobs between 125,000 and 249,000 in 2010, the group said. Job losses would total 4,700 through 2021 in Florida. We’ve found a few problems with NFIB research in our past stories. For starters, it’s not really independent in the ideological sense. The lobbying group opposes policy that places a financial burden on business and sued against the health care law at the Supreme Court. In other words, it’s not exactly our go-to source for objectivity. Still, we dug into the substance of their claim that the law will cost hundreds of thousands of private jobs in our most recent check of this job-killing claim. Several skeptical experts told us the impact would not be that big, pointing out that employer payments under the law are small, and that the NFIB’s research doesn’t factor in new tax credits under the law for small businesses, which would actually lead to savings in premium contributions. "The rhetorical hysteria explicit in the term ‘job killer’ is enough to make one despair for rational public debate," said Henry Aaron, senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, in a February email with PolitiFact. Like CBO, we’ve cautioned that a discussion of what the law will or won’t do is mostly based on speculation. Even when parts of the law go into effect in 2014 (barring Supreme Court action), we won’t know if it has a drastic effect on jobs until the years that follow. Our friends at FactCheck.org arrived at the same conclusions we did about the job-killing threat in January 2011. So what about Scott? Could he cite new, compelling evidence for this well-worn claim? "It’s a prediction based on conversations with business owners and other job creators," spokesman Brian Burgess wrote in an email. He didn’t elaborate. Analyzing the truthfulness of predictions is tricky business in which we normally prefer not to delve. But the job-killing claim is widely spread, and does not carry proof. Scott’s spokesman said this is a prediction based on anecdotal conversations with business owners. We say it’s not one steeped in credible, independent evidence -- it’s more like a scare tactic. We rule this claim False.	None	Rick Scott	None	None	None	2012-04-02T11:42:20	2012-03-26	['None']
pomt-10157	Says McCain "voted to let governments charge rape victims" for forensic exams.	pants on fire!	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/oct/01/planned-parenthood/ad-distorts-mccains-record-on-violence-against-wom/	A new ad from Planned Parenthood makes two charges against Sarah Palin and John McCain. It says Wasilla, Alaska, charged rape victims for forensic exams when Palin was mayor and that, as a senator, McCain "voted to let governments charge rape victims" for forensic exam kits. We've examined the controversy over the Wasilla rape kit policy in this previous article, so here we'll examine the charge that McCain voted to let governments charge the victims. The ad begins with a rape victim named Gretchen who says, "I just didn’t think it would happen to me. I was drugged and raped." The announcer says, "Under Mayor Sarah Palin, women like Gretchen were forced to pay up to $1,200 for the emergency exams used to prosecute their attackers." The screen says "Charged rape victims for exams - Source: CNN, September 22, 2008." (We reported earlier that Gretchen is from Illinois, not Alaska , and was not subject to the Wasilla policy.) The announcer continues: "In the Senate, John McCain voted against legislation to protect women from these same heartless policies" while the screen says, "Voted to let governments charge rape victims." Gretchen then says, "That is something to me that’s unthinkable. It scares me to death." The screen attributes the McCain allegation to a vote on Aug. 25, 1994, on a crime bill that included the Violence Against Women Act, which itself included a provision that required states to provide free forensic exams for rape victims. Planned Parenthood's logic: Because McCain opposed that bill, he voted to let governments charge victims for their rape kits. That's quite a stretch. Indeed, McCain voted that day against a conference report on the crime bill, but he opposed it not because of the Violence Against Women provisions, but because it included extra spending that McCain considered unrelated to crime and it had a provision that would have banned so-called assault weapons. Nine months earlier, McCain had supported the original bill, which included the Violence Against Women Act, when it passed the Senate 95-4. So that alone is a significant contradiction of Planned Parenthood's claim. Also, McCain has supported the Violence Against Women Act when it has come up for reauthorization. In 2000, McCain joined a unanimous vote on a crime bill that included the Violence Against Women Act. In 2005, he praised the law when he introduced a companion bill to provide protections for Indian women. "The 1994 Violence Against Women Act has had a tremendous impact on raising the national awareness of domestic violence and providing communities, including Indian tribes, the resources to respond to the devastating impact of domestic violence," he said. When we asked Planned Parenthood if it had any other evidence to bolster its claim, spokesman Tait Sye scrounged up a few more: a vote against a 2008 justice spending bill that included all justice programs (McCain opposed it because it had too many earmarks), and a couple of other votes that are not directly related to the rape provision of the Violence Against Women Act. That's the best they got? That's the classic kind of cherry-picking we've seen in campaign ads and it is flimsy evidence for the serious charge that McCain opposed the program, especially in light of his clear support at other times. Planned Parenthood has virtually nothing to back up its charge that McCain voted to let states charge for rape exams. Sure, McCain voted against a larger crime bill in 1994, but that vote was about assault weapons and spending, not the Violence Against Women Act. And McCain has supported the law before then — and twice since. Planned Parenthood's claim isn't just False, it's ridiculously so, which merits a Pants on Fire.

pomt-09922	Even high estimates for an early draft of the health care plan are "less than the $1.8 trillion cost of the Bush tax cuts."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/jun/24/paul-krugman/bush-tax-cuts-health-care-probably/	Paul Krugman, a noted economist and a columnist for the New York Times , made the case in a recent column that Democratic senators need to unite to pass health care reform. "I'm not that worried about the issue of costs," Krugman wrote. "Yes, the Congressional Budget Office's preliminary cost estimates for Senate plans were higher than expected, and caused considerable consternation last week. But the fundamental fact is that we can afford universal health insurance — even those high estimates were less than the $1.8 trillion cost of the Bush tax cuts." We wanted to know if Krugman was right that the initial cost estimates for health care legislation by the Congressional Budget Office were less than "the $1.8 trillion cost of the Bush tax cuts." The CBO released its study of a draft bill from the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions (HELP) on June 15, 2009. The report concluded that the plan would cost $1 trillion between 2010 and 2019. It also said the plan would reduce the rolls of the uninsured by 16 million, which is only about a third of those currently without insurance. (So the plan as rated is not "universal.") Those findings have fueled debate. Opponents of health care reform said they show the plan is too expensive and won't cover everyone. Health care supporters said that the draft legislation does not include all the major elements of health care reform that will increase coverage or reduce costs, such as a public option health insurance plan or requirements for employers to contribute to insurance plans. But the draft bill is the best we have to work with, because so far it's the only one rated by CBO, a nonpartisan group that estimates the cost of legislation. Next, we wanted to put a price tag on the Bush tax cuts. Krugman doesn't give a time frame for the $1.8 trillion price tag. The law was written so that the tax cuts expire in 2010, and we think that's the time frame he was talking about. (We e-mailed him about this but didn't hear back.) Looking back, how much have the Bush tax cuts cost us so far? There's not a CBO report on that puts a dollar figure on that, and different think tanks calculated the lost revenues different ways. Keep in mind, we're talking about estimating something that didn't happen: How much in revenues didn't the government collect? Economic conditions change over time, and changes in tax code can affect that. So it's not a straight-up calculation. The left-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities agrees with Krugman. The center's 2009 report on the Bush tax cuts states: "The 2001 and 2003 tax cuts added about $1.7 trillion to deficits between 2001 and 2008. Because they (were) financed by borrowing — which increases the national debt — this figure includes the extra interest costs resulting from that additional debt. This figure also includes the cost of 'patching' the Alternative Minimum Tax to keep the tax from hitting millions of upper-middle-class households, a problem the tax cuts helped cause. Over the next decade (2009-2018), making the tax cuts permanent would cost $4.4 trillion, assuming that the tax cuts remain deficit-financed." We then asked the conservative Heritage Institute about the Bush tax cuts. Brian Riedl analyzes the federal budget for the group. He said Krugman's $1.8 trillion number only considers the government's lost revenue, and doesn't account for the economic activity that lower taxes generate. He said the number was "defensible, but an overstatement." He estimates there would be a stimulative effect from tax cuts that could shave about 25 percent off that tally. Still, he said, Krugman is in the right ballpark for a static score of uncollected revenues. "I can't believe I'm actually saying one of Krugman's numbers is defensible," he added. There's one other implicit assumption in Krugman's statement. He writes, "But the fundamental fact is that we can afford universal health insurance — even those high estimates were less than the $1.8 trillion cost of the Bush tax cuts." We know the CBO report scored the first draft at $1 trillion, but we also know that CBO determined the draft was not a "universal" plan — only about a third of the uninsured would be covered. But would a truly "universal" bill still come in under $1.8 trillion? "Absolutely," said Kenneth Thorpe, a health care expert at Emory University. He said draft version of the bill could be modified to expand coverage to everyone and trim costs, and he thinks the total cost of that would likely be just over $1 trillion. He said the Senate Finance Committee is working on a new plan, though it has not been released to the public. "I think that you can provide universal health care coverage for all 46 million of the uninsured for just over $1 trillion," he said. After reading many studies on the cost of the Bush tax cuts, it seems to us that Krugman is in the ballpark with his $1.8 trillion estimate. But we believe there are a couple of important caveats to his comparison. First, his wording implies that CBO's much-discussed estimate is for universal coverage, but it's not. Also, he doesn't offer a time frame for the Bush tax cuts, so we can't be sure he is comparing the same number of years. Finally, the health care plan is still very much in flux, and the CBO estimate is based on an early and incomplete bill. So we find Krugman's claim Mostly True.

pomt-02304	The NCAA will "get billions" from the men’s basketball tournament. "Players get a trophy."	half-true	/punditfact/statements/2014/apr/01/arian-foster/arian-foster-ncaa-gets-billions-players-get-trophi/	As the final four teams in the NCAA basketball championship get ready to play this weekend, the top question on the mind of virtually every sports fan is which schools will win. (At PunditFact, we like Florida.) But let the record show that at least one man has made up his own mind on the ultimate victor. Arian Foster, an NFL running back with the Houston Texans, was asked for his pick in the 68-team tournament. His tweeted reply? "NCAA will win. They'll get billions, players get a trophy," Foster wrote. Ouch! At a moment when most people care about individual achievement and team cohesion, Foster is looking at the role of filthy lucre. We decided to see whether the facts back up his claim that the NCAA will get billions from the tournament, while the players will take home mere trophies. We tweeted to Foster and did not hear back. We also sent an email to the NCAA press office and got no reply. But there’s enough information on the public record to get some clarity. Ideally, we would have revenue numbers for this year, but we’ll have to make do with financials from 2013. From the NCAA’s home city of Indianapolis, the Indianapolis Star culled through the organization’s financial statements and reported that in 2013, the tournament brought in nearly $770 million, or about 84 percent of the organization’s total revenues. That’s big money but it isn’t billions. Furthermore, the NCAA shared most of that with the member colleges and universities. About $525 million passed from the NCAA to individual schools. These numbers are in line with NCAA financial reports we found for 2012 and 2011. Now, not all of the money that went to the schools ended up with the student-athletes. Regardless if they win during March Madness, they do get more than a trophy. The largest benefit comes in the form of athletic scholarship dollars. Known as grant-in-aid, student-athletes received the equivalent of $125 million in the 2012-13 season, according to the Indianapolis Star. This covers tuition, room and board and books for the players. The average grant across all sports and all divisions in the NCAA was over $13,000 for men and $14,000 for women. All of these disbursements from the NCAA cover all sports, not just basketball. A smaller fund, the Student Assistance Fund, is awarded on a case-by-case basis. The value last year was about $73 million. So in round figures, student-athletes got about $200 million out of the total revenues, or about a fourth of it. There is one other pot of money -- worth about $25 million -- that pays for tutors and other support to help the players keep up their grades. We didn’t include it because this is an indirect benefit. These scholarships might not be as generous as they would seem -- a fact that has led some to call for additional compensation for players. We came across studies that concluded that many athletes find that their scholarships don’t cover the full cost of their education. Some finish their time in school saddled with debt but with no diploma. Still, if Foster was talking about a single year, these numbers don’t back him up. While there are signs that revenues will be higher this year and could cross the $1 billion mark, it would require a doubling of revenues to get to billions (plural). That doesn’t seem likely. However, if we look at the next 10 years, the NCAA is completely in the multi-billion dollar zone. Its 2011-24 contract with CBS Sports and Turner Broadcasting is worth at least $10.8 billion. That is the largest single revenue stream and there are others. In this longer time frame, Foster is correct about the riches flowing to the NCAA. It is harder to know what would happen to the grants flowing to the players. Under the current NCAA by-laws, schools are not allowed to give students more than the actual costs of going to school. It is possible that revenues will rise faster than the cost of higher education. As a result, players will get a declining share of the proceeds. A pending lawsuit aims to overturn the NCAA limits on financial rewards to players. This raises issues of fairness but our fact-check deals only with whether the players get some monetary benefit and clearly, as a group, they receive substantial sums. Our ruling Foster said that the NCAA gets billions, while the winning players walk away with just a trophy. The revenues that come from the college basketball championship might be close to $1 billion, but there’s no sign that they have reached the $2 billion level. In addition, much of that money leaves the NCAA and goes to the schools. About a quarter of the total turns into scholarships for student-athletes. If Foster was talking about the NCAA’s lucrative multi-year contracts with broadcasters, his numbers are more accurate on the revenue side, but players still end up getting a lot more than a trophy. We don’t know what he had in mind. Overall, Foster’s point that the NCAA and colleges get a lot more out of the deal than the players is accurate. His specifics, however, are off. On balance, that comes to a Half True.	None	Arian Foster	None	None	None	2014-04-01T18:12:31	2014-03-19	['None']
pomt-01394	"As mayor, [Allan Fung] raised taxes three times."	mostly true	/rhode-island/statements/2014/oct/14/american-leadhership-pac/american-leadhership-ad-ignores-three-years-allan-/	He's the only candidate in the race for Rhode Island governor who has been in a position to raise taxes. So it's not surprising that Allan Fung, the Republican mayor of Cranston, has come under attack for -- wait for it -- raising taxes. A new ad titled "Allan Fung - An Insider's Insider" by the American LeadHERship PAC, a political action committee that is focused on electing Democrat Gina Raimondo, asks, "What do we really know about Allan Fung?" The ad calls him "a career politician" and says, "as mayor, he raised taxes three times." Fung became mayor in 2009. He has repeatedly acknowledged that he raised taxes three times during his six years in office. But he also inherited a huge pension problem, a budget that had $1.5 million in phony savings, and a school committee that had spent about $8 million it didn't have. His first year in office was marked by a massive cut in state aid that rocked cities and towns. And, with the Great Recession in full swing, it didn't get easier for him or other mayors. For example, early in his term, general revenue sharing, where the state gave about $55 million from sales and income taxes to municipalities, was eliminated. But he and the city ultimately stabilized the budget and during the last three of his six years in office, the city has not raised taxes. In the end, the statement in the American LeadHERship commercial is accurate. But because it leaves out the important context of the three most-recent years in which he did not raise taxes, we rate it Mostly True.

pomt-10038	Louisiana is turning down $100 million "that would require us to change our unemployment law, that would have actually raised taxes on Louisiana businesses."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/feb/24/bobby-jindal/jindal-unemployment-measure-stimulus/	Since the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act became law on Feb. 17, 2009, a few Republican governors have said they don't intend to accept some of the money, saying it comes with too many strings attached. That includes Gov. Bobby Jindal of Louisiana, who appeared on Meet the Press on Feb. 22. "Why would you turn down $100 million for federal unemployment assistance for your state?" asked moderator David Gregory. "You're talking about temporary federal money that would require a permanent change in state law," Jindal said. "The $100 million we turned down was temporary federal dollars that would require us to change our unemployment laws, that would've actually raised taxes on Louisiana businesses. We as a state would've been responsible for paying for those benefits after the federal money disappeared." Gregory then quoted Louisiana's Democratic senator, Mary Landrieu, saying that Jindal's claims were "inaccurate," but Jindal stuck by his statement. First, we have to note that while $100 million sounds like a lot, it is actually a relatively small portion of Louisiana's stimulus package. Jindal has said he intends to accept federal money that will pay for a $25 per week increase in benefits for unemployment recipients, as well as money for transportation projects. Landrieu says the transportation money should total $430 million, and that the state will get $718 million in stabilization funds aimed at schools, and another $752 million for agriculture and rural development. When you factor in money to the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and other federal projects, Louisiana will ultimately receive "billions" from the package, Landrieu said. But Jindal is rejecting money that the federal government is offering states to loosen their rules governing unemployment compensation. (Find it under Sec. 2003, "Special transfers for unemployment compensation modernization. ) The incentive varies by state, but Louisiana's take is about $100 million, or more precisely $32.8 million with the potential for another $65.6 million. The first change the federal government wants is known by the lovely jargon "alternative base." It makes slight changes to the formula states use when determining if workers qualify for cash payments. Basically, it would allow more low-wage and seasonal workers to be eligible for unemployment, a method already used by 19 states. Jindal believes this change would cost Louisiana up to $12 million a year, and the experts we consulted said that estimate sounded about right. After Louisiana used the $32.8 million, it would have to come up with $12 million a year on its own. If Louisiana agreed to that measure, it could try for the $65.6 million by extending its unemployment provisions even further — such as covering people who seek part-time work or those who leave their jobs for a "compelling family reason." To take only the first provision into account, Jindal is saying that Louisiana would get $32.8 million in funds up front for potential ongoing expenses of $12 million a year, which he says is not much of a deal. And he is saying businesses, which pay the taxes that fund unemployment compensation, would get a tax increase to pay for that. But he sidesteps two key points: The $12 million a year is not a solid number — it could conceivably drop if the economy improves and more people get jobs. And state officials may decide to pay for it in ways other than a tax increase. Wayne Vroman, an economist with the nonpartisan Urban Institute who studies unemployment insurance, said there's a good chance the tax increase would not be needed. "There's a kind of balance through having more stimulus that would tend to reduce future taxes," Vroman said. A business-oriented group, UWC-Strategic Services on Unemployment & Workers' Compensation, was less optimistic about avoiding a tax increase, but the group's president said it's not clear how much taxes would have to go up. "I think it's fair to say that there would be some increase in taxes to pay for additional payouts," said Doug Holmes. "How much will that be? When would the tax kick in? It's really hard to speculate about that." Holmes also said that business taxes for unemployment in most states will rise dramatically next year regardless of whether states take the incentive money or not. That's simply a function of the downturn in the economy and the way the taxes are calculated. Clearly, Jindal's comment is speculative in some respects. But it's also logical to think that expanding unemployment insurance will cost more, and that the government will have to find that money, possibly increasing taxes on the employers who pay into the fund. On the other hand, some states might be better off giving workers the money and getting their local economy back into gear. Certainly the stimulus bill itself does not specify tax increases for unemployment. Given all these factors, we find that Jindal's statement is largely correct. He is right that the $100 million he turned down would have required Louisiana to change its unemployment law. But he can't be sure that it would mean higher taxes based on that alone. It depends how the economy rebounds and how the costs are allocated. The law itself does not require tax increases. For this reason, we find his statement Mostly True.

pomt-08271	"Anybody who is familiar with the historical data from the IRS knows that raising income tax rates will likely actually reduce federal revenues."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/nov/09/mike-pence/mike-pence-says-raising-taxes-lowers-tax-revenues/	On one side, we have David Stockman, the budget director for President Ronald Reagan. On the other, it's Rep. Mike Pence, the conservative Indiana Republican and potential presidential candidate. The venue: This Week with Christiane Amanpour. The topic: What's worse, raising taxes or letting the deficit run wild? Stockman said the deficit could ruin the country and savaged the Republican Party's refusal to consider tax increases. "Both parties, unfortunately, became free lunch parties, the Republicans cutting taxes every time they had a chance, never doing anything about spending, and the Democrats digging in to defend everything that was there," Stockman said. "As a result, we now have this massive deficit. ... This will not end well. It's going to end in a disaster." Pence agreed that Republicans had wrongly allowed spending to increase during the George W. Bush administration but said that Republicans were now more committed to reducing government. "We think we ought to go back to pre-stimulus, pre-bailout levels, and freeze there," Pence said. "There's been an 84 percent increase in domestic spending since this administration took office. We've got to roll back there. That will save $100 billion in the first year. How about a net hiring freeze on Capitol Hill? ... For Americans under the age of 40, we've got to put everything on the table in the area of Medicare, Medicaid, Social Security. We have got to reform these entitlement programs. They are threatening the fiscal vitality of future generations of Americans." Not good enough, said Stockman: "Social Security needs to be means-tested right now, not for benefits in 2030, right now, for the top one-third of beneficiaries who have private income that they've earned over their lifetime. We need to drastically scale back Medicare. And the Republicans expanded it. And I appreciate what Mike is saying, but there's no track record of a willingness to take on the doctors, the pharmaceutical companies, the scooter chair manufacturers, who are everywhere. (And) we need to take on defense ... We can't be the policemen of the world anymore because we can't afford it. We're going to have to cut defense drastically. And that isn't just fraud, waste and abuse. It's force structure, fewer divisions, fewer aircraft carriers. And even if we do all that, we still have to raise revenue." Raising revenue means a tax increase, which Pence said was a bad idea. And Pence further argued that a tax increase wouldn't help anyway: "David believes that every tax increase equals a revenue increase, but that's not true. Anybody who is familiar with the historical data from the IRS knows that raising income tax rates will likely actually reduce federal revenues." That's what caught our attention as fact-checkers. How can raising taxes not raise money? And does the historical data really show that? First, we should note that if you take Pence's statement at its most literal, it's not correct. The Internal Revenue Service has published detailed tables of tax collections, and they go up almost every year. They went up after tax increases passed in 1990 and 1993, and, when taxes were cut in 2001, collections dropped. But it's a bit more complicated than that. If you're not an economist, it sounds counterintuitive to claim that raising taxes gets you less money, but there is some logic behind the theory. You have to start with the idea that government can tax people so much that it creates a disincentive to work. Let's start with an extreme: If you tax people at 100 percent -- which means you'd take all of their income -- people quit their jobs, and you'd get zero dollars in taxes. And rates that are close to 100 percent create similar disincentives. Back in 1980, for example, tax rates were much higher than they are now, with marginal tax rates on the highest incomes at 70 percent. Today, the top rate is half that -- 35 percent. During the Reagan years, economists postulated that you could cut that top rate, which would stoke economic activity and produce more tax revenues. (You might remember terms such as supply-side economics or the Laffer curve that offer explanations for the theory.) And this seems to be where Pence is coming from. During the 1980s, Reagan cut taxes, and tax revenues did go up almost every year. But we consulted the tax experts, who told us you can't just look at the raw numbers, for several reasons. First, you should expect tax revenues to go up each year due to economic growth and inflation, even if tax rates stayed the same. Second, there's not a straight line between tax rates and tax revenues. You can raise taxes the same year the economy tanks and get less revenue, or you can cut taxes during a time of economic growth and get more revenue. And those changes in the economy aren't necessarily caused by what the government is doing with tax rates -- the upturns could be due to new inventions and innovations, and the downturns could result from financial panics and real estate bubbles that have little to do with tax rates. And economists have to go to quite a bit of trouble to separate out the effects of tax policy from other things happening in the world. We also consulted a 2006 Treasury Department report that examined the revenue effects of major tax law changes since World War II. The report examined tax revenues generated by various tax law changes as a percentage of the Gross Domestic Product, a measurement that accounts for economic growth and inflation. The laws that reduced tax rates produced declines in revenues, and the laws that increased tax rates produced increases in tax revenues. So this too contradicts Pence's claim. Interestingly, Stockman agreed with a little bit of Pence's underlying assumption that increases in taxes can inhibit economic growth. But he disagreed that tax revenues would decrease if the government raised taxes. "I just have to respectfully disagree," Stockman said. "You will have some loss of revenue because some activity or transactions won't happen, but if you raise taxes on paper by $100 billion, maybe you'll get $90 billion or $85 billion. But it's just common-sense fact that, when you raise the rates, you get more revenue. Normally, it's a bad thing to do. But we are in such dire shape that we have no choice but to accept the negative trade-off of some harm to the economy to start paying our bills." The tax experts we spoke with agreed with Stockman. In this climate, raising the top tax rates from 35 to 39.6 percent would increase revenues. The effect Pence is talking about would not happen at this level of taxation, they said. "There is some rate at which it would be true," said Roberton Williams of the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center. "But I don't think there are any established economists who would argue that we're near that." "At current tax rates, most tax increases will increase revenues, at least in the short and medium run," said Brian Riedl of the conservative Heritage Foundation. "The caveat is that in a fragile economy, it can be unpredictable." "There is no real dispute among economists that broad-based federal income tax cuts reduce revenue (except when tax rates are much higher than they are now)," said Alan D. Viard of the conservative American Enterprise Institute. "Revenue is lower than it would be without the Bush tax cuts -- liberal and conservative economists are in accord on this question." To recap, Pence said that, "Anybody who is familiar with the historical data from the IRS knows that raising income tax rates will likely actually reduce federal revenues." Actually, the historical data doesn't show that. Experts said the economic theory Pence is drawing from doesn't apply in the current situation, and an increase in tax rates would not cause tax revenues to decline. So we rate his statement False. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/99d4f639-1c35-43e2-8ba7-3480dabc1ce7	None	Mike Pence	None	None	None	2010-11-09T16:30:32	2010-11-07	['None']
pomt-03118	The Capitol Police force is "going so far as to use paramilitary equipment" in dealing with singing protesters in Madison	mostly false	/wisconsin/statements/2013/sep/18/chris-larson/chris-larson-says-capitol-police-are-using-paramil/	Arrests and escalating tension became routine at the longrunning Solidarity Sing Along protests at the Capitol rotunda in Madison after a judge left in place for now the state's authority to require a permit to protest when more than 20 demonstrators gather. Many refused to get permits after the July ruling, and Capitol Police responded with arrests after trying futilely to shout warnings into bullhorns as a chorus of protesters drowned them out. The noontime protests began in 2011 in reaction to Gov. Scott Walker’s move to sharply curtail union collective bargaining power. In early September 2013, trying to break the standoff over the singalong arrests, a top legislative Democrat took both the singers and the Walker administration to task. "I think the singers are in the wrong and should get a permit if they are going to protest on a continuous basis and they know they are going to be there," Senate Minority Leader Chris Larson of Milwaukee said Sept. 5, 2013 on "The Devil’s Advocates Radio show (WXXM-FM 92.1 in Madison). "I agree with many of their protests, I agree with where they’re coming from, but I think it’s a simple act ..." Then Larson caught our attention with this: "At the same time, I think that Walker is overstepping his bounds and is in the wrong by enforcing this to the extent that he is, in giving his police chief a raise in a shadowy way, and is going so far as to use paramilitary equipment to try and shut down the voices of the protesters. So both sides could take a step towards the middle." We’re familiar with the controversy over the use of a ghost job to give the new Capitol Police chief a double-digit pay raise. But Larson’s line about "paramilitary equipment" employed by the Capitol cops was a new one for us. The phrase conjures up images of officers in riot gear and flak jackets, and advanced weaponry inside the Capitol, where -- we should note -- arrests have tapered off dramatically in September. Larson’s office told us the "equipment" in question is one device that broadcasts a message warning protesters they are subject to arrest unless they disperse. The machine can emit a high-pitched noise, we were told. With a bit of research, we found that protesters here and elsewhere call the machine a "sound cannon" or "sonic weapon." And with a bit more research, we learned that state officials term it an "advanced microphone." Sounds like a job for the Truth-O-Meter. The equipment in question is described by its manufacturer as the hand-held LRAD 100X "long range acoustic device." It and its much larger cousins have come under scrutiny as crowd-control and communication mechanisms in clashes between police and protesters in Occupy Wall Street demonstrations, at the NATO summit in Chicago and elsewhere. The device’s loudspeaker function cut through crowd noise and clearly communicate at up to 1,000 meters, its maker, San Diego-based LRAD Corporation, says. Protesters who’ve labeled it a cannon have focused on the high-pitched, high-decibel "warning tone" the machine can emit. The continuous squeal sent street protesters scurrying away at the G-20 summit in Pittsburgh in 2009. Regarding the warning tone on the LRAD 100X model used at the Capitol, the company’s website says: "The warning tone provides a non-lethal deterrent, shapes behavior, and supports intent determination while preserving time for force escalation." Translation: the tone can get people’s attention, get them to momentarily stop what they are doing or move out of the way. At very close range (about 3 feet), the 100X’s warning tone puts out 137 decibels continuously. Brief exposure to noise at 120 dB (a nearby clap of thunder) or 140-190 dB (gunshot) can cause immediate hearing damage, according to the Dangerous Decibels project. LRAD spokesman Robert Putnam told us that putting hands over your ears or stepping six feet out of the narrow sound field can remove the risk of injury. But here’s the deal: With the exception of a brief test, it appears that Capitol Police in Madison are not using the warning tone. We watched dozens of YouTube videos taken by protesters, and talked to people who’ve observed most of the rallies, and could find evidence of only one rally at which police briefly sounded the continuous shrill warning tone. That was on July 18, 2013, which our research shows may have been the first day the police put the device into use. A spokeswoman for the state agency that oversees the Capitol Police, told us the device is not being used "in that manner" but declined to discuss the July 18 video. "It would be inaccurate to say that the (Capitol Police Department) uses the LRAD in a harmful manner – they use it make an announcement," state Department of Administration spokeswoman Stephanie Marquis said. "There is a brief beeping right before the announcement starts ..." On July 18, the video shows, uniformed officers accompanied by a man in street clothes walked the device in with the warning squeal activated. "Watch out, there’s a sleeping child," an off-camera man says to them. The warning tone sounded for at least 20 seconds and crowd reaction to it appeared minimal. In Madison, a story in Isthmus, the Madison weekly newspaper and website, on the July 18 protest called the device a "loudspeaker." On that day and others we observed on video, officers stationed themselves one floor above the ground floor of the rotunda where most singers gather. One officer holds up the 14-inch by 14-inch black speaker while another works the microphone and MP3 player containing the message to disperse. It did not appear that arrests were made on July 18. Overall, then, the evidence strongly suggests that police are using the machine to get a message out before making arrests, not to drive people off with an annoying or threatening warning tone. Paramilitary in nature? Larson described the device as "paramilitary" in nature. In recent years, as critics have complained about the militarization of police forces, the "paramilitary" label has been attached to a variety of gear, notably that used by military-style special weapons and tactics (SWAT) units. Things like body armor, shields, night vision goggles, armored vehicles. The marketing of the acoustic devices suggests it fits into multiple categories, including military, paramilitary, and traditional law enforcement. LRAD Corporation created it following the 2000 terrorist attack on the USS Cole. Since then, the military, companies -- and more than 100 law enforcement agencies including National Guard units -- have put them to use in diverse ways including fending off pirates, issuing storm warnings, serving warrants and for SWAT operations, riot control, hostage situations and crowd control at large events and protests. In war zones, soldiers have mounted units to vehicles or used them at security checkpoints to communicate with civilians in order to avoid potentially lethal misunderstandings, said Putnam. So there’s no doubt they have military and paramilitary applications, and are marketed as such. Still, they can also be used purely as communications devices, as the Capitol Police in Madison appear to be doing. The devices, we found, do not appear on a list of "paramilitary" equipment outlined in United Nations sanctions documents banning batons, clubs, riot sticks, body armor, riot shields and whips. A detailed 2011 Canadian police review of law enforcement use of LRADs said they have been called both "weapons" and "devices." The review recommended that police factor in volume control and standoff distances when using the warning alarm function. Our rating Larson said the Capitol Police force under Walker is "going so far as to use paramilitary equipment" at daily singalong protests in Madison. There’s an element of truth to his claim, in that these devices have paramilitary and military uses. But they also are used by a variety of non-military agencies for communication and mass notification, and Capitol Police appear to have used them predominantly, if not almost exclusively, to make sure protesters are clued in that arrests will follow if they don’t disperse. Unlike in Pittsburgh and other cities where police have used the devices, we found no scenes here of stunned protesters scurrying away in the face of ear-splitting noise. Our definition of Mostly False is that a statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression. We think that fits here.

pomt-14287	The "rate of uninsured Americans (is) 8.8 percent."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/apr/05/barack-obama/barack-obama-jumps-gun-us-uninsured-rate-then-reve/	On the sixth anniversary of his signing of the Affordable Care Act, President Barack Obama took a victory lap on Medium. In a brief article punctuated by several celebratory photographs, Obama wrote, "20 million. That’s how many people now have the health coverage they need thanks to the president’s health care law. In fact, for the first time ever, more than 90 percent of Americans have health coverage, putting the U.S. rate of uninsured Americans at 8.8 percent." When we began to check the percentage of uninsured Americans, we found some discrepancies. After we told the White House about our concerns -- but before we were able to publish our fact-check -- the White House made a change to the text of the Medium post and noted that a correction had been made. The White House confirmed that it had changed the language after our inquiries. Fact-checker success! We’ll address the White House’s correction and change in this fact-check, but our policy is to fact-check the way a claim was phrased originally. The confusion generated by this case stems from the reality that there are several different measurements of uninsured Americans, each with their own benefits and drawbacks. (The Kaiser Family Foundation has assembled a helpful cheat sheet to sort through the various measurements.) The gold standard of measurements is considered to be the data collected by the U.S. Census Bureau. However, the bureau only publishes its uninsured number once a year, and the figure released most recently -- 10.4 percent uninsured for calendar year 2014 -- is out of date. Here’s the summary of the Census Bureau’s most recent data. A more frequently updated yardstick -- released every quarter -- is Gallup-Healthways Well-Being Index. The most recent number from Gallup, for the fourth quarter of 2015, shows the uninsured rate at 11.9 percent. That’s higher than what Obama cited in his Medium post, but Gallup’s figure is always a bit higher than other numbers because it only surveys adults. On average, adults are somewhat more likely to be uninsured than children. Here’s what Gallup’s recent trend line looks like. When we asked health policy experts if they could think of what Obama might have been pointing to, they suggested the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's National Health Interview Survey. The most recent data from this survey covers the first three quarters of 2015, making it the most recent large-scale federal source for data on the uninsured. Using this survey, Obama came pretty close: The uninsured rate through September 2015 was 9.1 percent, and as the chart below shows, this came after consistent declines in the uninsured rate since 2010, the year the Affordable Care Act was signed. Still, the White House specified an uninsured rate of 8.8 percent. So where did that come from? To get there, the White House relied on Department of Health and Human Services projections of the uninsured rate through the first quarter of 2016 -- two quarters beyond the last hard data from the National Health Insurance Survey. Here’s a graphic from the Council of Economic Advisers illustrating what the White House did: What the White House did in this slide is a "reasonable approach," said Edwin Park, vice president for health policy at the liberal Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. Still, the problem with the wording in the Medium post is that the White House didn’t acknowledge that it was using a projection -- it used the present tense, suggesting it was citing current, validated data. When we contacted several health care experts before the White House changed the post, most agreed that the White House should have been more careful with its figures. "In the end, I don’t think a difference of 0.3 percent matters that much -- the 9.1 percent figure is an impressive achievement in and of itself," said Jonathan Oberlander, chair of the department of social medicine at the University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill. "But it would have been better for them to say something like the uninsured rate in September 2015 stood at 9.1 percent and they project that it has since fallen to 8.8 percent." Gail Wilensky, who ran Medicare and Medicaid under President George H.W. Bush, agreed. The actual numbers are "impressive on their own," she said. "There was no need to gild the lily." After our inquiry, the White House changed the 8.8 percent projection to the 9.1 percent figure offered by the CDC survey and noted the change with a correction. Our ruling Obama, in his Medium post, said the "rate of uninsured Americans (is) 8.8 percent." Hats off to the White House for correcting its post based on our inquiry, even before we could publish our fact-check. Still, we put claims to the Truth-O-Meter based on their original form, and in this case, Obama, despite being close to accurate, jumped the gun by shaving off a few tenths of a percentage point before they officially materialized. We rate this claim Half True.	None	Barack Obama	None	None	None	2016-04-05T15:32:52	2016-03-23	['None']

Who’s going to win? Who’s going to be the game’s most valuable player? Let’s hypothesize! NFL Hall of Fame running back Marshall Faulk says the MVP pick is "already etched in stone." Obviously, it’s going to be Denver Broncos quarterback Peyton Manning, he said during a face-off with Michael Irvin on the NFL Network. Faulk laid out pretty compelling evidence to make his case. "Quarterbacks, they have won the MVP more than 50 percent of the time," he said. Someone on Twitter heard Faulk’s claim and asked us if it is correct. Turns out Faulk is right. Of the 47 Super Bowls, 26 quarterbacks have walked away with MVP honors, way more than any other position, according to an ESPN tally. Victors include multiple winners such as Green Bay’s Bart Starr, Pittsburgh’s Terry Bradshaw, and San Francisco’s Joe Montana, as well as recent repeat winners in New England’s Tom Brady and the New York Giants’ Eli Manning. Peyton Manning could join the two-time MVP club Sunday night. He won the award for Super Bowl XLI in 2007 after passing for 247 yards and a touchdown against the Chicago Bears. For his MVP pick, Irvin chose Broncos wide receiver Wes Welker. Wide receivers and running backs are the next most likely positions for MVP, but they far and away trail the quarterbacks. (It’s a lot tougher for defense. The last defensive player to win the award was Tampa Bay Buccaneers safety Dexter Jackson in 2003.) We rate Faulk’s claim True.

Andy Barr "would let shady payday lenders take advantage of our troops" and that he took "$36,550 from payday lenders."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2018/oct/09/With_Honor/ad-accuses-andy-barr-allowing-payday-lenders-take-/	The "cross-partisan" group With Honor, which formed to support military veterans running for Congress, has backed Democratic challenger and Marine veteran Amy McGrath. McGrath is running against Republican incumbent Andy Barr for the U.S. House seat in central Kentucky’s 6th Congressional District. The September ad lambastes Barr’s support of the payday lending business. The ad says that Barr has accepted campaign donations from payday lending organizations and that he would let them take advantage of service members and their families. "In Kentucky, we respect our troops, but Congressman Andy Barr would let shady payday lenders take advantage of them," the ad says. It goes on to say that he took "$36,550 from payday lenders, then let them stick our troops with outrageous fees. It’s what’s wrong with Congress." It is no secret that payday lenders routinely sock consumers with excessively high charges and fees. But did Barr "let them" stick military families with outrageous fees, while also taking money from them for his campaign? Yes and no. First, some background According to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, "payday loans are small-dollar, short-term, unsecured loans that borrowers promise to repay out of their next paycheck or regular income payment." Payday loans often include very high interest rates or fees. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, formed under President Barack Obama through the Dodd-Frank Act in 2010, launched the nation's first program for supervising "non-bank" financial services, which include payday loan providers, as well as debt collectors, mortgage companies and credit-score companies. So what did Barr do, exactly? At issue is Barr’s 2017 vote for the Financial CHOICE Act, which passed the House but failed in the Senate. Barr was one of seven original cosponsors of the bill. The bill would make sweeping changes and repeal provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act, in part by weakening the power of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. Under the plan, the agency would lose its oversight of payday lenders. There is a line in the legislation that says, "the agency may not exercise any rulemaking, enforcement, or other authority with respect to payday loans, vehicle title loans, or other similar loans.’’ With Honor spokeswoman Ellen Zeng also pointed to a June 2017 Military.com article that grappled with whether the bill would undo certain protections for active and retired service members and their families. The bureau has played a major role in "providing restitution and help to troops taken advantage of by illegal financial practices," the article states. One program, in the bureau's Office of Servicemember Affairs department, has fielded over 74,000 complaints about predatory financial practices from the military community since 2011, a 2017 CFPB report says, resulting in more than $130 million in relief to affected service members. But then there’s the Military Lending Act Barr’s campaign released a statement after the ad aired calling it misleading. There are existing laws that protect military families from payday lenders, the campaign said. The 2006 Military Lending Act put a 36 percent cap on the amount of interest small-dollar lenders could charge on loans to military families. When veterans groups raised concerns about the Financial CHOICE Act, Rep. Jeb Hensarling, R-Texas, who sponsored the bill and chairs the House Financial Services Committee, said it would not touch protections for veterans. "The Financial Choice Act does not weaken the laws that specifically protect active-duty and retired members of our armed forces," he said in a June 2017 statement. Zeng says the group stands by the ad, as the bill would have drained the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, which she says plays a vital role in protecting military veterans and their families from predatory payday lenders. Did Barr collect over $36,000 from payday lenders? This part is pretty straight-forward. Yes, he did. According to the Center for Responsive Politics, an authoritative database of campaign finance data, Barr has accepted $36,550 from PACs and individuals associated with the payday lending industry since his 2014 campaign. He has received $7,500 from payday lenders in 2018. Our ruling With Honor says Barr "would let shady payday lenders take advantage of our troops" and that he received $36,550 in campaign donations from payday lenders. It is true that Bar has accepted $36,550 in donations from payday lenders. But the other part is more complicated. Barr voted for legislation that would weaken the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau’s power over payday lending agencies, which could indirectly affect military families as the agency fields complaints from the community. However, a 2006 law provides servicemembers protection, with a 36 percent cap on the interest small-dollar lenders could charge families. So while the CFPB could have provided more protections to the military community than the 2006 law, the ad makes it appear as if Barr’s actions were connected to legislation specifically about veterans.

pomt-12328	"The new Rasmussen Poll, one of the most accurate in the 2016 Election, just out with a Trump 50% Approval Rating. That's higher than O's #'s!"	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2017/jun/19/donald-trump/donald-trump-tweet-50-approval-cherry-picks-pollin/	President Donald Trump opened his first Father’s Day as president with a bright-and-early boast about his poll numbers. "The new Rasmussen Poll, one of the most accurate in the 2016 Election, just out with a Trump 50% Approval Rating. That's higher than O's #'s!" See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com Rasmussen Reports retweeted the president’s message (and so did more than 21,000 other accounts) despite some questionable logic. Trump cherry-picked his data Among pollsters, Rasmussen has consistently published higher approval ratings for Trump than its peers that track presidential job approval among Americans. Its June 13-15 poll of 1,500 likely voters did show 50 percent job approval for Trump, with a sampling margin of error of 3 percent. His numbers hadn’t hit the 50 percent-mark since late April, according to Rasmussen’s approval index history. Rasmussen’s numbers are atypical of the polls that have surveyed Trump’s approval ratings. The next-closest results were still pretty far from 50 percent. An Economist/YouGov poll of 1,500 registered voters from June 11-13 showed 42 percent approval. A June 9-15 Survey Monkey poll of adults showed 43 percent. Gallup, which polls all adults on a three-day rolling basis, most recently showed 39 percent approval. When you look at polling more broadly, Rasmussen really sticks out. The RealClearPolitics.com average of polls from May 30-June 17 shows 40 percent job approval -- a full 10 percentage points lower than the rate Trump touted in his tweet. FiveThirtyEight performs a similar comprehensive reflection of polling data, and it came in even lower -- 38.7 percent approval (and 55.4 percent disapproval) by Trump’s 150th day in office. Obama ratings weren’t as low at this point in his presidency What about Trump’s assertion that Obama fared more poorly? It’s not the case if you use the most apples-to-apples comparison: Rasmussen’s own polling at this stage of his presidency. Rasmussen’s results for Obama during the same period in June 2009 do not show an approval rating below Trump’s 50 percent. Obama’s approval ratings were between 54 and 58 percent through June 9-16, 2009, and they did not dip below 50 percent until late July of that year. Gallup’s tracking of Obama’s job performance showed a higher mark of 60 percent approval at that time. Of course, Obama’s approval rating did dip below the high 50s later in his presidency. Obama’s ratings in the Rasmussen poll did consistently fall below 50 percent from the fall of 2009 to the summer of 2012, and again from the summer of 2013 to the spring of 2016. However, experts caution that it’s most appropriate to compare presidents’ approval ratings at the same point in their presidency. Historically, most presidents have tended to have higher approval ratings early in the "honeymoon" period of their tenure before they sink, as some voters begin to tire of their policies. In addition, Obama periodically did reach 50 percent or more in Rasmussen polls even during his weaker periods, and when he didn’t, he was often within a point or two of that mark. This means it’s possible to do some reverse cherry-picking that makes Obama look better than Trump. Trump’s overall polling right now is far below what all past presidents have polled at an equivalent point in their first term. (Here’s a comparison of Gallup approval ratings for Trump’s predecessors, going back to Harry Truman.) What explains Rasmussen’s result? One reason why Rasmussen has shown higher ratings for Trump stems from its methodology. For one, it polls likely voters. Registered voters tend to offer higher job approval than surveys of adults more generally. And surveys of likely voters -- Rasmussen’s approach -- offer higher job approval ratings still. "As we move from all Americans, to registered voters, to likely voters, and to actual voters, the sample becomes more educated, more wealthy, and more Republican," said Steven S. Smith, a political scientist at Washington University in St. Louis. "Statistical weighting can reduce the bias. Rasmussen weights, but we know little about Rasmussen’s weighting procedures. The details matter." Meanwhile, polls that use live callers have been showing lower approval ratings than polls conducted by online or automated survey. Rasmussen uses automated surveys. "Automated polls only call landlines, which means they miss the roughly half (!!) of the American population that uses mobile phones only," FiveThirtyEight editor in chief Nate Silver wrote in February. "This matters because cell-only individuals tend to be younger, lower income, and more urban, all of which bias landline-only surveys in a conservative direction," Smith said. Each of these factors help explain the higher results for Rasmussen in Trump’s favor. We reached out to Rasmussen but did not hear back by deadline. Was Rasmussen 'one of the most accurate' polls in 2016? Finally, what to make of Trump’s implication that Rasmussen should be more trusted because it was more accurate than other pollsters about the 2016 election? The strongest evidence comes from looking at the final pre-election national polls. According to the rundown in RealClearPolitics, Rasmussen was the only pollster to get the popular vote result -- a two-point Hillary Clinton win -- correct in its final pre-election poll. Two pollsters (Monmouth University and NBC News/Survey Monkey) had Clinton winning by six points; four (ABC News/Washington Post, CBS News, Fox News, and Economist/YouGov) had Clinton winning by four, two (Bloomberg and Reuters/Ipsos) had Clinton winning by three, one (IBD/TIPP) had Trump winning by two, and one had Trump winning by five (Los Angeles Times/USC). However, it’s worth taking this with a grain of salt. First, the polls that had Clinton winning by two or three points were all very close to the mark once margins of error are taken into account. And second, Rasmussen was lucky to have its two-point margin come during the final pre-election poll. During the last week before the election, its daily results were scattered -- Clinton by three, tie, tie, Trump by three, tie, and Clinton by two. Overall, FiveThirtyEight’s comprehensive pollster ratings gives Rasmussen the mediocre grade of C-plus, and it found a two-point Republican bias in its polls. (This rating did not encompass the entire 2016 campaign, but it did go back earlier; it factored in 657 polls by Rasmussen.) Of course, Trump would not be the first president to tout an outlying poll result. "It is hardly new that presidents choose to talk about polls that support their view of the world and themselves," said Karlyn Bowman, a polling analyst at the American Enterprise Institute. Our ruling Trump said, "The new Rasmussen Poll, one of the most accurate in the 2016 Election, just out with a Trump 50% Approval Rating.That's higher than O's #'s!" There’s a grain of truth here: Rasmussen did put out that result two days before Trump’s tweet, and Rasmussen was closest to the mark among pollsters in its final pre-election survey. However, Trump has engaged in some serious cherry-picking. Other polling in this time frame shows approval ratings for Trump that are seven to 11 percentage points below Rasmussen’s finding. And contrary to Trump’s assertion, Obama’s numbers in the same poll at the same point in his presidency were higher than Trump’s current results. We rate the claim Mostly False.

pomt-02549	Says 85 percent of IDEA charter-school students come from low-income families and about 99 percent of its graduates go to college.	mostly true	/texas/statements/2014/feb/05/greg-abbott/idea-schools-serving-many-disadvantaged-background/	Visiting a Rio Grande Valley school run by a Texas nonprofit, Republican gubernatorial candidate Greg Abbott credited the program with thriving, according to a news story by the Rio Grande Guardian The story quoted Abbott, visiting IDEA Weslaco on Dec. 12, 2013, as saying that through competition, IDEA Public Schools, a tuition-free K-12 public charter system with more than 15,000 students in 30 schools, had forced nearby school districts to improve. The Dec. 17, 2013, story continued: "Abbott pointed out that 85 percent of IDEA students come from low-income families, many from colonias. However, about 99 percent go on to college." Abbott, the state’s attorney general, further said that his "goal of seeing the Texas education system rise to the No. 1 ranking in the country is achievable. When you have a school (IDEA) that can have such a large population of low-income students, including students from colonias, be able to come to the school, get a great education, have the dream of going to college and actually go on to college at the rate of 99 percent of the graduates, you see that the No. 1 ranking is within our grasp." A reader brought Abbott’s 85 percent/99 percent claim to our attention. Online, IDEA Public Schools describes itself as a growing network of tuition-free K-12 public charter schools serving schools throughout the Rio Grande Valley, San Antonio and Austin. IDEA Allan Academy and College Prep opened in Austin in 2012, offering kindergarten through grade two plus grade six, via an agreement with the Austin school district. The district then ended the partnership, but the school continued by moving to a temporary location and there are plans to build a permanent school in the Montopolis area in time to enroll students in kindergarten through fourth plus sixth and eighth grades in fall 2014, according to a Nov. 1, 2013, Austin American-Statesman news story. In its online history thumbnail, IDEA traces its founding to two Teach for America volunteers; IDEA is an acronym for Individuals Dedicated to Excellence and Achievement. The group also says: "IDEA is committed to ‘College For All Children.’" As the basis of Abbott’s statement, Abbott campaign spokesman Avdiel Huerta emailed us a one-page IDEA document with a chart indicating that of 950 program graduates from 2007 through 2013, 947 enrolled in college. The only year with a difference in high-school graduates and students entering college was 2013 when 429 of 432 graduates made that transition, according to the chart. By telephone, Tom Torkelson, founder and ceo of IDEA Public Schools, told us the group developed the document in December 2013 after Abbott started talking up its successes. He said far less than 10 percent of the students tabulated as going to college start at two-year community colleges. A background section of the document says the organization’s vision is to become the "number one producer of low-income college graduates in Texas." Starting in middle school, it says, students are taken on college field trips; parents go to college-centric workshops. High school seniors are coached on applying to, and enrolling in, college, the document states. "We do not rest until every IDEA graduate sets foot on their college campus the fall following high school commencement," the section closes. We asked Torkelson how many of its students ultimately finish college. He said that to date, 55 percent completed a degree in six years. "There is still some work to do," he said. And are most students from low-income backgrounds? By email, IDEA spokeswoman Vanessa Barry sent us a portion of IDEA’s state 2012-13 Academic Performance Report, also posted online by the Texas Education Agency. In 2012-13, according to the report, IDEA schools had 12,567 students in kindergarten through 12th grade, with 10,491 of them, or 84 percent, considered economically disadvantaged. State reports for previous school years, posted online, show the share of students deemed economically disadvantaged increasing from 72 percent of about 2,700 IDEA students in 2007-08 to 82 percent of about 9,500 students in 2011-12. By email, Michael Franco, IDEA’s chief of staff, said that as of Dec. 9, 2013, 87 percent of the IDEA students came from low-income households, though he cautioned such a figure would not be verified by the state until the end of the school year. Torkelson said the prevalence of students from low-income backgrounds is in keeping with where IDEA schools are located. He said students are not chosen based on family incomes. We also inquired into how many students choose not to remain in, or flunk out of, IDEA schools. Torkelson said that 5 percent of the IDEA students enrolled at the start of a school year have chosen to go to a different school by the start of the next year, not counting another 5 percent of students whose families move out of state. At our request, Julian Vasquez Heilig, a University of Texas associate professor of educational policy and planning, built a chart estimating the share of IDEA students who have left the school before graduation. His estimation, rooted in data reported by the IDEA schools to the Texas Education Agency, was that 508 students graduated from the schools from 2007 through 2012, while about 54 students left the schools before having a chance to graduate--a subset equivalent to 11 percent of the graduates over the six years. By telephone, Heilig said that generally, charter schools airing such notable success rates should acknowledge that they are describing solely the students who remained in the schools’ programs. IDEA’s 99-percent claim, Heilig said, doesn’t demonstrate that every student who attends its schools goes to college. We shared Heilig’s chart with IDEA’s leaders, who replied by email with a statement from Torkelson calling the school’s 99 percent figure "a fact that stands alone without the need for an asterisk. IDEA has been very open and clear that this number pertains to graduating seniors. Like other schools, both public charter and traditional who serve K-12 populations, IDEA does lose some students each year to a variety of factors (e.g. relocation, programs like traditional football that we cannot offer). However, this does not diminish the exceptional work of our students." Our ruling Abbott said 85 percent of IDEA students come from low-income families and about 99 percent of its graduates go to college. In 2012-13, 84 percent of IDEA’s students came from economically disadvantaged households and according to IDEA, more than 99 percent of 950 IDEA graduates since 2007 subsequently went to college. Then again, the 99 percent figure does not account for any of perhaps 50 IDEA students who left its schools without graduating from 2007 through 2012.

pomt-12823	Says a video shows "Coretta Scott King thanking Jeff Sessions for Rosa Parks library."	pants on fire!	/punditfact/statements/2017/feb/09/true-pundit/no-coretta-scott-king-didnt-thank-jeff-sessions-vi/	Coretta Scott King, the widow of slain civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr., died in 2006. But her opinion on the man who is now President Donald Trump’s attorney general is still being talked about today. Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., tried to read a 1986 letter by Coretta Scott King that criticized Sen. Jeff Sessions, R-Ala., as the Senate was considering his confirmation for attorney general. (He was ultimately confirmed on a near-party-line vote.) Before Warren could finish reading the letter, Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell successfully silenced her under an obscure Senate rule. The Senate’s decision to silence Warren energized her supporters. But it wasn’t long before conservative corners of the Internet tried to push a counter-narrative showing Coretta Scott King as favorable towards Sessions. On Feb. 8, an aggregation site called True Pundit published a post with the headline, "SHATTERED: Video of Coretta Scott King Thanking Jeff Sessions for Rosa Parks Library Crushes Elizabeth Warren Racial Stunt." Here’s the rest of the post, which also referenced a controversy over Warren and whether she had American Indian heritage: Well, that was quick. Sen. Elizabeth Warren’s racial stunt that sparked her removal from the senate floor Tuesday night proved even shorter than her time living in a teepee. Warren attempted to use the words of Coretta Scott King, the widow of slain civil rights hero Martin Luther King Jr., to smear Sen. Jeff Sessions’ bid for Attorney General. Warren’s now warrant-less claim was that King’s wife’s words framed Sessions as a bigot. But now a more recent video has surfaced where Coretta King in fact praises Sessions at the launching of the Rosa Parks Library and Museum. What a difference 12 hours can make. Several readers were curious about what the attached video showed, so we took a closer look. (True Pundit did not respond to an inquiry through its website.) The event in question was the Dec. 1, 2000, dedication of the Rosa Parks Library and Museum, located on the Montgomery, Ala., campus of Troy State University (since renamed Troy University). Parks had helped spark the civil rights movement in 1955 when she defied Alabama’s Jim Crow racial laws by refusing to relinquish her seat in the front of a municipal bus in Montgomery. Speakers at the dedication included Parks herself; Coretta Scott King; civil rights widow Juanita Jones Abernathy; civil rights leaders Johnnie Mae Carr, Dorothy Height, Evelyn Lowery, Elaine Steele, Mammie Till-Mobley; actor Cicely Tyson; and several elected and appointed officials, including Alabama Gov. Don Siegelman, Montgomery mayor Bobby Bright, Troy State-Montgomery chancellor Jack Hawkins and president Cameron Martindale, U.S. Transportation Secretary Rodney Slater, and Sessions. Here’s a transcript of what King said on the YouTube video embedded in the website. A complete video of her address has been archived by C-SPAN, starting around the 1:06:44 mark. To President Martindale, to Sen. Sessions, Mayor Bright, Troy State Chancellor Jack Hawkins Jr., Dr. Dorothy Height, Ms. Johnnie Carr, Juanita Abernathy, Mammie Till-Mobley, to all of the distinguished program participants and guests in this audience today, it's a great honor and a privilege for me to join you in celebrating the grand opening of the Rosa Parks Library and Museum. History teaches us that all great freedom movements begin with an inspiring act of courage, and in this regard the American civil rights movement provides a supreme example. The library and museum we dedicate today is a living testament to the courage, commitment and character of the great woman whose act of courage sparked our freedom struggle, the woman we call Mrs. Rosa Louise Parks. In her extraordinary courage and humility, Mrs. Rosa Parks provided our movement with a matchless example of the very spirit of non-violence. That was the only time King mentioned Sessions in her speech -- and it her words fall well short of "thanking" him, whether for his role in establishing the library or for anything else. She simply acknowledged his presence in the room, as she did with other dignitaries. We checked with Jeff Shesol, a former speechwriter for President Bill Clinton who is now a founding partner of West Wing Writers, which does speechwriting for a variety of clients. "This is the verbal equivalent of a wave or a handshake," Shesol said. "In speechwriting, we call this the ‘acknowledgments’ section -- a list of people that you simply have to mention, in passing, given their office or stature. The sort of people who you can't risk slighting by appearing to ignore them." Shesol said there is a separate category of salute that qualifies as a genuine thank you. "When someone needs to be singled out and thanked for their role in something, or for their contribution or leadership, that requires the speaker to pause and say something grateful and meaningful," he said. And King did just that later in her speech, in a portion not shown in the YouTube clip that True Pundit appended to its post. In her remarks, King specifically thanked the Montgomery Improvement Association and Troy State University for their efforts on helping establish the library and museum. "What you have here is a willful misinterpretation of a very basic gesture," Shesol said of the way True Pundit framed its post. Our ruling True Pundit said a video shows "Coretta Scott King thanking Jeff Sessions for Rosa Parks library." Even a cursory review of the video shows no such thing. King did acknowledge Sessions’ presence at the event, along with the presence of seven other dignitaries. But she did not go any further than mentioning his name. By contrast, she specifically thanked a local community group and the hosting university for their help in making the museum a reality. The website twists King’s actual words to a ridiculous degree, so we rate it Pants on Fire.	None	True Pundit	None	None	None	2017-02-09T15:00:17	2017-02-08	['Rosa_Parks', 'Jeff_Sessions']
pomt-10160	"Under Barack Obama's plan, the government would spend $1-trillion more."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/oct/01/republican-national-committee-republican/another-truth-o-meter-vs-spend-o-meter-smackdown/	Tweaking a line of attack it first employed in February, the Republican National Committee is charging that Americans would have to finance $1-trillion of new spending if Barack Obama fulfills all of his campaign promises over one term in the White House. And that’s above and beyond whatever the government decides to spend bailing out the financial system. A new RNC ad called “Worse,” unveiled Sept. 30, 2008, references the calamity gripping the financial markets and the taxpayer-funded bailout now under consideration in Congress, then contends Obama’s agenda would unleash geysers of additional red ink. “Wall Street squanders our money and Washington is forced to bail them out with – you guessed it – our money,” an announcer says. “Can it get any worse? Under Barack Obama’s plan, the government would spend a trillion dollars more – even after the bailout.” The ad has its genesis in a graphical device called the “Spend-O-Meter” that the RNC featured on its Web site during the primary season in an effort to depict both Obama and Hillary Rodham Clinton as tax-and-spend liberals. We’ve already ruled on its February claim that Obama wanted to spend $874-billion during his first term in office, concluding that the Republicans correctly identified about half of the Illinois senator’s proposals as new spending and made some highly creative assumptions about the rest. But how did the total balloon to the current $1-trillion? The biggest change is Republicans have revised upward their claim on how much Obama’s health care plan would cost. Obama wants to mandate that employers either offer health coverage or pay a sum equal to a percentage of their payrolls to fund a new national insurance plan. His campaign says this so-called “play or pay” approach would result in $50-billion to $65-billion in new costs to the government. The RNC, on the other hand, contends the plan would cost $150-billion a year, or $600-billion over four years, and bases its estimate on a Sept. 17 interview Obama gave 60 Minutes . (In February, the Republicans incorporated the Obama campaign’s high-end estimate of $65-billion a year, or $260-billion over four years, in their tally.) Here’s Obama’s exchange with 60 Minutes correspondent Steve Kroft: Kroft: “How much is it going to cost? $150-billion, right?” Obama: “It is. It is. But we pay for every dime that we propose to spend … Roughly speaking, I believe in pay-as-you-go. That if you want to propose a new program, you better cut some old ones. If you want to expand a program, then you better figure out where the money’s coming from.” It’s not clear to us why Obama agreed with Kroft’s figure when it contradicts his campaign’s own estimate. Regardless, it’s difficult to forecast with any accuracy what such an initiative would cost, in part because Obama’s campaign has yet to flesh out many details. The RNC makes the highly unlikely assumption that the health care plan would go into effect as soon as Obama takes office. And it doesn’t factor Obama’s companion proposal to cover much of the new cost by allowing President Bush’s tax cuts on dividends and capital gains for individuals making more than $200,000 a year to expire in 2010. An analysis of Obama’s plan by a group of conservative-leaning health policy experts in the Sept. 16 issue of the journal Health Affairs puts the likely cost at approximately $100-billion annually. The figure is based on cost projections of a proposal released by the nonpartisan Commonwealth Fund that shares certain features with Obama’s plan, including a mandate for employer-sponsored insurance. However, Commonwealth Fund president Karen Davis says the comparison is strained, because unlike her organization’s blueprint, the Obama plan doesn’t explicitly require adults to have health insurance. Davis added that Obama campaign also hasn’t specified eligibility criteria or the size of subsidies that would come from Medicaid and the federal State Children’s Health Insurance Program, both of which provide assistance to low-income Americans. So the Obama health plan remains something of a Rorschach test – an expensive big-government mandate to its critics, a fiscally responsible exercise in strengthening the social safety net to supporters. Call it what you want, but it’s almost pointless to attach a price tag until the Obama camp more clearly spells out its intentions. And the 60 Minutes interview seems like weak evidence, absent any change in policy, on which to hang an additional $340-billion spending claim. The next biggest item on the list is $156-billion to expand the Medicare Part D prescription drug program. Obama has said he wants to fix a "doughnut hole" in the program that leaves some mid-range drug prescription costs uncovered. The RNC doesn't mention that Obama proposes to pay for that with cost-saving measures, such as allowing the federal government to negotiate directly with pharmaceutical companies in setting Medicare drug prices. The campaign said it wouldn't close the doughnut hole if it couldn't find cuts to pay for it. Some of the Obama campaign's proposals and cost projections cited on the Republicans’ tally continue to be correctly categorized as new spending, in one form or another. They include: A plan to spend $18-billion a year on elementary education. Expanding the AmeriCorps national service program at a cost of about $3.5-billion a year. Doubling the size of a foreign assistance fund, from $25-billion to $50-billion, that’s aimed at meeting the United Nations’ Millennium Development Goal of reducing global poverty. Providing $2-billion in aid to Iraqi refugees in neighboring countries. Creating a $1.5-billion fund to help states implement paid-leave systems. Even Obama acknowledges uncertainty about his proposals given the downturn in the economy and the cost of the financial bailout. In the first presidential debate on Sept. 26, 2008, he said, "There's no doubt that we're not going to be able to do everything that I think needs to be done."

pomt-09728	A "massive" federal computer network will make your medical records available to "millions of people" with a "complete lack of privacy and confidentiality," while doctors and hospitals who don't take part face "stiff penalties."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/oct/22/senior-citizens-league/seniors-group-warns-about-risks-electronic-health-/	Could Big Brother — or garden-variety snoopers — soon get their hands on your medical data? The Senior Citizens League, a group that boasts 1.2 million members and is affiliated with the Retired Enlisted Association, recently sent out a mailing saying it was possible. According to a copy obtained by the Huffington Post, the group sent a four-page letter, along with a questionnaire and a cover letter signed by former Rep. David Funderburk, R-N.C., to seniors, expressing two related concerns about Democratic health care reform plans being debated on Capitol Hill. One is that they could lead to the rationing of care. The other is that the government is assembling a "national government computer network" that will contain Americans' medical files. We've already addressed the question of rationing , so we'll focus here on the plans for a computer network. Here's what the Senior Citizens League letter said: "The key to these changes is a massive national government computer network, which is now being created. When it is complete, your complete medical record will be available 24 hours a day to health care workers at computer terminals in pharmacies, doctors' offices and hospitals across the country and to government workers. ... To ensure that all doctors, hospitals and pharmacies participate and place their records in the new system, a portion of the economic stimulus legislation passed in February includes stiff penalties for doctors and hospitals which do not participate. The complete lack of privacy or confidentiality that comes when millions of people can see your records and the virtual certainty of computer errors has raised concern among many Medicare beneficiaries." First, a little background on health information technology, or HIT for short. Computerizing medical records has long been a goal of policymakers across the ideological spectrum. The idea is to shift from paper-based records to electronic ones, so that doctors can access information about their patients more quickly and easily and make better clinical decisions as a result. Supporters hope that HIT will reduce the frequency of medical errors, unnecessary diagnostic tests and inappropriate treatments. While the biggest impact would likely be felt within a patient's small circle of physicians, nurses and pharmacists, planners also envision scenarios in which an emergency room doctor treating a patient traveling far from home would be able to quickly receive medical records about that patient. Officials also hope that, in the longer term, streamlining record-keeping could bring down the rapidly escalating cost of health care. In 2004, President George W. Bush issued an executive order creating incentives for the use of health information technology, to be spearheaded by a new federal official, the national coordinator for Health Information Technology. President Barack Obama went further when Congress passed his economic stimulus package in February 2009. The stimulus included several items designed to promote HIT, including $19 billion over four years to fund electronic infrastructure improvements and the widespread adoption of electronic health records by providers. The goal under both presidents has been to create electronic health records for each person in the United States by 2014. The Office of the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology describes the Nationwide Health Information Network as a "network of networks." All the experts we spoke to, including the Department of Health and Human Services, emphasized that it is not a single database residing at, say, a federal agency. It's more accurately viewed as a network to link many separate databases where records already exist, such as regional databases or medical offices, along with efforts to establish common technical standards so that these far-flung repositories of data can exchange information as needed. "While providers will eventually be required to actively exchange patient information between electronic health records, there is no law or regulation calling for the development of a national patient information database," said Brian Wagner, the senior director of policy and public affairs with the eHealth Initiative, a group that represents companies and professional organizations with a stake in HIT. The Senior Citizens League excerpt raises two main questions about HIT. — Who would have access to the network? Could it be as many as "millions" of people? Our experts agreed that such loose access is certainly not the goal of the program, and they added that intensive efforts are being taken to prevent that from happening. On its Web site, the Office of the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology says it understands that a lack of trust in the system would be a serious problem. "Coordinated attention at the federal and state levels is needed both to develop and implement appropriate privacy and security policies," the office says. Portions of the stimulus bill stiffened existing privacy protections from the Health Information Portability and Accountability Act, which governs how medical records can be used. The stimulus extended the list of mandatory protections and penalties to business associates of medical providers who were already covered by them. In the case of privacy breaches, patients now must be notified, and the penalties for violations were increased. Most important, providers and associates covered by HIPAA must limit disclosure of private health information to the minimum number of people necessary to accomplish a valid purpose. Those purposes generally involve treatment, payment or medical administration. "It's not going to be available at Kinko's for all the world to see," said Len Nichols, director of the health policy program at the centrist-to-liberal New America Foundation. Wagner said that the network won't be structured in a way that allows any medical professional to fish around for data on anyone they like. Users would still have to request specific information from another doctor, and provide a good reason why they need it. The main difference under a functioning system of HIT would be that that record would be sent electronically rather than faxed or mailed, potentially saving hours or days. One upside is that, unlike paper-based systems, electronic health records create audit trails every time they're accessed, meaning that HIT systems can actually afford greater privacy protections for patients. "The level of access to this information will also be limited based on each person’s role in the provision of care," said HHS spokeswoman Nancy Szemraj. "Depending upon the type of violation, fines can reach up to $1.5 million per privacy violation." The notion that there will be "unauthorized, limitless access to patient health information in an electronic health record is absolutely incorrect," she said. Still, everyone agrees that vigilance is needed. Deven McGraw, director of the health privacy project at the Center for Democracy & Technology, calls it "absolutely critical to have policies to say who can access information and for what purposes. Are they in place today? No. Are there active efforts going on today to change that? Absolutely." — How stiff are the penalties for noncompliance? They're not immediate, and providers will have many opportunities to benefit from carrots before they face any sticks. Between 2011 and 2014, the stimulus provides bonus payments to encourage health care providers to implement "meaningful" usage of HIT for Medicare and Medicaid. In 2015, the penalties begin. Providers who haven't instituted meaningful use of HIT would see their Medicare reimbursements (though not their Medicaid payments) reduced by 1 percent in 2015, 2 percent in 2016 and 3 percent in 2017. The secretary of Health and Human Services can increase these penalties by an additional point or two if implementation significantly lags. So let's summarize. The Senior Citizens League has a point that HIT presents unprecedented challenges in privacy and security, and that strategies to keep up with these threats continue to evolve. However, the group significantly overstates the degree to which HIT is intended to collect medical data in one place and the extent to which users will be able to poke around records that they don't have a legitimate need to access. It's inaccurate to say that there will be a "complete lack of privacy or confidentiality;" laws against unauthorized use are already in place, and federal officials have explicitly made privacy a high priority. Finally, the penalties against nonparticipation that the group cites begin in 2015 — after several years in which providers can receive financial bonuses for participating. On balance, we find the group's claims Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.

pomt-09258	On transparency in dealing with the Republican Party of Florida's financial issues.	full flop	/florida/statements/2010/may/03/bill-mccollum/bill-mccollum-transparency-rpof-credit-card/	"Right now the party matters are totally internal … I don’t think it’s good for any political party to be having everything that’s done inside the party open to the public and the press." Feb. 9, 2010 "I think we need to have as much transparency as possible in the party. Always have thought that." April 27, 2010 ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Republican candidate for governor and Attorney General Bill McCollum says he always favored transparency when it comes to answering questions about the Republican Party of Florida's financial problems. Speaking to St. Petersburg Times/Miami Herald reporter Marc Caputo in the state Capitol courtyard on April 27, 2010, McCollum said that "I think we need to have as much transparency as possible in the party. Always have thought that." That's not what Florida Democrats say. They have accused McCollum of trying to sweep the state party's problems under the rug. "Why is Bill McCollum so scared of putting some sunshine in these dark corners?" Florida Democratic Party spokesman Eric Jotkoff said. "Good things never come out of shady places." The back and forth gives us an opportunity to use our Flip-O-Meter. In this item, we wanted to examine McCollum's statements on transparency. First, if you've missed the RPOF credit card saga, here's a recap: In August 2009, court records were released showing that indicted former House Speaker Ray Sansom charged $173,000 on his Republican Party-issued credit card, taking his family on a trip to Europe, making visits to Best Buy and spending thousands on flowers, clothing, meals and hotels. The records prompted some Republicans to criticize then-party Chairman Jim Greer. Greer cut up his party American Express to help mollify critics. But then, more credit card statements were leaked to the press -- statements from Greer, former House Speaker and U.S. Senate candidate Marco Rubio and RPOF executive director Delmar Johnson. The new statements led to more questions and led some party leaders to call for Greer's ouster. In January 2010, he resigned. Then came questions about questionable contracts to a business Greer and Johnson had an interest in, then more questions about credit card spending, then reports that the U.S. Attorney's office, the FBI, the IRS and the Florida Department of Law Enforcement were investigating. The RPOF kicked Greer out of his state committee post. Greer sued. The party leaders still standing faced questions about transparency -- specifically, when would they release all the financial records. Starting in February, McCollum was asked whether 1) The RPOF should release all of its credit card statements so party donors could see how their contributions were being spent, and 2) If he, as attorney general, should launch an investigation in the RPOF's spending practices. You can see the evolution of his answers over two weeks in February. Initially, in a Feb. 9 interview with reporters, he said the party should not release its credit card records. "That might be a question for the Legislature to decide, since the Legislature makes the rules for parties," McCollum said, according to the Orlando Sentinel. "Right now the party matters are totally internal … I don’t think it’s good for any political party to be having everything that’s done inside the party open to the public and the press. On the other hand I think it’s very important for the party regulars … all have a clear and confident understanding of what’s been going on in terms of everything, credit cards and bank accounts, everything else. I think that’s what’s been missing, and I think that’s what the next chairman will correct." Then, in a campaign statement on Feb. 11, he said the Republican Party should conduct a private audit of its finances before he would order a public state investigation. He said he wanted to wait until the state party chose Greer's replacement. "I share the outrage over recent revelations of extravagant contracts and lavish spending," McCollum said. "If audit findings suggest potential criminal activity, I will assist the State Executive Committee in directing these findings to the appropriate law enforcement investigatory agency. The old way of doing business at the Republican Party of Florida enabled an egregious and unforgivable violation of trust between Party leadership and our membership. Now it is time to clean up the mess. I support taking every measure possible to ensure we never again face the challenges before us today." On Feb. 16, McCollum again resisted calls for a public state investigation -- this time from Democratic attorney general candidates Dan Gelber and Dave Aronberg -- in comments published in the Lakeland Ledger. Finally on Feb. 20, after McCollum's choice for GOP chairman state Sen. John Thrasher was elected, McCollum called for a full internal forensic audit (as he said he would on Feb. 11), and urged that the results be released publicly (which he didn't say in the press release). If any potential illegal activity surfaced during the audit, he said it should be turned over to law enforcement. "Credit cards should be a part of that. Everything should be," McCollum said. The St. Petersburg Times noted after the Feb. 20 appearance that McCollum had "switched gears." "If there is any illegal or criminal behavior they discover - and they may or may not - I stand ready to assist you (Thrasher) in directing that to the appropriate law enforcement agencies,'' McCollum said at a news conference. On March 15, McCollum referred the results of the audit to the Florida Department of Law Enforcement for further investigation. On April 23, the state GOP executive committee voted to release all credit card statements to the public from party and elected officials. McCollum spokeswoman Kristy Campbell said McCollum has consistently pushed for greater transparency with members of the party and with the public and that McCollum "has taken a prime leadership role in working to address issues to regard lavish spending and fiscal mismanagement." And though it may not have happened happened right away, the party credit card statements from January 2007-February 2010 are being released and public investigations are under way. It should also be noted that Gov. Charlie Crist, not McCollum, had been the de facto leader of the state party until he decided to pursue an independent run for the U.S. Senate on April 29. But, we're here to judge McCollum's comments. For McCollum to say in April that he always has supported "as much transparency as possible" about the state party's spending records doesn't match his statements from February. Back then, he rejected calls to ask for the release of party credit card statements and said specifically that it's not good for all of the inner workings of a political party to be aired in the public. Only later did he say the state party's audit of its financial problems should be released to the public. And only after a private party audit suggested wrongdoing did he refer the case to the Florida Department of Law Enforcement. We rate McCollum's statements on transparency a Full Flop.

pomt-03571	A state report’s "projection is that approximately half of public employees" would live outside municipal boundaries in a decade if the state bans local residency requirements.	mostly false	/wisconsin/statements/2013/may/19/tom-barrett/milwaukee-mayor-tom-barrett-says-state-report-proj/	Milwaukee Mayor Tom Barrett is marshalling a big number as he continues his uphill battle to save a requirement that city employees reside in Milwaukee. Fifty. As in 50 percent. A frustrated Barrett met May 10, 2013, with Journal Sentinel reporters and editors, a day after an altered version of Republican Gov. Scott Walker’s proposal to wipe out all local residency rules for public employees won Joint Finance Committee approval. Republicans control both houses of the Legislature and the committee action suggests it will pass. Barrett repeated his concern that many of the city’s 7,200 city employees would move if residency is lifted, leading to a drop in property values. And he said there’s hard evidence of just how many. When asked "How many people do you think will actually leave in 10 years?" Barrett pointed to what he called a "projection" by the nonpartisan state Legislative Fiscal Bureau. The mayor quoted the state projection as "approximately half of public employees" living outside city limits will leave within 10 years. Barrett didn’t specify whether the state prediction was limited to Milwaukee or all municipalities that would have to dump residency rules, but the context of the question was clearly Milwaukee. When we asked Barrett spokeswoman Jodie Tabak for backup, she cited a May 9, 2013, fiscal bureau memo that examined the issue and laid out possible alternatives to Walker’s proposal. That memo at one point examined the possible economic impact of lifting residency for Milwaukee city employees. It did so by looking briefly at two large Midwestern cities with vastly different economies that lifted residency rules in 1999: Detroit and Minneapolis. (In both cases state lawmakers mandated the end to the municipal rules -- as Wisconsin lawmakers now seek to do.) Fifty-three percent of Detroit’s police force now lives outside the city, according to the fiscal bureau memo. That figure was reported by PolitiFact Wisconsin in 2011, when Republicans considered ending residency but pulled back. We rated as Mostly Truea Barrett claim that 53 percent of Detroit’s police force moved out when residency there was lifted. The fiscal bureau memo also focused on Minneapolis. "Recent estimates indicate that the percentage of city employees residing in the City has declined from nearly 70% when the requirement was in place to only 30% now," the memo said. (The Minneapolis residency requirement was only in place for six years, so not all employees were subject to it by 1999 when the rule was lifted.) Tabak said Barrett was referring to the Detroit and Minneapolis numbers when he made his claim. Barrett, though, said the fiscal bureau report contained a "projection" of what would happen here. Here’s the state memo’s only stab at that: "While the actual level of out-migration of public employees from the City of Milwaukee can only be speculated on at this point, two recent examples of other major Midwestern, U.S. cities that lifted their residency requirement may provide some insight," it said. Essentially, the memo said the Detroit and Minneapolis experiences could be suggestive, but it offered no prediction on Milwaukee’s "actual level." Tabak noted that the memo says: "Given that public employees, their unions, and associations want relief from the residency requirements in Milwaukee, it would seem somewhat evident that providing that relief could lead to some number of those public employees migrating out of the City." But that doesn’t tell us much, at least not in terms of a percentage. Before we wrap up, we should note that we found another example of a city that saw state lawmakers end residency requirements more than a decade ago: Baltimore, in 1995. As of 2012, 47% of Baltimore’s city workers lived outside the city, according to data on Open Baltimore. Among police employees, that spikes to 77 percent. So, in the three cities, large chunks of the workforce -- or at least the police force -- have chosen to live outside city limits a decade or more after the repeal of residency. Right around half of workers in fact; more in the case of Baltimore cops. But those figures look backward, at other cities. Barrett’s claim went further, saying a state memo forecasts a similar effect here -- approximately half, he said. There’s an element of truth in his statement, in that the state memo said the experience elsewhere "may provide some insight" into Milwaukee’s fate. And the experience in other cities may well play out here over time. But the state report stops well short of predicting Milwaukee’s experience. The mayor overreached in claiming an independent state report put a number on that. We rate Barrett’s claim Mostly False.	None	Tom Barrett	None	None	None	2013-05-19T09:00:00	2013-05-10	['None']
pomt-10387	"McCain lobbied for (a) $10-million pork project honoring conservative justice."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/jun/17/barack-obama/it-sure-looks-like-pork/	Sen. John McCain has a well-deserved reputation in Washington as a pork-buster. The presumptive GOP presidential nominee regularly castigates colleagues when they insert language in spending bills forcing taxpayers everywhere to pay for projects only of interest to a select few. In a recent e-mail to reporters, Sen. Barack Obama, the presumptive Democratic nominee, tries to paint McCain as a hypocrite, pointing out that in 2006, McCain co-sponsored legislation with fellow Arizona Republican Sen. Jon Kyl "that asked for $10-million for an academic center at the University of Arizona named in honor of William Rehnquist, the former U.S. Supreme Court chief justice." In essence, Obama argued, McCain had "lobbied for (a) $10-million pork project." The New York Times, which wrote about the bill in February 2006, reported that some saw it at the time as a pork-barrel project. Reporter Carl Hulse wrote that "while the goal" of a Rehnquist center "may be laudable," critics were calling it "a classic case of lawmakers' trying to funnel money directly to a home-state institution for a project that should find financing elsewhere." Aides to McCain told Hulse the difference between McCain's proposal and the projects McCain so often derides as "pork," lies in the way the project was pursued. Pork projects, the aides argued, are attached to massive spending bills with little or no debate. McCain's proposal was introduced as a standalone bill that could only advance with some measure of debate. In the end, McCain's bill never got out of committee. That's a fair point, but even McCain allies told the New York Times that it was the type of project that should be funded at the local level, or with private funds. "If it doesn't meet the technical term of earmark, it would probably meet the public idea of one," Pete Sepp, a vice president at the National Taxpayers Union, said at the time. We see McCain's point that pork projects are earmarks for funding that are attached with little or no debate to spending bills. McCain has long said the big objection to such projects is as much about the short-cut process for for approving them as it is about the value of the projects being funded. But another important aspect of a pork project is its parochial nature. Pork projects are typically only of interest to people in a particular region, and those people, pork-busters like McCain usually argue, should be the ones to pay for it. The latter is what's at stake in the request for $10-million for an academic center at the University of Arizona, even if it is named after the late U.S. chief justice. For a purist on spending like McCain, it's hard to argue this wasn't a parochial, pork-barrel project. As a result, we find Obama's charge Mostly True.

pomt-03722	Says Texas state funds were spent on "a TV series on spouses cheating on their wives, kind of glorifying the act of cheating."	mostly true	/texas/statements/2013/apr/15/jodie-laubenberg/jodie-laubenberg-says-state-money-supports-tv-show/	During floor debate, a Republican legislator complained that state expenditures on TV and film productions have extended to a long-running series celebrating cheating spouses. Really? Rep. Jodie Laubenberg of Parker initially asked a House colleague about his proposed amendment to the House version of the 2014-15 state budget. Rep. Jeff Leach, R-Plano, said he sought to shift money from the state’s film and music marketing fund to teacher pensions. When last we wrote about the fund, overseen by the governor’s office, we noted the 2011 Legislature had agreed to spend $16 million each year to "market Texas as a film location and promote the Texas music industry," according to the May 26, 2011, House-Senate conference committee report. Laubenberg asked Leach: "Would you like me to give you a couple of examples of things being funded with this money?" At Leach’s go-ahead, Laubenberg replied: "How about ‘Bad Kids Go to Hell,’ ‘Cheaters,’ ...a TV series on spouses cheating on their wives, kind of glorifying the act of cheating--yeah, entertainment for some, unless you’re the one cheated on." After listing other entertainment projects she described as helped along with state funds, Laubenberg closed: "You know, if you want to watch this, fine, but I think you ought to do it on your own dime and not the state’s dime." To our inquiry, Laubenberg later left a message saying she had been reading from a list provided by Leach, whose office emailed us a spreadsheet listing more than 400 projects. A header on the spreadsheet says each one was "paid" by the Texas Moving Image Industry Incentive Program through March 2013. More detail: The incentive program offers "qualifying productions" a shot at payments equaling 5 percent to 17.5 percent of the money they spend in Texas or 8 percent to 29.25 percent of eligible wages paid to Texas residents, according to agency information posted online, depending on budget levels and types of production, with both live-action and animated projects eligible. The spreadsheet’s sixth entry indicates $74,736.58 was paid March 22, 2013, to Bobby Goldstein Productions in Dallas in connection with "Cheaters," which is described on the sheet as a reality show. Lower entries show previous payments to the company in connection with "Cheaters," $72,714 in May 2012 and $100,082 in May 2011, respectively. By email, gubernatorial spokesman Josh Havens confirmed the state has paid about $248,000 since May 2011 to the Dallas company that produces "Cheaters," which is among several hundred projects benefiting from such aid. "The program met the incentive program requirements for economic impact and Texas resident employment," Havens said. By phone, the show’s executive producer, Bobby Goldstein, told us that he hires more than 20 full-time and probably 30 part-time employees for the show and the company contributes a lot in taxes. So, is the legislator correct that the series celebrates unfaithfulness? Not so, Havens replied, pointing out the message that appears at the start of each episode stating that from the program’s "surveillance cameras, you are about to view actual true stories, filmed live, documenting the pain of a spouse or lover caused by infidelity. This program is both dedicated to the faithful and presented to the falsehearted to encourage their renewal of temperance and virtue." (We confirmed the text here.) Goldstein said: "We don’t make this show and make it look like somebody did something good. We point out they did wrong. It’s sort of a scarlet ‘A.’" We viewed excerpts of episodes placed on YouTube by viewers. Our impression was the show centers on confrontations between purported cheaters, cheatees and, often, involved third parties. A vivid example involved a cheating man punching his irate girlfriend in a parking lot; blood runs. Another excerpt showed a man being confronted in a bed as a dominatrix edges out of camera range. Critic Pete Vonder Haar described the show this way in an April 25, 2012, account in the Houston Press, an alternative weekly. "The premise of the show is simplicity itself: a man or woman, suspecting their partner of philandering, contacts the steely professional ‘Cheaters’ investigative team. They, in turn, put the suspected party under surveillance, amassing evidence of their infidelity for presenting to the complainant. A confrontation is ‘arranged’ between the aggrieved party and their wayward lover. Hilarity then ensues, if by ‘hilarity’ you mean emotional breakdowns and the occasional threat of physical violence." The article, which Goldstein called accurate, says the show is primarily taped in the Dallas-Fort Worth area, though there have been Houston-area forays. "I’m not one given to hyperbole," Vonder Haar wrote, "but ‘Cheaters’ is as great an American institution as baseball and morbid obesity. Who but the good old U.S. of A. would so brazenly combine our love of moralistic posturing (the wayward partners are referred to as ‘suspects’ as if they were felons) with salacious, albeit (barely) pixelated footage of sexual transgressions." Finally, we revisited posted state guidelines for the incentives to see if any provision might restrict support for "Cheaters." The guidelines say projects not eligible for the aid include those considered obscene as that term is defined in the state’s penal code, meaning something the "average person, applying contemporary community standards, would find that taken as a whole appeals to the prurient interest in sex." The code further lists explicit acts defined as obscene and also says something is obscene if taken as a whole, it "lacks serious literary, artistic, political, and scientific value." Havens said in his email that the Texas Film Commission "felt the project fell well short of the definition of obscene." Our ruling Laubenberg said the state helped fund a show that glorifies cheating spouses. Mild point: The state-supported show, "Cheaters," doesn’t limit itself to exposing cheating spouses. We’re not sure, either, that everyone would agree the show glorifies infidelity, considering its theme is to expose the practice and touch off emotional confrontations. The legislator could have clarified that an intended point of the show is that cheaters are wrongdoers. We rate the claim as Mostly True.

pomt-12066	Says Lady Gaga was arrested after a confrontation with First Lady Melania Trump.	pants on fire!	/punditfact/statements/2017/sep/06/blog-posting/no-lady-gaga-was-not-arrested-criticizing-melania-/	A fake news items claiming that pop star Lady Gaga was arrested after criticizing Melania Trump is a hoax that’s been circulating since before the 2016 election. The story claims that Lady Gaga’s Nov. 6, 2016, tweet criticizing Trump set in motion a dramatic chain of events that unfolded days before the country would cast their ballots in the general election. ".@MELANIATRUMP to say u will stand for "anti-bullying" is hypocrisy. Your husband is 1 of the most notorious bullies we have ever witnessed," Lady Gaga tweeted. According to the fake account, just hours after the offending tweet, Gaga and Melania Trump met face-to-face, with Gaga hurling insults while the future first lady ignored the enraged pop star. That’s when Gaga threw something at Trump, according to fake witnesses, forcing the Secret Service to intervene. "The New York Post tried to reach out to the NYPD after it was reported that GooGoo was taken away in a black Yukon in handcuffs, but as of yet there’s no record of an arrest," the item read. "You can rest assured if this incident isn’t prosecuted by the corrupt liberals in the city government that the less-than-lady will be staring down the barrel of a multi-million dollar lawsuit." The item surfaced Sep. 3 on American Flavor, which we’ve previously labeled a fake news site. But the ersatz claim’s origins trace back to a Nov. 6, 2016, item on an outlet called America’s Last Line of Defense, a satirical site whose mission is to inflame conservative readers and draw them into mistaking extraordinary conspiracies for truth. A photo that ran alongside the original item purports to show Gaga being arrested. But as one eagle-eyed writer at Snopes points out, it’s actually a screengrab of actress Amanda Bynes being escorted into a courthouse in 2013. We rate this claim Pants on Fire!

pomt-11296	"James Comey Memos just out and show clearly that there was NO COLLUSION and NO OBSTRUCTION"	pants on fire!	/truth-o-meter/statements/2018/apr/20/donald-trump/trump-falsely-says-comey-memos-disprove-collusion-/	President Donald Trump claimed that memos written by former FBI Director James Comey "show clearly" that the Trump campaign did not collude with Russia during the 2016 election, and that Trump has not obstructed justice amid ensuing investigations. Comey, who Trump removed as FBI director in 2017, made detailed notes following seven encounters with Trump. Comey had testified before Congress about portions of the memos, but they became public in their entirety for the first time on April 19, which prompted Trump to claim the memos cleared his name. "James Comey Memos just out and show clearly that there was NO COLLUSION and NO OBSTRUCTION," Trump tweeted. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com Comey has said he made written records of his meetings with Trump in part due to concerns the president might lie about their discussions. Here, Trump’s tweet badly mischaracterizes their contents. Investigation ramped up since Comey’s firing Nowhere in Comey’s memos does he say that Trump did not collude or obstruct justice. Let’s recap how the memos came to be. In July 2016, when Comey was still FBI director, the FBI opened a counterintelligence investigation into links between the Trump campaign and the Russian government. After Trump was elected, Comey made contemporaneous notes of seven discussions he had with Trump. On May 9, 2017, Trump fired Comey as FBI director. From this point forward, Comey would have no role investigating Trump campaign ties to Russia. Later that month, Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein appointed former FBI Director Robert Mueller as special counsel. Mueller was authorized to lead the investigation into possible connections between the Trump campaign and Russian officials, as well as other matters that "may arise directly from the investigation." (Rosenstein was acting as attorney general in place of Attorney General Jeff Sessions, who recused himself from the investigation.) Here’s the key point: After the reins were passed from Comey to Mueller, the investigation into contacts between the Trump campaign and Russia escalated dramatically. Comey wasn’t in any position to make definitive statements about whether collusion existed or not. To date, Mueller’s investigation has swept up four members of Trump’s campaign, including three who have agreed to work with Mueller’s team as part of a plea deal. Mueller’s probe is ongoing, and he has yet to issue a final determination on the collusion question. Comey’s memos may figure into obstruction case The idea that the memos exonerate Trump on charges of obstruction of justice is even weaker. For starters, Comey’s memos contain details that many experts would consider legally relevant in an obstruction case against Trump. The memos describe a one-on-one dinner with Trump on Jan. 27, 2017, at the White House, where Trump turned the conversation to whether Comey wanted to stay on as FBI director. Comey has said he suspected Trump was seeking a "patronage relationship" with him. Comey’s memo goes on to state that Trump explicitly requested his loyalty later that evening, saying, "I need loyalty, I expect loyalty." The memos also describe a private meeting at the White House the following month, in which Trump asked Comey to drop the investigation into former national security adviser Michael Flynn, saying, "I hope you can see your way clear to letting this go." Finally, two days after Comey’s ouster, Trump said in a nationally televised interview that he’d been thinking about the FBI’s Russia investigation when he fired Comey. "When I decided to just do it, I said to myself, I said you know, this Russia thing with Trump and Russia is a made-up story," Trump told NBC’s Lester Holt. As in the case of the collusion question, Mueller has yet to issue a final determination on whether Trump obstructed justice. Comey: There’s ‘at least circumstantial evidence’ of criminal wrongdoing Even when the Comey memos are read in a light most favorable to Trump, they still don’t support his claim that the writings exonerate him. Comey’s memos show Trump repeatedly asking for his help to "lift the cloud" being cast over his presidency by the Russia probe. Comey writes that he reassured Trump multiple times that the FBI was not investigating him. But Comey’s final memo was written more than a year ago, before Mueller ramped up the investigation and before Trump admitted he had been thinking about the Russia investigation when he fired Comey. More recently, Comey addressed the investigation in his memoir A Higher Loyalty, where he holds open the possibility of criminal wrongdoing: "One of the pivotal questions I presume that Bob Mueller’s team is investigating is whether or not in urging me to back the FBI off our investigation of his national security adviser and in firing me, President Trump was attempting to obstruct justice, which is a federal crime. It’s certainly possible. There is at least circumstantial evidence in that regard, and there may be more that the Mueller team will assemble." Our ruling Trump said the Comey memos "show clearly" that there was no collusion and no obstruction of justice. Nowhere in Comey’s memos does he say that Trump did not collude nor obstruct justice. And in the year since Comey penned his last Trump memo, a special counsel has been appointed who has escalated the investigation. That investigation has resulted in other charges against four members of Trump’s campaign, including three who have agreed to plea deals. In his book, Comey writes that the memos and the circumstances of his firing may be legally relevant to an obstruction case against Trump. Comey has also held open the possibility that Trump may ultimately be found to have committed criminal wrongdoing. We rate this Pants on Fire.

pomt-09230	Louisiana gets "not one single penny" from Gulf Coast offshore oil revenues.	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/may/13/mary-landrieu/landrieu-says-louisiana-doesnt-get-one-single-penn/	In the wake of the BP oil leak disaster, offshore drilling in the Gulf of Mexico has come under intense scrutiny. On May 11, 2010, as Congress held hearings on the incident, Sen. Mary Landrieu, D-La. -- whose state has so far been most directly threatened by the slick -- discussed the issue with MSNBC's Ed Schultz. Landrieu, who has often been an advocate for the energy industry in the Senate, told the liberal talk show host, "I can promise you, no one's going to let the industry skid. We're going to make BP pay. And, I might say, and you know because you've heard me say this before, when will America realize that the Gulf Coast states need revenue-sharing? Do you know how much money the federal treasury gets from this industry every year? An average of $5 billion. Do you know how much money Louisiana gets? Not one single penny." Landrieu's statement was so forceful -- that Louisiana gets "not one single penny" -- that we thought it deserved a fact-check. Before we get to that question, let's first look to see if she was correct about the federal treasury's take. It turns out that Landrieu is basically right. For 2009, the Minerals Management Service -- the office in the Interior Department that collects revenues from energy production -- sent $5.7 billion directly to the federal treasury. But is the Louisiana share of offshore oil royalties really zero, as Landrieu suggested? It's a bit complicated, but the truth is the state makes millions. Here's the breakdown: • For the first 3 miles out from the shoreline, Louisiana -- like other states -- gets to keep 100 percent of any royalties produced by oil and gas drilling. In the most recent year available, 2008, this amounted to $275 million. • Between 3 and 6 miles from the shoreline -- a federally owned band formally known as the 8(g) area -- the federal government sends 27 percent of the royalties to Louisiana. The reasoning is that federal drilling in this area sucks out some of the oil from deposits that span the 3-mile dividing line between state and federal ownership, so these payments are meant to compensate for the lost revenue to states. In 2009, they totaled $22 million and they're estimated to be $32 million this year. • Beyond 6 miles from the shoreline is considered federal territory. For new drilling projects, states get a 37.5 percent share directly to their treasuries and an additional 12.5 percent for state land and water conservation fund projects. The 37.5 percent figure alone amounted to $6.3 million for Louisiana's treasury in 2009, with additional estimated amounts of $558,000 in 2010 and $476,000 in 2011. Existing drilling projects do not currently provide royalties to the states -- a sore point for Louisianans. (More on that later.) And some bonus money that's an indirect result of oil and gas operations off its shores: Louisiana gets a share of the Coastal Impact Assistance Program, a federal program funded by a one-time appropriation of $1 billion distributed between from 2007 to 2010. This money is dispersed to Gulf Coast states, except for Florida, in an amount roughly proportional to the amount of offshore production in federal waters off their shores. Through this program, Louisiana has taken in a share of the $1 billion appropriation. The grand total that Louisiana receives in a typical year is difficult to compute because of big variations in oil prices and other factors, but we feel safe in saying it's in the tens of millions of dollars every year, and depending on how you slice the numbers, possibly hundreds of millions of dollars. Either way, it's not accurate to say that Louisiana received "not one single penny," as Landrieu did. (We ran our findings by both Landrieu's office and by the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee and they agreed that our reporting was accurate.) So what's behind Landrieu's claim? She has long argued that the state gets far less than it deserves from the proceeds of offshore drilling. Before passage of the Gulf of Mexico Energy Security Act of 2006 -- a bill that Landrieu championed -- Louisiana indeed got no financial benefit from federal wells further than 6 miles from its shores. And even that bill didn't go nearly as far as Landrieu wanted. Because only revenues from new projects are included initially, the payments to Louisiana will be relatively modest through 2017 -- a year outside the "budget window," which is a common trick for lawmakers to make bills seem less expensive than they actually are. After that, the payments get quite large, as royalties from existing projects kick in. Louisiana could reap some of an estimated $385 million in 2017 and a share of up to $630 million in later years. Not seeing those big amounts materialize sooner has been a continued source of irritation for many Louisianans, including Landrieu. Reasonable people can disagree over how much Louisiana deserves to receive from drilling off its shores, but even if Landrieu has a point that her state is getting a raw deal over royalties, it is clearly incorrect for her to say that the state gets "not one single penny" from offshore drilling. We rate her statement False.	None	Mary Landrieu	None	None	None	2010-05-13T18:11:48	2010-05-11	['Gulf_Coast_of_the_United_States', 'Louisiana']
pomt-08928	"Ken Buck's (District Attorney's) office? His spending skyrocketed by 40 percent."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/jul/26/jane-norton/ken-bucks-budget-increased-commissioners-said-it-w/	A Republican primary for the U.S. Senate seat in Colorado is heating up with a battle of television ads. Jane Norton recently attacked her opponent over a set of ads being run by Americans for Job Security, a pro-business advocacy group. "Seen those TV ads attacking me? They're paid for by a shady interest group doing the bidding of Ken Buck. You'd think Ken would be man enough to do it himself," Norton says in the ad. "Here's the truth: In state government, I cut budgets, cut programs and reduced staff," Norton continues. "Ken Buck's Office? His spending skyrocketed by 40 percent. We need a senator who's actually cut spending, and has the backbone to stand her ground." Norton is a former lieutenant governor who got early backing from some national Republican Party leaders. Buck is the Weld County District Attorney and a former U.S. attorney and has received backing from the tea party movement. Here, we'll look at Norton's statement about Ken Buck that spending at his office "skyrocketed by 40 percent." We've also fact-checked the ad that Norton was responding to and explained more about the group Americans for Job Security. We contacted Norton's office to ask for back-up for her statement about Buck's office, but they didn't get back to us. The Weld County Commission, though, said the District Attorney's budget increased by 30 percent during Buck's tenure, not as much as Norton's ad said. From 2005 to 2009, the budget increased from $3.4 million to $4.4 million, they said. (Buck was elected in November 2004; Weld County is northwest of Denver.) We wanted to double-check their numbers, so we reviewed budget documents from Weld County. We found there are a number of ways to look at the budget, depending on whether you include budgets for special programs in different years. (A victim's assistance program is one example.) We looked at the base budgets, though, and found that the 2005 budget was closer to $3.2 million. The difference between $3.2 million and $3.4 million isn't much, but it's enough to push the percentage growth from 30 percent to 38 percent. Whatever the number, the commission defended the increase in a formal letter signed by all five commissioners. They noted that the budget grew along with the population of the county and as the number of its courts in Weld County increased as well. Crime, meanwhile, decreased. "The Weld County Commissioners are impressed with the return on investment we have made in our District Attorney's Office and would not approve budget increases if we didn't believe it was to the benefit of our county," they said. The commissioners noted that the population increased 40 percent between 2000 and 2009. However, we calculated the population change from 2005 to 2009, the time period in question, and found the population increased 12 percent. We will stipulate that there are several different ways to look at the District Attorney's office budget, but whichever way you look at it, the budget increased somewhere between 30 and 40 percent, which is pretty close to Norton's claim. On the other hand, the Weld County Commission defended the increase as appropriate and a good use of resources, an important idea for voters to consider. So we rate Norton's statement Mostly True.

pomt-12920	Says Georgia’s 5th congressional district, represented by John Lewis, is "in horrible shape and falling apart (not to mention crime infested)."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2017/jan/15/donald-trump/trumps-john-lewis-crime-invested-atlanta/	President-elect Donald Trump kicked off Martin Luther King Jr. weekend by sparring with Democratic Georgia Rep. John Lewis, after the civil rights icon said he doesn’t see Trump as a "legitimate president." Lewis, in an interview with NBC, said he wouldn’t attend the presidential inauguration because he thought the Russians had helped Trump win election. A few hours later, Trump hit back on Twitter, saying the place Lewis represents is "crime infested." As many have noted, Lewis has had a long record of action, including dozens of arrests dozens for protesting segregation, enduring violence at the hands of state troopers and leading the fight for racial justice in the 1960s. But is Trump right that Lewis’ district today isn’t doing so hot? A transition team spokesman referred us to the district’s unemployment, poverty and crime rates. They are higher than the national and state averages, but the district is doing well . Calling it "crime infested" is a stretch. Georgia’s 5th congressional district, which Lewis has represented since 1987, consists of most of Atlanta (Fulton county) as well as parts of the surrounding suburbs (DeKalb and Clayton counties). Here’s a map: To get a sense of how Georgia’s 5th is doing, we looked at the Census Bureau’s My Congressional District service, which compiles federal demographic and socioeconomic data. Georgia’s 5th State average National average Unemployment rate (2015) 8.2 percent 5.5 percent 5.0 percent Median household income (2015) $48,017 $49.620 $53,889 Poverty rate (2015) 21.3 percent 17.0 percent 13.5 percent Percent with high school degree (2015) 87.6 percent 85.4 percent 86.7 percent Percent with bachelor's degree 40.6 percent 28.8 percent 29.8 percent As you can see, the district has higher unemployment and poverty rates than the national and state averages and a lower median income. On the flip side, it also has a higher rate of education attainment. Atlanta, the heart of the district, is a major international transportation hub and one of the fastest growing places in the country. Forbes named the city the ninth best place in America for businesses and career development, and among the best for job growth and education. The Brookings Institution’s Metro Monitor report — which measures economic trends in 100 U.S. cities like job and wage growth, poverty and gross metropolitan product — placed Atlanta at No. 32 for growth (though it ranked at No. 62 and 63 for prosperity and inclusion, respectively) in its January 2016 report. A separate analysis by PNC Financial Services noted Atlanta’s "tech and corporate cluster" and its "economic dynamism." (A number of Atlanta companies, including Coca Cola and Delta Air Lines, made the Fortune 500 in 2016). Longer term, the financial analysts concluded, the city will be "an above-average performer." In sum, Trump is exaggerating when he says Georgia’s 5th is "falling apart" by some metrics and, by others, he’s flat-out wrong. What about his parenthetical swipe at the dangers of living in Lewis’ district? Crime is not reported by congressional district so we’ll have to look at the Georgia 5th’s constituent parts. As the Trump transition team accurately noted, Atlanta had the 14th-highest violent crime rate in 2015 with 1,120 violent crimes per 100,000 residents. That’s about triple the national average: 372.6 offenses per 100,000. (We should note the FBI cautions against ranking and comparing crime rates across cities.) But that ignores the fact that Atlanta’s violent crime rate, as well as property, has been decreasing over the past decade, mirroring the overall national trend. Here are two charts showing that: See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com While Atlanta does make up most of the Georgia’s 5th, the district does contain parts of other towns with lower crime rates. For example, Brookhaven in the northern tip had a violent crime rate of 327.9 in 2015, and Morrow in the southern end 574.6, according to FBI statistics. Residents of Lewis’ district did not agree with Trump’s depiction of their neighborhood, and rallied to defend it on social media. The Atlanta Journal Constitution highlighted the reactions on its front page Sunday morning, emblazoned with the headline: "Atlanta to Trump: ‘Wrong.’ " And in 2007, when Trump was looking to add his name the city’s skyline, he seemed to have a very different opinion of it, according to a 2015 Journal Constitution article. "Atlanta is one of those cities that won’t be suffering the real estate foibles. Atlanta is like New York. New York is as hot as it ever has been," Trump said. "It’s just going to get better." (That year, the violent crime rate was 1623.8, about 45 percent higher than it was in 2015.) A day after his initial tweets, Trump broadened his claim and said Lewis should focus on "crime-infested inner cities of the U.S." Our ruling Trump said Georgia’s 5th congressional district is "in horrible shape and falling apart (not to mention crime infested)." The district isn’t in as terrible economic shape as Trump suggests. While it has higher unemployment and poverty rates than the national average, it still has a thriving economic hub in Atlanta and higher educational attainment. Atlanta does have a much higher crime rate than the national average, but like most major cities, that has been in decline. We rate Trump’s claim Mostly False.

pomt-04906	Says U.S. Senate opponent Eric Hovde "supported billions in stimulus for high-speed rail" and "billions more to bail out banks."	half-true	/wisconsin/statements/2012/aug/03/mark-neumann/fellow-gop-senate-candidate-eric-hovde-backed-bill/	According to polls, support for Wisconsin U.S. Senate candidate Eric Hovde is strongest among tea party supporters and the most conservative voters. Yet, in a July 17, 2012 TV ad, there’s a smiling Hovde, a Republican, pictured alongside a smiling President Barack Obama. The ad is from fellow GOP candidate Mark Neumann, who has stepped up his attacks on Hovde as the Aug. 14, 2012 primary approaches. "Like Barack Obama," the ad says, "Hovde supported billions in stimulus for high-speed rail and, like Obama, billions more to bail out banks." It ends stating that Hovde is "too liberal" with "your money." With the comparison to Obama -- whose policies Hovde has sharply criticized -- Neumann tries to portray Hovde as a backer of big government. Let’s see just how much support Hovde voiced for spending billions for high-speed trains and to bail out troubled banks. High-speed rail To back the high-speed rail part of Neumann’s claim, Neumann campaign manager Chip Englander cited the November 2008 edition of Hovde Industry Update, a newsletter published by one of Hovde’s financial services companies. The publication date is important in understanding the context of what the newsletter says. Even before Obama took office in January 2009, he was working with Democratic congressional leaders on an economic stimulus plan. What emerged, in February 2009, was a nearly $790 billion bill that included $282 billion in tax relief and $507 billion in spending, with about $48 billion for the Department of Transportation. (The estimate of the bill’s total cost has since been raised to $840 billion.) The newsletter -- all eight pages were devoted to one article -- was headlined: "Welcome to the government spending bubble." But far from welcoming government spending, the newsletter’s first paragraph ends with a warning: "At the core of these problems" in the U.S. financial system "is the toxic mix of Wall Street and Washington, which first led to the Internet bubble, then to the credit and housing bubble, and now to what may become a governmental spending bubble at the worst possible time." The newsletter goes on at length to criticize actions by the Federal Reserve Board and the U.S. Treasury in banking. Then it turns to the stimulus, saying the stimulus "needs to achieve the maximum effect and to address the root causes of this (financial) crisis." High-speed rail comes into play when the newsletter suggests stimulus money should be focused on "targeted federal infrastructure projects": "Again, building high-speed, light rail systems on the East and West coasts would stimulate job creation, increase productivity for those people and companies that transact business up and down the coastlines, and vastly reduce fuel consumption, as more people opt to use mass transit rather than drive their own automobile. Obviously, achieving a material reduction in oil demand would help attack this country’s single greatest cause of our massive trade and capital account deficits. Lastly, these programs would provide tangible, long-lasting benefits to society." Hovde doesn’t mention spending billions, but it’s easy to see that even a single high-speed rail project on either coast could cost that much. The proposed Milwaukee-to-Madison high-speed line spurned by Gov. Scott Walker had been slated for $810 million in federal funds. And the $48 billion in stimulus received by the federal DOT included $8 billion for high-speed and "inter-city rail programs." When we asked for a response from Hovde, his campaign spokesman, Sean Lansing, cited a July 2012 interview Hovde did with a Green Bay TV station. Hovde said the claim that he supported billions for spending for high-speed rail was "totally false." But then he acknowledged his newsletter did say that "during the height of the financial crisis, if we feel it necessary to spend money on stimulus," the money could be spent on high-speed rail on the coasts. We also found that in a March 2009 interview with CNBC-TV’s "Squawk Box" program, Hovde noted that he had previously advocated for spending stimulus money on high-speed rail. So, at a point when it was clear there would be a stimulus bill, Hovde supported spending stimulus money on high-speed rail, which likely would involve billions of dollars. But Neumann’s ad leaves out vital context from the newsletter: That Hovde opposed the stimulus money. He was arguing if there were a stimulus, it should be spent on projects that make an impact, such as high-speed rail on the East Coast. The ad also skips past the fact that these comments were made before Hovde was a candidate, presenting them as if he is an unabashed booster of spending as part of his campaign. Bank bailouts To back the part of the claim that Hovde supported billions "to bail out banks," Englander cited a clip from a TV appearance in which Hovde says: "Without question, I was an advocate from the get-go to inject capital into the banking system." This has some similar problems. The clip comes from an earlier interview Hovde did on "Squawk Box," in November 2008, about TARP, the Troubled Asset Relief Program. It was signed into law the previous month by President George W. Bush. Criticized by some Republicans as a bailout, the law authorized the U.S. Treasury to spend up to $700 billion to stabilize financial markets. Hovde criticized TARP for several minutes, though he said "something needed to be done." Then one of the hosts asked him: "Didn’t the government do something right by preventing the financial market from collapsing, by preventing the banking system from collapsing at some point?" Hovde replied with the part of the quote that Neumann cites, then said more: "Without question, I was an advocate from the get-go to inject capital into the banking system. But you should've done it on terms that were a little bit more punitive and required them to access private capital along with it, as well as putting the government's money -- taxpayer money -- in the most senior position." He added: "If they would have structured it properly and forced the banks to go to the private sector, there was a lot of private sector money that, on the right terms, would have come in. And, yes, we needed to stabilize the system." In response, Hovde spokesman Lansing again cited the July 2012 Green Bay TV interview. Asked if he supported billions to bail out banks, Hovde said: "I have been opposed to that from Day One." He said he had written and given interviews in 2008 asserting that, "if we needed to give money to these companies, then executives should have been replaced and the cost of the capital should have been higher." Like the high-speed rail part of Neumann’s claim, Neumann’s ad takes a partial statement and ignores critical context. It further muddies things by comparing Hovde to Obama, when the TARP proposal in question was done under Bush. On the other hand, Neumann’s ad didn’t say Hovde supported TARP but rather that he supported billions to bail out banks. Hovde did express support for a taxpayer-funded bailout, albeit with an approach he asserted would better protect taxpayers. Our rating Neumann compared Hovde to Obama, saying Hovde "supported billions in stimulus for high-speed rail" and "billions more to bail out banks." Hovde was critical of the stimulus plan, but did back high-speed rail as a spending option when it was clear the stimulus program would be created. Similarly, Hovde didn’t back TARP, as the ad implies, but did favor taxpayer assistance provided in a different way. Neumann’s claim is partially accurate, but takes Hovde’s statements out of context -- our definition of Half True.

An outfit called Stranger Than Fiction News posted a video on its Facebook page Oct. 25. Over footage of a group of masked protestors burning an American flag, the post has the bold news headline "‘MAGA bomber’ identified as former CNN employee who donated to heavily to Hillary Clinton." (The video matches an antifa flag burning in Portland, Ore.) The video had over 30,000 views, and if the comments are any guide, it reached a receptive audience. Comments included "The Democratic Party is a terrorist organization," and "The fake pipe bomb fiasco that has gripped America for the last two days is rapidly unraveling as a political hoax." A couple of people asked "Is this for real?" To which we say, no. This is pure, 100 percent certified fake news. The FBI’s latest statement (as of the time we published) says only that an 11th package was recovered in Florida, addressed to Sen. Cory Booker, D-N.J. There’s been no announcement of any suspects, much less a person with ties to CNN or the campaign of Hillary Clinton.

pomt-08882	Says President Barack Obama initially said the national health-care mandate isn't a tax, but his administration now says it is a tax.	mostly true	/texas/statements/2010/aug/02/republican-party-texas/republican-party-texas-says-president-barack-obama/	Channeling U.S. Rep Joe Wilson, the Republican from South Carolina who shouted "You lie!" during President Barack Obama's speech to Congress in September, the Republican Party of Texas has accused the president of lying when he said that a new federal mandate requiring individuals to have health insurance was not a tax. "You lie!" the party tweeted July 19. "Obama said O-care mandate wasn't a tax. Now Obama admin says it is a tax." Did the Obama administration talk one way and then the other? Per the legislation that Obama signed into law in March, most people will be required to have health insurance starting in 2014. There are exceptions, but individuals who aren't exempt and refuse to join a plan will be required to pay an annual penalty of $695 per person, up to a maximum of $2,085 per family, or 2.5 percent of household income, whichever is greater. The health care law calls the fine individuals must pay if they don't have insurance a "penalty." In a Sept. 20, 2009, interview with ABC's George Stephanopoulos, Obama denied that the mandate to buy health insurance was equivalent to a tax. "For us to say that you've got to take a responsibility to get health insurance is absolutely not a tax increase," Obama said. He noted that Americans are required to have auto insurance, but nobody considers that a tax increase. (Auto insurance is a state mandate, but all the states except New Hampshire require it of resident drivers.) When Stephanopoulos pressed Obama on whether the mandate was a tax, Obama said: "I absolutely reject that notion." However, on July 16 The New York Times published a story that seemed to vindicate opponents of the health care overhaul who argued that the insurance requirement was a tax. The headline: "Changing stance, administration now defends insurance mandate as a tax." Texas is one of 21 states challenging the law's constitutionality in court, but Virginia was the first to face the federal government in a July 1 hearing on its lawsuit. The New York Times pointed to a brief filed in that case by the U.S. Department of Justice defending the individual mandate as "a valid exercise" of the federal government's "power to lay and collect taxes." Congress can impose taxes to provide for the "general welfare" under Article I of the Constitution. From the health-care law: "The requirement regulates activity that is commercial and economic in nature: economic and financial decisions about how and when health care is paid for, and when health insurance is purchased." The law then says that national health spending is projected to increase from $2.5 trillion — 17.6 percent of the economy — in 2009, to $4.7 trillion in 2019. In its legal brief, the department says the penalty is also a tax because it will raise revenue — $4 billion a year by 2017, according to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office — and because it's imposed and collected under the Internal Revenue Code. Individuals who refuse to obtain health insurance and are penalized will have to report the fine "as an addition to income tax liability," the brief says. The health care law itself doesn't mention Congress' taxing authority, instead noting that the mandate is protected under the Constitution's Article I "commerce clause," which lets Congress regulate commercial activity that has a substantial effect on the national economy. "The tax argument is the strongest argument," the Times quoted Jack Balkin, a professor at Yale Law School who supports the law, saying. "This bill is a tax. Because it's a tax, it's completely constitutional." Balkin is also quoted saying that Obama "has not been honest with the American people about the nature of the bill." White House spokesman Matt Lehrich defended the law both ways last week, telling us: "We believe that the Commerce Clause provides ample constitutional authority for the individual mandate. If anyone has any doubts about that — and we don’t think they should — it’s also clear that that the mandate is constitutional under Congress’s power to tax." Similarly, Steven Schwinn, an associate professor of constitutional law at the John Marshall Law School in Chicago, pointed out on his blog July 18 that the Obama administration has consistently defended the mandate in court primarily under the Commerce Clause, and secondarily under Congress' taxing power to promote the general welfare. Henry Aaron, a scholar who specializes in health care and tax policy at the liberal-leaning Brookings Institution, said Obama was correct to say the mandate isn't a tax. "A mandate is meaningless unless it is backed up by some 'or else,' as in 'obey the mandate or else,' " Aaron said. "The administration asserted the legal power to impose a mandate. The mandate is backed up by a tax that has to be paid if the mandate is violated. You obey the mandate or you pay the tax." Upshot: In his interview with Stephanopoulos, Obama insisted the mandate to purchase health coverage is not a tax. But in defending its legality, the Justice Department argues in part that the mandate is a valid exercise of Congress' taxing power. From where we sit, Obama was trying to make a political point; the Justice Department, a legal one. In its tweet, the Republican Party overreaches when it says the administration now calls the mandate a tax. The administration (still) isn't doing that. But it does cite Congress' power to levy taxes as authority for the mandate. And that enables the GOP to score its own political point, based on what looks like the administration's runs at having it both ways. We rate the GOP's recap of Obama's early position and his administration's recent defense of the law as Mostly True.

pomt-01503	Jason Carter "actually opposed more funding for education in the Senate."	mostly true	/georgia/statements/2014/sep/24/republican-governors-association/attack-mostly-target-carter-opposed-education-fund/	The too-close-to-call race between Republican incumbent Nathan Deal and Democratic challenger Jason Carter has the Republican Governors Association plunking down more money in Georgia. The RGA has already spent $1.6 million on Georgia’s governor’s race and is upping its investment with a new ad that started airing Tuesday in most parts of the state. The association has previously taken to the airwaves in Georgia to attack Carter, a state senator from Atlanta, as a "liberal trial lawyer" and a champion of expanding Medicaid as part of Obamacare. The new 30-second challenges one of Carter’s biggest campaign promises -- his vow to improve education funding. "Jason Carter promises to invest more in education. But Carter actually opposed more funding for education in the Senate," the ad states. That’s a frequent claim out of the Deal campaign. It’s also very similar to a claim that PolitiFact has examined previously and deems worthy of a second look -- given that education is one of the hottest topics in the race and one of taxpayers’ biggest investment. (This year alone, the cost of K-12 education is $7.9 billion, or 43.4 percent of the state’s $18.3 billion budget.) The ad from the Republican Governors Association specifically takes aim at Carter’s vote in the most recent General Assembly session on the 2015 state budget (though the RGA gives a wrong citation in the ad for HB 744, the 2015 appropriations bill). Out of 56 state senators, Carter was one of only four who voted "No" on the budget," state records show. The budget included austerity cuts to education, totaling $747 million. But they were the smallest cuts since 2009 and, as such, were viewed by leaders in education as largely positive. This past spring, when Deal signed the 2015 budget into law, Carter explained his opposition was rooted in a belief that having a separate education budget would restore all, not just some, of the previous cuts. "Budgets reflect values, and this budget shows that Gov. Deal does not value our students, teachers and classrooms," Carter said in a statement in April. Carter has since expanded on his idea of a separate education budget, including a questionable funding stream from tax cheats to boost spending. Republicans argued that Deal increased education funding every year, a claim PolitiFact found overstated his record. On the campaign trail, Carter has repeatedly attacked Deal for underfunding education. Most of his public statements as a state senator focused on education and called for more money, both on the K-12 and college levels. "To say he does not support more funding is completely erroneous," Carter spokesman Bryan Thomas said. "It’s precisely the opposite. He does not want our schools to continue to be shortchanged." Republicans, however, have suggested that Carter’s vote against the 2015 budget was strictly political posturing. They point out that he voted in favor of Deal’s three prior state budgets, all of which had larger education austerity cuts. (Georgia’s 180 school systems collectively were underfunded more than $1.1 billion in 2012, $1.1 billion in 2013 and nearly $1.1 billion in 2014, according to allotment sheets from the Georgia Department of Education.) Austerity cuts reflect the difference in what school systems qualify for and actually receive from the state under the education funding formula, the Quality Basic Education Act of 1985. Carter has voiced concerns about the state’s commitment to public education during his short Senate career. His criticism, specifically of Deal on education, has sharpened in recent months, with his campaign manager at one point calling Deal Georgia’s worst education governor. (See PolitiFact’s Pants On Fire ruling of that claim.) Around the nation, there are 36 governor’s races this fall and about a third of them -- including the one between Deal and Carter -- are considered competitive, said Larry Sabato, director of the University of Virginia Center for Politics. "Deal is one of five incumbent Republicans who is in some degree of difficulty," Sabato said. "Deal is a slight favorite, but Carter has kept it close." In summary, the RGA ad claims that Carter "actually opposed more funding for education." It would be accurate to say Carter voted against the current state budget that expanded money for schools. Carter has called for more education funding for nearly all of his short political career. But when it came down to votes in the state Senate, he voted with Gov. Deal on three budgets that contained austerity cuts and against the governor on a budget that had the smallest austerity cuts in years. The GOP was careful in wording its latest ad to say Carter opposed more funding for education "in the Senate." That statement needs that context but is largely on target.

pomt-12491	Says of the GOP health care proposal, "pre-existing conditions are in the bill."	mostly false	/florida/statements/2017/may/01/donald-trump/does-new-version-ahca-still-cover-pre-existing-con/	President Donald Trump remains hopeful that he can deliver on his promise to repeal the Affordable Care Act and replace it with a plan from the Republican Party. In an interview with CBS’ Face the Nation, Trump argued that the GOP’s health care plan covers pre-existing conditions, despite what news reports have said. "Pre-existing conditions are in the bill," Trump said April 30. "And I just watched another network than yours, and they were saying, ‘Pre-existing is not covered.’ Pre-existing conditions are in the bill. And I mandate it. I said, ‘Has to be.’ " Trump was more than likely referring to the most recent version of the GOP health care overhaul, an amendment by U.S. Rep. Tom MacArthur, R-N.J., introduced in late April. "This bill is much different than it was a little while ago, okay? This bill has evolved," Trump said. "But we have now pre-existing conditions in the bill. We've set up a pool for the pre-existing conditions so that the premiums can be allowed to fall." When CBS’ John Dickerson pressed Trump on whether everyone with pre-existing conditions would be covered, Trump said, "We actually have a clause that guarantees." White House spokesman Sean Spicer said at the May 1 news briefing that Trump was referring to the MacArthur amendment and that Trump is ensuring that "coverage of pre-existing conditions is at the core" of the legislation. But the reality of how the bill addresses pre-existing conditions -- which are health problems patients have before new insurance kicks in -- is much more complicated than Trump makes it sound. What the amendment says on pre-existing conditions In March, the Republican’s American Health Care Act died without a vote when Republicans couldn’t agree on the bill designed to replace the Affordable Care Act. Under the new bill, called ACHA, insurers had to cover pre-existing conditions, but they could have charged more for people who are recently uninsured. The MacArthur amendment would allow states to obtain waivers to some requirements of the Affordable Care Act, including the "essential health benefits" provision that requires maternity care or mental health services. The amendment has language that appears to protect those with pre-existing conditions stating that "nothing in this Act shall be construed as permitting insurers to limit access to health coverage for individuals with pre-existing conditions." But experts say other parts of the amendment suggest that those with pre-existing conditions could struggle to maintain affordable health insurance. The amendment permits insurers to set premiums based on the "health status" of an individual by looking at their current and past health status and make predictions about how much an individual will use medical care in the future, said Linda Blumberg, senior fellow in the Health Policy Center at the Urban Institute. That’s where pre-existing conditions could come into play, because it would mean that the costs rise for consumers who are sicker, said Timothy Jost, Washington and Lee University School of Law emeritus professor. "Health status underwriting is literally charging a higher (possibly much, unaffordably, higher) premium to people with pre-existing conditions," Jost said. "Under the MacArthur amendment, they could not be refused coverage, but insurers could impose high enough premiums that coverage would be unaffordable." The amendment says that the waiver would allow states to set up a high-risk pool or participate in a new federal invisible risk-sharing program to help states reimburse insurers for covering high-risk consumers. "No state may obtain a waiver for health status unless it has taken these efforts to protect those who might be affected," stated a MacArthur press release. "In states with a waiver, individuals who maintain continuous coverage could not be rated based on health status." That means people who stay insured without any lapses can’t be charged more by insurance companies if they get sick. But experts said that many low-income people aren’t able to stay covered without breaks, and that questions remain about the effectiveness of the high-risk pools. The American Medical Association, which opposes the amendment, said in a statement that it "could make coverage unaffordable for people with pre-existing conditions." The AMA raised questions about whether the high-risk pool would be "sufficient to provide for affordable health insurance or prevent discrimination against individuals with certain high-cost medical conditions." Our ruling Trump said of the GOP health care amendment, "Pre-existing conditions are in the bill." The amendment says that health insurers can’t limit access to coverage for people with pre-existing conditions, but that insurers can charge people more if states agree. In some states, health insurers would be able to charge sicker people more. And experts warn that high-risk pools -- the mechanisms meant to keep premiums lower for sick people -- might not be effective. Overall, the latest proposal seems to weaken existing protections for people with pre-existing conditions, not strengthen them. We rate the statement Mostly False.

pomt-08370	"More private-sector jobs were created in the first eight months of 2010 than in the eight years of the Bush administration."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/oct/25/nancy-pelosi/nancy-pelosi-says-more-private-sector-jobs-created/	House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif. -- who is in danger of losing her leadership position if the Republicans take over the House -- must really like the following talking point, because she's used it at least twice on national television in recent days. "More private-sector jobs were created in the first eight months of 2010 than in the eight years of the Bush administration," she said in an interview on MSNBC's Countdown with Keith Olbermann on Oct. 21, 2010. The day before, Pelosi said something virtually identical in an interview on PBS' Charlie Rose Show. We thought we'd check to see if she's correct. We turned to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the federal agency that tracks employment numbers. According to the BLS website, there were 111,634,000 Americans employed in the private sector at the start of George W. Bush's first term, in January 2001. Eight years later, in January 2009, there were 110,961,000 Americans employed in the private sector. So the United States lost 673,000 private-sector jobs on Bush's watch. That makes it easy for Pelosi: If the United States netted even one private-sector job in 2010, she'd be accurate. And the nation actually did quite a bit better than that. Private-sector employment in January 2010 was 107,123,000, a number that grew to 107,970,000 by Septmeber 2010. That works out to be 847,000 jobs created. So Pelosi's statement is accurate. But it's also a classic case of cherry-picking -- for two reasons. First, Pelosi carefully cited private-sector employment, not total employment. There's a valid reason to focus on private-sector jobs rather than government jobs, since private-sector jobs produce income-boosting goods and services to a degree that government jobs do not. Still, choosing private-sector jobs helps Pelosi's case in a crucial way: If she'd chosen total employment instead, her formulation would have been wrong. Total employment -- that is, the combination of private- and public-sector jobs -- during Bush's tenure increased by 1.08 million, while total employment in 2010 has increased by 599,000. (Quick aside: Who would have thought that federal and state government jobs would have increased by 1.7 million in eight years under Bush and fallen by 357,000 since President Barack Obama took office?) Second, Pelosi chose her start and end dates in a way that's highly favorable to Obama and unfavorable to Bush. If she'd instead chosen to start from the beginning of Obama's term -- rather than half way through his first two years -- she would be stuck with a net loss of nearly 3 million private-sector jobs, not the increase of 847,000 she came up with for 2010. Pelosi essentially started counting from the low point for jobs and only counted the upward part of the trendline. Meanwhile, the start and end points she used for Bush give the former president no such break. The jobs picture under Bush looked like an arc, heading generally upward through mid 2007 before heading downward again. If she had used only the upward portion of the arc, as she did for Obama, it would have showed a gain of 3.9 million private-sector jobs. You could argue that it's unfair to pin the blame on Obama for job losses early in his tenure. Still, Pelosi drew the lines for her comparison as artfully as state legislatures have been known to draw lines defining congressional districts, and, similarly, Pelosi's choices are not just highly selective but also beneficial to her side. To be fair, Pelosi's staff points out that they have not shied from showing the full arc of the jobs numbers since Obama took office, attaching a fact sheet showing both the decline and rise in jobs since Obama's inauguration. But her televised comments don't reflect that. To fully understand the jobs comparison Pelosi makes, you need to understand how she sliced and diced the numbers. It's a good example of a statement that is accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of context. -- the Truth-O-Meter's definition of Half True. So we rate it Half True.

pomt-07783	If Wisconsin's governor cuts perquisites as much as he plans to do, "it would still leave (workers) better off than their private sector" counterparts.	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/feb/21/george-will/george-will-says-wisconsin-governors-benefits-prop/	With national attention focused on a showdown in Wisconsin over Gov. Scott Walker's proposal to reduce state worker benefits, the issue led to some spirited back-and-forth between union-backer Donna Brazile and conservative columnist George Will during the round-table discussion on ABC's This Week. Brazile called the workers who have flooded the state capitol to back union workers an "organic movement." "Just like the Tea Party went out there and grabbed the microphone, what you have is grassroots people out there saying, 'No more,' no more budget cuts on the back of working people." Brazile said. Will responded, "Donna, what you call the grassroots is a tiny minority of this tiny minority of Wisconsin people who work for the government. Three hundred thousand public employees in Wisconsin went to work -- while the teachers were clutching their little signs that say it's all about the kids, they're abandoning their classrooms, lying to their supervisors, saying they were sick, and going off to protest in defense of perquisites, which if the governor cuts them as much as he plans to do, would still leave them better off than their private sector" counterparts. We decided to check Will's claim that perks or non-wage compensation such as health and retirement benefits) -- if cut as much as Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker has proposed -- would still leave public employees "better off" than those in the private sector. Walker's plan would require state workers to pay 5.8 percent of their pension contributions and to double their share of health premiums to 12.6 percent. Our colleagues at PolitiFact Wisconsin have been all over many of the issues in this contentious debate, and back on Feb. 8, they fact-checked a claim Gov. Walker made in his first "state of the state" address, that most state employees could pay twice as much toward their health care premiums, and it would still be half the national average. Here's some of what our friends at PolitiFact Wisconsin found: * A Kaiser Family Foundation study that concluded that employees nationally -- public and private -- pay an average of 29 percent of the cost of the premiums. Among just state and government workers nationwide, the average was 25 percent for family coverage. * A U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics 2010 health care benefits survey that put the employee share at 32 percent for family coverage. It’s 21 percent for single coverage. * A study by The Segal Co., a private benefits firm, that looked just at state government workers and found that a majority pay between 20 percent and 60 percent of their premium costs for family coverage. In other words, no matter how you slice it, the 12.6 percent share of health care premiums that Walker proposes employees pay is well below what most pay in the private -- and public -- sectors. That gets us halfway there. The second piece is pensions. Again, Walker's plan would require state workers to pay 5.8 percent of pension contributions. This one is a little more difficult to compare. Most public employees have a pension plan. But fewer than one in five private-sector employees has access to a pension plan. And those who do typically don't contribute anything to it. Much more often, private employees have access to employer-sponsored retirement benefits (such as 401(k) plans), rather than pensions. And a third of the private sector workforce has no access to an employer sponsored retirement plan at all. "The 401(k) has become the de facto retirement benefit in the private sector," said Keith Brainard, research director for the National Association of State Retirement Administrators. Typically, Brainard said, employers will match about 3 percent to 5 percent of an employee's salary. Employees may contribute to their 401(k), but they aren't required to contribute. So Wisconsin public employees may be required to contribute more to the their retirement plan than those in the private sector, but that doesn't mean they're at a disadvantage compared to the private sector. In fact, experts say they will be better off. According to a survey prepared by Brainard in October 2009, "The retirement security of working Americans presently appears shaky outside the public sector, due not only to the nation’s heavy use of a retirement plan model that has been found to be undependable in its ability to provide reliable retirement income, but also due to low relative rates of participation in employer-sponsored retirement plans. " Conversely, "For most states and local governments, retirement security of retired workers is a policy that is being achieved." As always, Brainard said, there are exceptions, such as for those government employees who don't work long enough to become vested in a pension. But Will's comment, as it relates to pension is "largely accurate," Brainard said. "Overall, the retirement plan typically provided to Wisconsin public employees --whether or not they are contributing 5.8 percent -- provides a larger retirement benefit than private sector employees get." We'd like to cite one more survey, one by the Wisconsin Legislative Council which found that even among major public employee retirement systems, most required employee contributions of more than 5 percent. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, "for government workers with a required plan contribution, the average contribution is 6.3 percent of earnings." So Walker's proposal is in line with the norm for government workers. Now, we'd like to drop one big disclaimer into this whole analysis. Many experts contend that while state workers get better benefits, they get paid less than folks in the private sector. PolitiFact Wisconsin took a closer look at that issue here. The point is that it's important to consider an employee's total package of wages and benefits when comparing public and private sector compensation. But that's not the issue before us here. Will clearly stated that he was talking about just the benefits side of the equation. And with regard to the changes Walker has proposed -- requiring greater employee contributions to pension and health care -- Will is right that they would still leave public employees "better off" than those in the private sector. We rate Will's comment True.	None	George Will	None	None	None	2011-02-21T18:55:11	2011-02-20	['Wisconsin']
pomt-10241	On support for the Bridge to Nowhere.	full flop	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/sep/01/sarah-palin/as-candidate-yes-as-governor-no/	Shortly after being introduced as Sen. John McCain's vice presidential running mate, Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin sought to bolster her credibility as a crusader against wasteful spending, saying, "I told Congress, 'Thanks, but no thanks,' on that bridge to nowhere." We ruled that statement only Half True. Yes, we noted, Palin formally nixed plans for a nearly $400-million Alaska bridge project to connect the tiny city of Ketchikan to Gravina, an island with just a few dozen residents and an airport. The project was derisively nicknamed the Bridge to Nowhere by a government watchdog group and became a national symbol of federal pork-barrel spending. Long before Palin killed the project, Congress washed its hands of the bridge. In the transportation spending bill that included money for the Ketchikan bridge, Congress deleted the wording that would have directed money for the project, though it left the money in place so Alaska officials could decide which transportation projects to spend it on. As a result, Alaska diverted much of the $223-million from the federal government to other projects, leaving the Ketchikan-Gravina bridge project woefully underfunded, and with no prospect of additional federal funding. That was the point at which Palin formally killed the bridge project. Several of our readers wrote to us saying we were too generous with our ruling, that Palin had flip-flopped on the issue, at one time supporting the bridge before later opposing it. We think that's a separate matter, and so we'll address it here. While running for governor in September 2006, Palin assured the Ketchikan Chamber of Commerce she was all for the bridge. "The money that's been appropriated for the project, it should remain available for a link, an access process as we continue to evaluate the scope and just how best to just get this done," Palin said then, according to a story in the Ketchikan Daily News . "This link is a commitment to help Ketchikan expand its access, to help this community prosper." "I think we're going to make a good team as we progress that bridge project," she told the audience. And in a written questionnaire for the Anchorage Daily News the following month, October of 2006, Palin was asked directly, "Would you continue state funding for the proposed Knik Arm and Gravina Island bridges?" Her answer: "Yes. I would like to see Alaska's infrastructure projects built sooner rather than later. The window is now — while our congressional delegation is in a strong position to assist." Palin's position began to shift once she became governor, however. Palin took over as governor in December 2006 and in February 2007 her proposed state budget didn't include state funding for the Ketchikan bridge. A spokesman noted that Palin's proposed capital budget focused on projects that could draw federal money, too. At that point, according to the Ketchikan Daily News , the cost of the bridge had risen $67-million and former Gov. Frank Murkowski had recommended putting $195-million in the state budget for Ketchikan's bridge. In defending the change of position this week, Palin campaign spokeswoman Maria Comella said Palin "acted like a responsible and effective executive. After taking office and examining the project closely, she consistently opposed funding the 'Bridge to Nowhere' and ultimately canceled the wasteful project." It's true that on Sept. 21, 2007, Palin officially killed the project. "Ketchikan desires a better way to reach the airport, but the $398-million bridge is not the answer," Palin said in a prepared statement. "Despite the work of our congressional delegation, we are about $329-million short of full funding for the bridge project, and it's clear that Congress has little interest in spending any more money on a bridge between Ketchikan and Gravina Island." But she wasn't sounding like someone who opposed the project as wasteful either. "Much of the public's attitude toward Alaska bridges is based on inaccurate portrayals of the projects here," Palin said. "But we need to focus on what we can do, rather than fight over what has happened." So the question here is whether Palin flipped positions on the project, or conceded to the political reality that opposition had become too strong against it. Without further support from Congress, Alaska would have had to shoulder most of the cost itself. Palin's quotes about the project this week seem to suggest she opposed the project. "I've championed reform to end the abuses of earmarked spending by Congress," Palin said at a joint appearance with McCain in Washington, Pa., on Aug. 30. "And I did tell Congress, thanks but no thanks for that bridge to nowhere. If our state wanted to build a bridge, we were going to build it ourselves." McCain said Palin has "stopped government from wasting taxpayers' money on things they don't want or need. And when we in Congress decided to build a bridge in Alaska to nowhere for $233-million of yours, she said, we don't want it. If we need it, we'll build our own in Alaska. She's the one that stood up to them." Nevermind that Alaska didn't give the money back. It spent the money on other transportation projects. The context of Palin's and McCain's recent statements suggest Palin flagged the so-called Bridge to Nowhere project as wasteful spending. But that's not the tune she was singing when she was running for governor, particularly not when she was standing before the Ketchikan Chamber of Commerce asking for their vote. And so, we rate Palin's position a Full Flop.	None	Sarah Palin	None	None	None	2008-09-01T00:00:00	2008-08-30	['None']
pomt-08880	A bill to cap carbon emissions "could cost Ohio 100,000 jobs."	mostly false	/ohio/statements/2010/aug/02/rob-portman/portman-uses-outdated-context-claim-cap-and-trade-/	The only thing better than accusing an opponent of losing jobs in Ohio’s hard-pressed economy is linking him or his party to proposals that might cause even higher Buckeye State unemployment. That’s what Rob Portman, the Republican running for U.S. Senate, attempts in a TV commercial that says a "job-killer" energy tax is "coming our way from Washington." "It could cost Ohio 100,000 jobs we cannot afford to lose," Portman says in the ad. Portman’s concern is shared by business leaders, especially manufacturers. But he nearly steers a legitimate concern off the rails with his 100,000 job-loss figure. The "energy tax" would come from a proposed bill to curb greenhouse gas emissions. Though the so-called cap-and-trade bill would not specifically impose a tax, it’s clear enough what Portman means. The bill would limit carbon emissions while creating a trading system so companies that cut their carbon output – by burning less coal, for instance – could sell their unneeded carbon credits. Companies that needed to exceed the caps could buy those credits. Unless there was generous help to companies in coal-reliant states like Ohio, a cap-and-trade bill could hurt, because there aren’t enough alternatives right now to coal-fired electricity. "The fact is that any carbon legislation is designed to make us not use coal," says Kevin Hassett, director of economic policy studies at the American Enterprise Institute, a conservative-leaning think tank in Washington. "So if you’re a state that has a lot of coal, you’re going to get hammered." Theoretically then, Portman’s broad fear is not off the mark, although various studies and analyses make conflicting claims. But Portman strays by claiming the cost could be 100,000 Ohio jobs, and by saying the bill "is coming our way." His job-loss figure comes from an analysis of a bill that the House of Representatives passed last year. Two problems: The analysis, from a study sponsored by the business-backed National Association of Manufacturers and the American Council of Capital Formation, predicted two potential outcomes. Ohio’s job losses by the year 2030 could range anywhere from 79,700 to 108,600, the study said. Yet Portman chose to go with a figure closest to the outside extreme. The bill he relies on in order to make the claim has stalled for a long time in the Senate with objections not only from Republicans but also from industrial-state Democrats like Ohio’s Sherrod Brown. Few people in Washington believe a broad cap-and-trade bill has a chance of passing, especially in an election year. "I sure wouldn’t want to bet the farm on it," says Stephen Hess, a senior fellow emeritus at the Brookings Institution, a centrist-liberal think tank. "I don’t think I’d even want to bet a weekend at Atlantic City." The House bill was sponsored by liberal members Edward Markey of Massachusetts and Henry Waxman of California. Senate Democrats don’t have enough of a majority to just rubber-stamp the Waxman-Markey bill, and Democrats like Brown are insisting on better economic protections for coal-reliant states. The campaign of Lee Fisher, Portman’s Democratic rival in the Senate race, says Fisher too believes the Waxman-Markey bill would harm Ohio unless it got better protections. That doesn’t mean a compromise cannot be fashioned, and several are on the table. One would require provisions to keep foreign manufacturers that don’t have carbon restrictions from gaining advantage and taking jobs from the United States. Another would grant extra carbon credits to keep companies in Ohio and similar states from paying too much while they transitioned to greener energy sources. Yet another, being considered as a separate bill that has President Barack Obama’s support, would create clean-energy manufacturing grants to help companies develop jobs in wind, solar and other alternative energy sources. Different interest groups, economists and lawmakers use different analyses to project the potential job losses or gains from these proposals. The Peterson Institute for International Economics said in May that a climate-change measure introduced by Sen. John Kerry, Democrat of Massachusetts, and Joe Lieberman, an independent from Connecticut, would prompt enough clean-energy investment in its first decade to add 203,000 new jobs nationally. But higher energy and product prices in the second decade would offset those job gains, the Peterson economists said. Economists at the University of California at Berkeley had a more optimistic take, saying that adoption of a House-style bill could add as many as 1.9 million jobs nationwide – with 35,000 to 61,000 of those in Ohio – by 2020. That is assuming that states have "balanced policies" that utilize not only a cap-and-trade system but also complementary policies for energy efficiency and clean technology, the authors said. For an additional take, we looked at a Congressional Budget Office analysis, published in May. The CBO examined three independent economic studies by outside groups: Brookings, Resources for the Future, and CRA International, a consulting firm. The CBO’s conclusion from these: Workers who rely on coal and other fossil fuels for their jobs would be affected, but eventually, most workers who lost jobs would find new ones. In particular, the CBO said, a "gradually increasing tax on greenhouse gas emissions," as envisioned in the Waxman-Markey bill, "would probably only have a small effect on total employment during the next few decades." The CBO did not quantify that, however. So we turned to the Bureau of Labor Statistics and took out our calculator. If 100,000 jobs were lost due to cap-and-trade, as Portman claims, that would represent a loss of anywhere from 2 percent to 2.4 percent of Ohio jobs, depending on how you measure today’s employment. That’s not a small effect – which would seem to put Portman’s claim at odds with the CBO’s analysis. A loss of 100,000 jobs "would be quite meaningful" in terms of overall Ohio employment, says Ken Mayfield, an economist and president of ClearView Economics of Pepper Pike. In his commercial, Portman couches his number by saying the state "could" lose that many jobs. And campaign spokeswoman Jessica Towhey says that Portman uses the 100,000 number because it comes from a legitimate study of the only cap-and-trade bill that has passed a chamber of Congress, making it more realistic than Senate proposals that are speculative for now. If Obama were to demand action, Towhey said, Senate Democrats could quickly line up in support and enact a final cap-and-trade bill. But the political roadblocks to Waxman-Markey in the Senate make its passage equally speculative -- unless there are concessions for states like Ohio. And Portman chose to use the worst-case conclusion on Waxman-Markey. In fact, last October another fact-checking outfit, Factcheck.org, affiliated with the University of Pennsylvania, did its own full review of the National Association of Manufacturers’ claim. It examined the national prediction rather than those for individual states, focusing on the claim that cap-and-trade could cost up to 2.4 million jobs. Factcheck.org turned to the same in-depth study by the Energy Information Administration, or EIA, that backers and detractors of Waxman-Markey were citing at the time. The EIA analyzed 11 different sets of assumptions, every one of which showed there would be fewer jobs in 2030 with the Waxman-Markey bill than without. But "only the most severely pessimistic set of assumptions" produced job losses on the scale cited by the manufacturers, and now repeated by Portman. And remember, that was the worst case scenario from two groups that tend to support big business’ side of the issue. That’s why we find Portman’s claim to be Barely True. Comment on this item. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.

pomt-00243	Says "On the Public Service Commission, (Kevin Cramer) raised his pay to over $93,650."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2018/oct/08/heidi-heitkamp/did-kevin-cramer-raise-his-own-salary-23000-no/	A new campaign ad in the North Dakota Senate race claims Republican contender Kevin Cramer gave himself a five-figure raise as a public official. "Could you give yourself a $23,000 raise?" the ad voiceover says. "Ask Kevin Cramer. On the Public Service Commission, he raised his pay to over $93,650." Cramer did get raises totalling that amount. But the ad completely distorts Cramer’s hand in securing the pay increase. The Public Service Commission has three commissioners who are elected to six-year terms. They regulate utilities, pipeline safety, telecommunications, railroads and other state services. Cramer joined the commission in August 2003. He served until the end of 2012, when he was elected to the U.S. House of Representatives. Commissioners’ salaries usually originate from the governor’s office, which works with the Office of Management and Budget to determine how much money is available for public officials, according to Jeff Larshus, director of state financial services at the OMB. The governor then submits a budget to the Legislative Assembly, which writes the salaries into statute and votes on their approval. So saying Cramer raised his own salary ignores the arbiter of that salary. The OMB proposed and received across the board salary hikes for elected officials every year between 2005 and 2012. These include the governor, lieutenant governor, secretary of state, attorney general, superintendent for public instruction, state auditor, state treasurer, and the tax, insurance, public service and agriculture commissioners. In 2005, they all got a 4 percent hike from their last salary number, determined in 2002. They got three more 4 percent hikes in 2006, 2007, and 2008, a 5 percent increase in 2009, another 5 percent increase in 2010, and then 3 percent in 2011 and again in 2012. While their salaries all differ, the percentage increases were equal across the board. That’s how Cramer’s salary jumped from $69,874 to $95,611 from the time he was elected to the time he left office — a $25,737 increase. "So did it go up considerably during that time frame?" Larshus said. "Yes. But it wasn’t because the commissioner asked for the salary." Commissioners submit a budget to the OMB every two years. There, they can suggest compensation for commissioners. But staff at the Public Service Commission and at the OMB said they could not recall an instance in which they had requested salary bumps for commissioners. The OMB had three of the four budget requests during which Cramer served and got salary hikes on file. Only one asked for equity funds to raise administrative staff salaries. But that does not include the commissioners, according to Jill Kringstad, Accounting Budget Specialist. She could not recall any instances where commissioners' salary increases were included in budget requests. The bottom line is that the legislative assembly needs to approve, write into law and vote on any proposed salaries for elected officials proposed by the OMB. These salary changes were all ultimately set by the legislature. Heitkamp’s office said Cramer could have refused to accept the raises or requested lower salary numbers to the OMB. The current governor had to change a North Dakota statute in order to fulfill his campaign promise to refuse pay. Our ruling Heitkamp said, "Could you give yourself a $23,000 raise? Ask Kevin Cramer. On the public service Commission, he raised his pay to over $93,650." Cramer’s salary increased by $25,737 during his tenure on the Public Service Commission. But he didn’t give himself that raise. The governor proposed it, the OMB drafted it, and the legislative assembly voted on its passage. The other 12 elected officials in North Dakota received the same percentage salary bump.

pomt-06398	"1.53 million jobs are at risk (from potential defense cuts)."	mostly true	/virginia/statements/2011/oct/29/randy-forbes/rep-randy-forbes-says-153-million-defense-jobs-are/	U.S. Rep. Randy Forbes, R-4th, is warning that potential cuts in defense spending would inflict mass destruction on the U.S. economy. Forbes, whose district is anchored in South Hampton Roads where military installations dominate the economy, unveiled a web ad saying the zeal to cut the nation’s debt has left U.S. defense vulnerable. The commercial says Congress must turn to other programs for savings, or face "catastrophe. " "1.53 million jobs are at risk," the ad’s narrator says. "Pink slips are waiting to be handed out." We wondered if 1.53 million defense jobs really are at risk in the latest round of federal budget negotiations. So we decided to take a look. First, a little background. After much debate in August, Congress agreed to raise the nation’s debt ceiling in return for long-range budget cuts. The first part of the deal called for reducing overall spending by $900 billion over the next 10 years, including about $400 billion in defense cuts. The defense budget is now about $700 billion a year. The legislation set up a 12-member, bipartisan super committee of senators and representatives to cut an additional $1.5 trillion in overall spending. If the group fails to reach consensus by Nov. 23, then $1.2 trillion in reductions will automatically occur -- half from defense and half from domestic programs. That cut to defense, combined with the $400 billion in reductions already agreed on, would mean a total loss of $1 trillion in defense money over the next 10 years. How does Forbes take that figure and compute job losses? Joe Hack, Forbes’ spokesman, pointed us to a comment by Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta in September that a $1 trillion defense cut could add 1 percent to the country’s unemployment rate. Hack then referred us to Bureau of Labor Statistics data showing the size of the U.S. labor force at about 154 million in September. Cutting 1 percent of that would lead to the loss of 1.53 million jobs, he said. We ran the numbers ourselves and found Forbes to be accurate. We came across other estimates that conclude $1 trillion in defense cuts would lead to significant layoffs, although not quite as high as Forbes states. The Department of Defenses says about 6 million jobs are supported by military spending, including 3.8 million private sector jobs, 700,000 Department of Defense jobs and 1.5 million active-duty service members outside of reserve units. "Sequestration ($1 trillion in cuts) assumes across the board spending cuts with losses peaking in the 2013-2014 time period, with 1 million to 1.5 million jobs lost and that could increase the U.S. unemployment rate by nearly 1 percentage point in the near term," said Lt. Col. Elizabeth Robbins, a spokeswoman of the Department of Defense. So Forbes’ number is at the top end of what the Department of Defense estimates as far as job losses. It could be as high as 1.5 million but as low as 1 million, according to the Pentagon. We asked the Defense Department to direct us to any underlying reports showing how they arrived at their numbers for job losses and lower unemployment rate, but they didn’t provide any. The Aerospace Industries Association, which represents aerospace and defense companies, estimates $1 trillion in defense cuts would cause a loss of slightly more than 1 million jobs. Some layoffs would occur among defense industry contractors and suppliers, but the bulk -- some 653,570 jobs -- would be lost in communities due to the to the loss of payroll spending associated with those jobs, the report states. The report was authored by Stephen Fuller, director of the Center of Regional Analysis at George Mason University. In a response to questions from Forbes at a October 26 hearing before the House Armed Services Committee, Fuller said his job loss projections don’t include tallies of lost active duty members or civilians employed by the Department of Defense. In an October 14, 2011 op-ed in the Wall Street Journal, the House Armed Services Committee Chairman, Buck McKeon, R-Calif., said automatic cuts from sequestration "would kill upwards of 800,000 of our active-duty, civilian and industrial American jobs." Claude Schafin, a House Armed Services Committee spokesman, said McKeon’s analysis doesn’t take into account any indirect layoffs in communities that would happen as a result of losses at the Department of Defense and their contractors. Projections of a 1 percent unemployment spike losses have drawn skepticism from some advocacy groups who charge they’re overblown. A study by Heidi Garrett-Peltier, a research professor at the University of Massachusetts, concludes the job losses from defense spending would be less than the Department of Defense estimates. Her work was funded by The Institute for Policy Studies, which says it advocates for a U.S. foreign policy based in part on demilitarization. In an interview Garrett-Peltier said a $1 trillion military cut over 10 years would cost about 860,000 jobs funded either directly or indirectly by the Department of Defense. If you include additional jobs losses in communities from a loss in spending from laid-off employees, the jobs loss would be 1.1 million, she said. Garrett-Peltier said government spending on defense does not generate as many jobs as investments in health care, education and other areas. "Are we better off cutting $100 billion in the defense budget or from education, health care, clean energy?" Garrett-Peltier said. "We would lose more jobs (from domestic cuts) than cutting $100 billion a year in defense." Our ruling: Forbes, in a web ad, says 1.53 million jobs would be lost if defense cuts hit $1 trillion. The congressman is clearly presenting a worst-case scenario, basing his figures on a statement by Defense Secretary Leon Panetta. The actual estimate by the Department of Defense -- which Forbes does not note -- is job loss between 1 million and 1.5 million. Other experts come up with smaller estimates, although their math does not always include all potential layoffs from reduced military -- such as local businesses, active duty members and the like. We don’t want to minimize the economic impact of $1 trillion in defense cuts. Forbes’ statement on the resulting job loss is credible, but very much on the high side estimates out there. We rate his claim Mostly True.	None	Randy Forbes	None	None	None	2011-10-29T07:00:00	2011-10-12	['None']
pomt-14784	The "federal government is going after school districts, trying to force them to let boys shower with little girls."	false	/texas/statements/2015/dec/04/ted-cruz/ted-cruz-incorrectly-says-obama-forcing-boys-and-g/	Sen. Ted Cruz recently veered from discussing Syria to suggesting our government wants schoolboys to shower with girls. The Republican presidential candidate commented after interviewer Steven Crowder mentioned "genetically proper pronouns." "Look," Cruz said, "these guys are so nutty that the federal government is going after school districts, trying to force them to let boys shower with little girls." The Texan went on: "Now listen: I’m the father of two daughters, and the idea that the federal government is coming in saying that boys, with all the god-given equipment of boys, can be in the shower room with junior high girls – this is lunacy. And I bet you there are a whole lot of parents – particularly parents of daughters – that are not eager to have the federal government saying, ‘Guess what? Your daughter has to shower with a boy, if he wants to be in there,’ " Cruz said. A video of the conversation was posted online Nov. 19, 2015. We hadn’t heard about a push for coed showers by the government under President Barack Obama and also didn’t hear back from Cruz’s campaign about how he concluded the government is trying to let boys shower with girls. But a Nov. 22, 2015, news story in The Advocate said Cruz "appeared to be alluding to the administration’s recent support of two separate transgender students who have sued their school districts after administrators refused to let the students use the restrooms and locker rooms that correspond with their gender identity." Our read: Just one of the mentioned situations involves a student seeking access to locker rooms, though news stories indicate there have been other recent instances of transgender individuals seeking unfettered access to high school locker rooms. What’s a transgender person? For starters, it’s not factually accurate to say that letting transgender students into locker rooms amounts to boys being permitted to shower with girls. A transgender individual is a person whose gender identity, expression or behavior is different from those typically associated with their assigned sex at birth, according to the National Center for Transgender Equality. Broadly, this can mean a person born a boy identifies as a girl or vice versa. A transgender also may receive hormone treatments and undertake sex reassignment surgery. Pat Griffin, a professor emeritus at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst, advocates for including lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender students in college and interscholastic athletics. Griffin wrote in September 2015: "It is important for policy-makers to understand that transgender girls (who were assigned a male gender at birth) are not boys. Their consistent and affirmed gender identity as girls is as deep-seated as the gender identity of non-transgender girls." After we posted this fact check, readers suggested we'd failed to capture the ongoing debate over transgender rights; we followed up by writing this story. "Student A" in Illinois The Advocate story led us to check into the case of an Illinois transgender girl barred by her school district from changing clothes for gym class and other activities with girls. The girl, represented by the ACLU of Illinois, filed a complaint in 2013 charging sex discrimination in violation of federal law. On Nov. 2, 2015, the Office of Civil Rights in the U.S. Department of Education wrote the superintendent of the school district in Palatine, Ill., northwest of Chicago, saying the district’s restriction violates Title IX, the federal bar on sex discrimination in any education program or activity. The ACLU of Illinois declared the federal holding had national significance. "The decision places school districts all across the nation on notice that Title IX requires making such facilities available for students who are transgender," the group said. "It is the first such decision issued by the department, building on legal briefs and policy statements of the federal government interpreting federal laws prohibiting discrimination." The office’s letter, signed by regional director Adele Rapport of Chicago, says "Student A" was born male and from a young age identified as female, transitioning in middle school "to living full-time as a young woman" and, among steps evidently not including sex reassignment surgery, taking "an ongoing course of hormone therapy." Also, the letter says, the district has given the student "unlimited access to all girls’ restrooms in the school" and "allows her to participate in girls’ athletics." According to the letter, the student, required to take a daily gym class, sought "an opportunity to change clothes privately within the girls’ locker rooms, in an area such as a restroom stall." The district answered that it would not be "practicable" to do so in the school’s six girls locker rooms "because there were too few stalls and too many students," the office wrote. The letter further says the student told the office in October 2015 she’d use privacy curtains in the locker rooms if the school made them available. Talks involving the district and office did not lead to a resolution, the letter says. School district stresses private changing rooms The Palatine-based Township High School District 211 said in a Nov. 2, 2015, press release it disagreed with the department’s ruling and beyond continuing settlement negotiations, it was prepared to "engage in all avenues of due process to determine whether our position of honoring the rights of all the students is within the law." The district’s release also said: "The students in our schools are teenagers, not adults, and one's gender is not the same as one's anatomy. Boys and girls are in separate locker rooms – where there are open changing areas and open shower facilities – for a reason." A Nov. 3, 2015, Chicago Tribune news story said the district had 30 days to reach an agreement with authorities or risk having its federal educational funding suspended or terminated and the matter also could be referred to the Department of Justice. And on Dec. 3, 2015, after Cruz made his claim, the government announced a settlement with the district agreeing to give the student access to school locker rooms "based on the student's request to change in private changing stations" in the rooms. Other conflicts A Nov. 2, 2015, New York Times news story on the Illinois dispute said: "The rights of transgender students have become the focus of disputes in school districts in many states, leading to divergent approaches regarding which sports teams they can play on, bathrooms they can use and pronouns they are addressed by. In separate cases, two California school districts agreed to lift restrictions on transgender locker room and restroom access after federal officials intervened. Students at one Missouri high school protested a decision by the district to let a transgender girl use female locker rooms and restrooms." In the Missouri instance, the Times reported Sept. 2, 2015, transgender Lila Perry, 17, used girls’ restrooms and locker rooms until a local protest led her to drop her physical education class. Professor’s take We called Griffin, the professor emeritus, who told us it’s her view that boys showering with girls is an inaccurate characterization of the government saying transgender students should, by law, have full access to school facilities including locker rooms. Griffin also called the education department’s ruling in Illinois "the developing precedent" nationally. Cruz’s statement, Griffin said, amounts to "fearmongering" and "reflects a complete ignorance" of transgender students, especially overlooking the fact that a transgender girl is not a boy so "it’s not a boy in the girls’ locker room." In contrast, Griffin said, the focus of most U.S. school officials has been on ensuring every student has a right to privacy in a locker room or restroom. Griffin, asked about state policies on transgender student-athletes, pointed us to a breakdown on Transathlete.com, which compiles policies and research regarding transgender inclusion in sports. According to the website, Texas ranks among about a dozen states with no policy ensuring transgender participation. The site touts Massachusetts’ policy, which says, in part: "Where there are sex-segregated classes or athletic activities, including intramural and interscholastic athletics, all students must be allowed to participate in a manner consistent with their gender identity." We also reached out to the federal education department, which did not comment on Cruz’s claim but pointed us to a Nov. 2, 2015, statement by Catherine Lhamon, an assistant secretary in the agency’s Office for Civil Rights, saying: "All students deserve the opportunity to participate equally in school programs and activities – this is a basic civil right. Unfortunately, Township High School District 211 is not following the law because the district continues to deny a female student the right to use the girls’ locker room. The district can provide access to this student while also respecting all students’ privacy." Our ruling Cruz said the "federal government is going after school districts, trying to force them to let boys shower with little girls." Cruz’s vision of schoolboys everywhere showering with girls grossly distorts the issue. The fact is the Obama administration has sided with transgender students seeking access to school facilities including locker rooms, holding that anything less would violate federal anti-discrimination requirements. Such conflicts — few and far between — haven’t had to do with the government wanting boys to shower with girls. We rate the claim False. FALSE – The statement is not accurate.

pomt-07520	"We’re paying out-of-state residential facilities hundreds of thousands of dollars, if not more," to house children in state custody	mostly true	/rhode-island/statements/2011/apr/08/roberto-dasilva/rep-dasilva-says-ri-pays-hundreds-thousands-dollar/	State Rep. Roberto DaSilva recently introduced legislation intended to make it much more difficult for the state Department of Children, Youth and Families to send children in its care to out-of-state residential treatment facilities. He said he was moved by the story of Nicholas Alahverdian, who was the subject of a column by The Providence Journal’s Bob Kerr. Alahverdian says he endured years of abuse and neglect in two out-of-state residential facilities where he was sent by DCYF. He has formed his own nonprofit organization to advocate for children in DCYF care. He has also filed state and federal lawsuits stemming from his alleged mistreatment. DaSilva said in a General Assembly news release that Rhode Island has the resources to provide children with the treatment they need within the state. DaSilva said he is concerned about the well-being of children in state care and also about keeping taxpayer dollars in the state. "We’re paying out-of-state residential facilities hundreds of thousands of dollars, if not more, to house our own state residents," DaSilva said. "It just doesn’t make sense, especially in these dire economic times." Among the children the DCYF takes into its custody are those who are victims of abuse or neglect caused by their primary caretakers, those who are in the juvenile justice system and ordered by courts to have access to rehabilitative care, and those with emotional, behavioral or developmental challenges who need out-of-home care and treatment and whose parents give DCYF temporary custody, according to DCYF interim Director Kevin J. Aucoin. The DCYF has said it is working to reduce its dependence on residential treatment programs, both in Rhode Island and in other states. So we wondered whether the agency is still spending as much as DaSilva says on such placements. We asked DaSilva where he got his information and he referred us to a website called the Rhode Island DCYF Transparency Portal. It shows the agency’s expenditures in various categories such as personnel and foster care. The top expenditure is residential services. For fiscal year 2010, for instance, the portal shows the state spent $117 million for residential care for youth in DCYF custody, which also includes costs for foster home placements and varous community services Much of that money was spent on local services such as Child and Family Services of Newport County or Ocean Tides, a residential treatment program in Narragansett for male juvenile offenders. The DCYF also budgets an additional $22.4 million this year for youths sent to the Rhode Island Training School. But the website shows that millions of dollars go to out-of-state programs. For example, Mass Mentor Inc., which provides services at several Massachusetts locations to children with developmental disabilities was paid $376,829 in the first quarter. During the same quarter, the Bennington School in Vermont was paid $77,769 and the Glen Mills School in Pennsylvania got $59,246. We asked Kevin J. Aucoin, interim director of DCYF, for more data. He said that this fiscal year, the DCYF expects to spend $65.5 million on residential services for 718 children, with $9.5 million going to out-of-state facilities, most of them in nearby states. Aucoin says the spending on residential programs has been declining. In fiscal year 2007, for example, the state spent $85.4 million for 1,102 children. In that year, it spent $18.4 million to send 154 children out of state. All residential placements are expected to be reduced as the agency adopts a new model of care that focuses on keeping families together. Aucoin said the DCYF sends children out of state for specialized treatments not offered by in-state providers. Those include multiple psychiatric diagnoses and severe and profound developmental disabilities. The majority, he said, have severe aggressive behaviors. Some may be youth with significant "sexual offending behaviors." Aucoin said children are placed out of state only with approval of the Family Court and only after the agency demonstrates there is no adequate program in-state. So it appears the only fault with DaSilva’s claim is it is too conservative. Instead of spending the "hundreds of thousands," DaSilva claims, the state actually expects to spend nearly $10 million on out-of-state programs. We find his claim to be Mostly True.

pomt-09612	Says Land Commissioner Jerry Patterson threatened to shoot him.	pants on fire!	/texas/statements/2010/jan/15/hector-uribe/hector-uribe-says-jerry-patterson-threatened-shoot/	Two former state senators are warming up Texas-style in anticipation of a fall showdown over who should be Texas land commissioner through 2014. Lately, they've kidded each other about gunplay. Democrat Hector Uribe's campaign went so far as to issue a press release suggesting the Republican he hopes to defeat, incumbent Commissioner Jerry Patterson, recently threatened to shoot him. Uribe's Jan. 11 release states: "Meanwhile, Uribe’s Republican opponent threatened to shoot him last week." Keeping our own tongues firmly in cheek, we checked into the claim. Uribe's spokesman, Harold Cook, traced Patterson's threat to an item in the online Quorum Report. In the Jan. 4 item, Patterson notes that he and Uribe both appeared in "The Alamo," a movie. Patterson wrote, according to the report: "Hector's a friend and fellow actor. We were both in the recent movie ‘The Alamo’, filmed near Austin, albeit on different sides in the conflict (actually Hector had a real part, I was just an extra). When Hector surrendered at San Jacinto, I should have shot him when I had the chance... " "I hope folks understand then we were just acting, now it's a real war," the item quotes Patterson saying. Contacted later, Patterson — who once helped pass Texas' concealed-weapon law — said he was joking about any shooting. "If it's not tongue-in-cheek stuff, that's a criminal offense," Patterson said. "You're not supposed to threaten people. Does this put me on the (federal) no-fly list?" Probably not. Especially when it's all just in good fun — and he didn't really make a threat. He just expressed ex post facto regret. This is why we love Texas politics. Where else would a (pretend) gunfight spill into a (real) race for land commissioner? And where else would we get to fact check a claim like this one? For making us laugh and for reminding us not to take this stuff too seriously, we give Uribe's claim that he was threatened a rating of Pants on Fire. And we suggest that all guns remain holstered for the rest of the campaign.	None	Hector Uribe	None	None	None	2010-01-15T11:58:00	2010-01-11	['None']
pomt-03983	Says abortions are decreasing.	true	/texas/statements/2013/feb/12/donna-howard/donna-howard-says-abortions-are-decreasing/	Responding to a question about lawmakers barring state aid to Planned Parenthood clinics, state Rep. Donna Howard said she hopes colleagues reverse course after they see the impact of clinic closings on constituents. The Austin Democrat, speaking at a Jan. 22, 2013, Texas Tribune public interview, also said such closings could drive up abortions. "Those who are claiming that they want to reduce abortion, which I think is just about everybody, I don’t think anybody wants to see that increase -- and in fact, it has be.en decreasing," Howard said. A reader asked us to check whether abortions are decreasing. We quickly found state and federal figures indicating a decrease. Howard’s chief of staff, Scott Daigle, guided us to information kept by the Texas Department of State Health Services, which says that "induced terminations of pregnancy" in the state totaled 77,592 in 2010, down from 77,850 the year before and 81,591 in 2008. Agency spokeswoman Carrie Williams provided a chart confirming those figures and covering additional years. She added, by email, that preliminary data indicate 72,470 abortions occurred in 2011 -- some 5,100 fewer than the year before. The chart shows that while the number of abortions decreased every year from 2009 through 2011, it went up in five of the eight previous years, topping out at 82,056 in 2006. Daigle also said that a November 2012 report by the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention states that abortions nationally decreased from 857,475 in 2000 to 784,507 in 2009. According to information posted online by the centers, those tallies drew from data submitted voluntarily by states and other "reporting areas," which it had been collecting since 1969. The 2009 abortion rate for 45 "reporting areas," ranging from states to New York City that had continuously provided data since 2000, the centers say, was 15.1 abortions per 1,000 women aged 15-44 years and the abortion ratio was 227 abortions per 1,000 live births. It said the figures were based on data evaluated from the areas that reported data every year during 2000-2009. Compared with 2008, the total number and rate of reported abortions for 2009 decreased 5 percent and the abortion ratio decreased 2 percent, CDC said. "The change from 2008 to 2009 represented the largest single-year decrease in the total number and rate of reported abortions for the entire period from 2000 to 2009," the center says. From 2000 to 2009 the number, rate, and ratio of reported abortions decreased 6 percent, 7 percent and 8 percent, respectively, to the lowest levels for the period, the center says. Historically, abortions surged after a key court ruling, then started decreasing. According to the centers’ Nov. 23, 2012, "Abortion Surveillance" report for 2009, abortions ramped up after the 1973 U.S. Supreme Court decision legalizing the procedure in all states.: After the decision, "the total number, rate (number of abortions per 1,000 women aged 15-44 years), and ratio (number of abortions per 1,000 live births) of reported abortions increased rapidly, reaching the highest levels in the 1980s before decreasing at a slow yet steady pace," the report says. "However, the incidence of abortion has varied considerably across demographic subpopulations, and recent reports through 2008 have suggested that the sustained pattern of decrease has leveled off. Continued surveillance is needed to monitor long-term changes in the incidence of abortion in the United States." Separately, we asked the Guttmacher Institute, which studies and advocates on issues related to reproductive health, for its analysis. Broadly, spokeswoman Rebecca Wind said by email, the "national numbers and rates of abortion were declining from the early 1990s to about 2005, but appear to have leveled off in the most recent period studied." She pointed us to a January 2011 Guttmacher paper on the incidence of abortion in 2007 and 2008, based on interviews of abortion providers, saying by phone that the next update, drawing on interviews being conducted this year, is to be published in early 2014. The 2011 paper includes a chart indicating that the number of U.S. abortions peaked at 1.6 million and hovered above 1.2 million from 2004 through 2008, the last year shown. The incidence of abortion changed little between 2005 and 2008, the paper says. The number of abortions increased by 0.5 percent, from 1,206,200 to 1,212,350, the paper says, while the abortion rate increased 1 percent, from 19.4 to 19.6 per 1,000 women aged 15-44. Also, the abortion ratio did not change over this period, remaining at 22 abortions per 100 pregnancies. Wind told us that while the decline in abortion had leveled off from 2005 through 2008, this followed a long-term decline in abortion rates. Our ruling Howard said abortions are decreasing. The Texas tally has dropped for several consecutive years, while nationally the total hovered around 1.2 million from 2005 through 2008, by one analysis, and the number and rate decreased in 2009, according to information analyzed by the Centers for Disease Control.

pomt-13607	"Toomey crossed party lines… to stop gun sales to suspects on the terror watch list."	mostly false	/pennsylvania/statements/2016/aug/15/independence-usa-pac/did-pat-toomey-cross-party-lines-tighten-gun-laws-/	As Pennsylvania Republican Sen. Pat Toomey battles for re-election in one of the most important senate races in the nation, it’s been his record on guns that’s drawn some of the most attention. It’s apparently part of why former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg endorsed Toomey, and Bloomberg’s political action committee is now running ads in support of Toomey that tout his efforts to "put our safety ahead of partisan politics." The Independence USA PAC bankrolled an ad running in Pennsylvania that claims "Toomey crossed party lines twice: first to support background checks, and now to stop gun sales to suspects on the terror watch list." We’ve written before about Toomey signing on in 2013 and putting his name on a bill that would have expanded background checks. But what about his efforts to stop gun sales to suspects on the terror watch list? Toomey’s record there is a bit murkier. To be clear: A bill that would stop gun sales to suspects on any sort of terror watch list has not passed. Efforts were made after the June shooting in Orlando at Pulse Nightclub, the deadliest mass shooting in American history, which left 49 people and the shooter dead. But those efforts were fruitless. There were several major bills drafted in the wake of Orlando that would have closed what’s been called "the terror loophole," or would make it harder for suspected terrorists on the federal government’s radar to buy guns. Two such bills -- both with largely partisan backing -- were brought up for a vote on June 20 and both were defeated. Proponents of a ban on gun sales to those on a terror watch list say individuals who are suspected terrorists appear on a no-fly list, but are still allowed to purchase guns. Opponents worry individuals who accidentally end up on the no-fly list would be stripped of their second amendment rights. The Democrats’ bill was a plan by Sen. Dianne Feinstein of California, and her bill would have placed a blanket ban on the purchase of guns by those on the no-fly list, as it was dubbed "no-fly, no buy." Some Republicans argued her bill didn’t give an out to people who may have ended up on the watch list mistakenly. Two Republicans voted in favor of Feinstein’s bill. Toomey wasn’t one of them, saying the bill didn’t include enough due process for potential gun owners. The majority of Republicans supported a bill from Sen. John Cornyn, of Texas. His measure, which was backed by the National Rifle Association, would have placed a three-day hold when anyone on the terror watch list attempted to purchase a gun. Within those three days, the government would have to present a case before a court in order to stop the person from buying the firearm. Though Toomey said in June that it would be hard for law enforcement to make Cornyn’s measure "workable," he voted in favor of it in the end. Toomey also drafted his own bill to close the terror loophole, which he touted as a measure that would bridge the gap between the Feinstein and the Cornyn amendments. Under Toomey’s plan, the U.S. attorney general would generate a list of "likely terrorists" separate from the existing no-fly list. The Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court would review the list, and the attorney general would have the power to block the purchase of a gun by an individual on that list. But Toomey’s bill largely flopped. Though he was reportedly in talks with gun control group Everytown for Gun Safety, the group ultimately didn’t endorse his proposal. Republican leaders didn’t put it up for a vote, and Democrats largely opposed it. When PolitiFact reached out to Toomey’s campaign to inquire about his record when it comes to closing the terror loophole, his campaign pointed out that Toomey was one of eight Republicans to support an amendment from Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, that would have given the Justice Department the ability to deny gun sales to individuals on two terror-related lists -- and it had an appeal process. That bill, which Toomey spoke on the Senate floor in favor of, had bipartisan support and survived a "test vote" several days after the Feinstein and Cornyn amendments failed. That showed that the bill had significant support, but not the 60 votes it would need to advance -- meaning GOP leaders probably won’t bring it up for a full vote any time soon. Independence USA, which is running the ads in Pennsylvania, didn’t respond to a request for comment. Our Ruling In an ad running in Pennsylvania, the Independence USA PAC backed by Mayor Michael Bloomberg claimed "Toomey crossed party lines… to stop gun sales to suspects on the terror watch list." This ad is misleading at its core, largely because a measure to stop gun sales to suspects on the terror watch list never passed. Toomey’s own bill failed to garner significant support from either side of the aisle. Though he voted for the Collins amendment which had bipartisan support, that amendment was drafted by a Republican. In the end, Toomey voted with his party when he voted against Feinstein’s bill and in favor of Cornyn’s. We rate the claim Mostly False.

pomt-01882	"We in this state saw more job creation in the last three years since I've been governor than you saw in the whole eight years of Doyle’s time as governor."	mostly true	/wisconsin/statements/2014/jul/09/scott-walker/scott-walker-says-job-growth-better-under-jim-doyl/	Gov. Scott Walker is unintimidated when it comes to sizing up his job growth numbers next to his predecessor’s. But did he create more jobs in his first three years than former Gov. Jim Doyle did over two full terms? Walker made that claim during a June 19, 2014 news conference at Milwaukee’s annual Water Summit. "We, in this state, saw more job creation in the last three years since I’ve been governor than you saw in the whole eight years of Doyle’s time as governor," Walker said. "So I think if people look, are we at where we want to be in terms of our goals? Going forward, voters will see the difference. The last thing we want to go back to is a much lower job creation number, even before the recession." Walker has focused a lot on Doyle’s record as he’s come under criticism from Mary Burke, the leading Democrat in the 2014 governor’s race, for lagging on his promise to help create 250,000 new private-sector jobs in his first four-year term. (We have rated that promise Stalled). Let’s see if Walker’s latest comparison holds up. Wisconsin private sector job growth When we asked Walker’s press secretary, Laurel Patrick, for data to back up this comparison, she cited the Quarterly Census of Employment and Wages, a set of data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. This is considered the gold standard when it comes to jobs data, as it is based on a survey of nearly all state businesses. It is released about seven months after every quarter ends. The scorecard as of June 19, 2014 shows the state lost 47,413 private-sector jobs by the end of Doyle’s eight-year tenure. Under Walker, the state gained 91,813 private sector jobs from 2011 through 2013. In Doyle’s first full term from 2003 through 2006, the state gained 86,530 jobs, which was still slower than the national average. It was 5,283 fewer jobs than were added during Walker’s first three years. Wisconsin has experienced slow-moving growth for the past decade, said Dale Knapp, research director at the Wisconsin Taxpayers Alliance, a private fiscal research group. "That’s simply the nature of our economy," Knapp said. "(Wisconsin) tends to go with the (national) economy but at a slower pace." State job creation has grown at this slow pace since at least 2000, a September 2013 Wisconsin Taxpayers Alliance study showed.The study tracked the state economy from 2000 to 2012 and found that job creation has declined as has population growth. It’s hard to create jobs if there aren’t workers to fill them. Digging deeper A more nuanced picture emerges when you look more closely at Doyle’s full time in office. In Doyle’s first term, from 2003 through 2006, the state gained 86,530 jobs, which was still slower than the national average. It was 5,283 fewer jobs than were added during Walker’s first three years. In December 2007, the Great Recession began -- about one year into Doyle’s second term. When the recession took its toll, the unemployment rate rose to 10 percent in Wisconsin and the state lost 133,943 jobs during Doyle’s second term. That created the net loss of 47,413 jobs by the end of 2010. By official measures, the recovery from the recession started in June 2009. Wisconsin saw a jobs turnaround in 2010, the last year Doyle was in office, when 33,658 jobs were added. That’s significant because it was the last time Wisconsin outpaced the national average in job growth. In 2011, when Walker took office, job growth did not keep up with the national or regional pace, according to a September 2012 study from the Center on Wisconsin Strategy, a non-profit think tank. The study shows Wisconsin lost 21,900 jobs between January 2011 and May 2012. That put its rate of job growth at 0.73 percent, slowest in the midwest and 42nd in the nation. Job growth has been slow yet steadily positive since 2011 but no evidence shows the pace is changing, according to Laura Dresser, Associate Director at the Center on Wisconsin Strategy. "Wisconsin is on the weak side of an already weak recovery," Dresser said. In the middle of a gubernatorial race, Walker has worked to frame the jobs issue to his advantage. So has Burke, who was secretary of commerce under Doyle from 2005 to 2007. Here are the year-by-year private sector figures going back to Doyle’s first year: Year Job growth percent Number of jobs gained or lost Doyle: 2003 +0.236% 5,479 Doyle: 2004 +1.69% 39,374 Doyle: 2005 +0.835% 19,741 Doyle: 2006 +0.928% 21,936 Doyle: 2007 +0.33% 7,970 Doyle: 2008 -2.34% -56,463 Doyle: 2009 -5.05% -119,108 Doyle: 2010 +1.5% 33,658 Walker: 2011 +1.322% 29,800 Walker: 2012 +1.47% 33,872 Walker: 2013 +1.21% 28,141 Said Knapp: "Governors like to take credit for growing jobs, but in the bigger picture, there’s not a whole lot they do that affects job creation. We’re more affected by what happens nationally than state policy." Last year, Wisconsin added 28,141 jobs at a rate of 1.2 percent that ranks 37th in the nation based on figures released June 19, 2014 by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. Our rating Walker said, "We in this state, saw more job creation in the last three years since I've been governor than you saw in the whole eight years of Doyle’s time as governor." Walker is right on the numbers that show Wisconsin did gain more jobs in his first three years as governor than Doyle did in his eight years. But there’s an indirect element of blame in his claim. On that score, it’s worth noting Wisconsin consistently trailed the nation in job growth before the Great Recession triggered the second-term losses that dragged down Doyle’s tally. Walker skates past that fact as he chooses a comparison most favorable to himself. We rate Walker’s claim Mostly True.	None	Scott Walker	None	None	None	2014-07-09T05:00:00	2014-06-19	['None']
pomt-14843	"71% of WI’s roads are in poor or mediocre condition and 14% of WI’s bridges are structurally deficient or functionally obsolete."	mostly true	/wisconsin/statements/2015/nov/18/jennifer-shilling/jennifer-shilling-71-state-roads-rated-poor-or-med/	In early November 2015, potholes prompted some crossing of party lines when the Legislature’s Joint Finance Committee approved Republican Gov. Scott Walker’s plan to borrow $350 million over the next two years for road projects. Democrats offered key support. Even before that, Senate Minority Leader Jennifer Shilling (D-La Crosse) was arguing more spending was needed. On Oct. 1, 2015 she tweeted this: "71% of WI’s roads are in poor or mediocre condition and 14% of WI’s bridges are structurally deficient or functionally obsolete. #JustFixIt" In Wisconsin’s budget battles over infrastructure, few deny the need for road maintenance. But is Shilling right about how bad the situation is? Digging into the numbers Shilling’s team directed us to a report from the U.S. Department of Transportation that cited the same statistics as the tweet -- that 71 percent of roads in Wisconsin are in poor or mediocre condition and 14 percent of bridges are classified as structurally deficient or functionally obsolete. So, the report is quoted accurately. But what about the numbers themselves? The two statistics were drawn from different sources of data. The data on road conditions came from the 2013 Report Card for America’s Infrastructure. The report, the most recent available, is put out by the American Society of Civil Engineers, a trade and advocacy organization. By the group’s tally, Wisconsin is one of just six states with at least 70 percent of roads rated in poor or mediocre condition, meaning our roads are in worse shape than the national average. But experts caution that the report card can overstate the amount of need for road repairs. First, the report uses a small source of data for each state and then extrapolates that data to the entire state roadway system. Ashwat Anandanarayanan, director of transportation policy for the environmental group 1000 Friends of Wisconsin, said the civil engineers’ reports also conflate new roadway construction and maintenance, resulting in what appears to be greater need. "Lots of roads need to be fixed," he said. "Not a lot need to be expanded." So then, what is a better measuring stick? The Wisconsin Department of Transportation collects its own data on road conditions that is used in the Highway Performance Monitoring System by the Federal Highway Administration, which is considered the gold standard of transportation information. According to these figures, the percentage of Wisconsin roads in poor or mediocre condition is much lower -- 38 percent of the state highway system falls into those categories. That doesn’t mean the state will fare better in a national comparison by that measure. In fact, the state lags behind the U.S. average in most indicators of roadway quality. As for bridges, Shilling said 14 percent of Wisconsin’s bridges were in disrepair or functionally obsolete. This statistic, which is accurate, came from WisDOT data submitted to the Federal Highway Administration. But while Shilling cites the number as evidence of the state being behind, Wisconsin does pretty well here in a national comparison. Only three states — Arizona, Minnesota and Nevada — reported a smaller percentage of bridges in disrepair. Our rating Shilling said "71 % of WI’s roads are in poor or mediocre condition and 14% of WI’s bridges are structurally deficient or functionally obsolete." The report she cited from the federal Department of Transportation backed up her figures, but the numbers used for her road statistic aren’t the most accurate available. By another measure, the percentage of roads in poor or mediocre condition is far smaller. There was no dispute on the bridge number, though on that front the state actually fares better than most others. We rate the claim Mostly True.

pomt-05465	Says the Congressional Budget Office has estimated "every penny of the federal budget will go to interest on the debt and entitlement spending by 2025."	true	/virginia/statements/2012/apr/23/frank-wolf/will-entitlement-programs-and-debt-consume-us-budg/	U.S. Rep. Frank Wolf says the nation’s fiscal future is dark. "According to the Congressional Budget Office’s long-term estimate, every penny of the federal budget will go to interest on the debt and entitlement spending by 2025," Wolf, R-10th, said in a March 28 speech on the House floor. "That means no money for national defense. No money for homeland security. No money to fix the nation’s crumbling bridges and roads. No money for medical research to find a cure for cancer or Alzheimer’s or Parkinson’s diseases," Wolf added. Is that really what the nonpartisan CBO said? Dan Scandling, Wolf’s spokesman, said his boss was referring to a June 2011 report from the CBO detailing the agency’s latest long-term outlook on the nation’s fiscal fitness. Tables in the report contain projections showing that by 2025, payments for Social Security, Medicaid, Medicare and debt interest will exceed all federal revenues going into the budget. That’s a shade different from Wolf’s statement that there won’t be any money at all to pay for additional programs since, beyond using tax revenues, the U.S. also has been known to borrow money to finance its budget. That technical distinction caught the eye of budget analysts we spoke to. But it doesn’t detract from Wolf’s gist that the CBO report shows the growing costs of entitlement programs and debt payments are eating up the government’s resources. The CBO’s scenario of exhausted revenues was based on the assumption that major U.S. policies in effect in June 2011 will continue indefinitely, such as extending the Bush tax cuts and preserving Medicare reimbursement levels to physicians. The CBO also laid out a second, more optimistic outlook that assumed laws on the books in June 2011 will take effect. That means that the Bush tax cuts would actually expire at the end of this year and Medicare payments to physicians would fall sharply in 2013. Under that scenario, revenues through 2085 would always stay above the costs of entitlement programs and interest payments on the national debt. So Wolf is focusing on the bleakest CBO outlook. Is that fair? Jim Horney, a vice-president at the liberal Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, said Wolf is not alone in citing the dark scenario. Although current laws call for ending all the Bush tax cuts and lowering Medicare reimbursements, Horney said it will be politically difficult for Congress to carry out these actions. Wolf’s statement is similar to the conclusion reached in 2010 by a bipartisan commission appointed by President Barack Obama to recommend ways reduce the national debt. "By 2025 (federal) revenue will be able to finance only interest payments, Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security," the National Commission on Fiscal Responsibility and Reform stated in its final report. "Every other federal government activity -- from national defense and homeland security to transportation and energy -- will have to be paid for with borrowed money." Two analysts told us the gloomy forecast offers the most realistic map of the financial road ahead. Jason Peuquet, research director at the centrist Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, said his organization has run its own numbers and concluded that entitlement and debt interest will outpace revenues in 2026. Josh Gordon, policy director at the centrist Concord Coalition,a group that urges deficit reduction, pointed to a March 2012 report from the General Accounting Office that shows at some point between 2020 and 2030, the amount of spending on entitlements and interest will outpace all federal revenues going into the budget under the more pessimistic scenario. "The real key is the revenues are still pretty low," Gordon said. "The lower the revenue, the easier it is for spending programs to be larger than it." Our ruling Wolf said the CBO projects that by 2025, every penny of the federal budget will go to interest on the debt as well as spending on Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security. The CBO report he cites says entitlements programs and debt interest will consume all the revenues going into the budget that year. Wolf’s language is a bit inexact, but we don’t think it detracts from his clear point: the U.S. is on a dangerous fiscal path. We rate his statement True.

pomt-11030	"The deficit ... is coming down, and it’s coming down rapidly."	pants on fire!	/truth-o-meter/statements/2018/jul/02/larry-kudlow/larry-kudlow-wrong-about-deficits-falling-rapidly-/	Larry Kudlow, director of the National Economic Council for President Donald Trump, raised eyebrows when he said in a Fox Business Network interview that the nation’s deficit is falling on Trump’s watch. The economy under President Donald Trump, Kudlow said on June 29, "is throwing out enormous amounts of new tax revenues. As the economy gears up, more people working, better jobs and careers -- those revenues come rolling in, and the deficit, which is one of the other criticisms (of Trump’s economic policy), is coming down, and it’s coming down rapidly. Growth solves a lot of problems." See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com As it happens, the deficit hasn’t come down to date -- which sparked a quick backlash on social media and prompted Kudlow to amend his remarks later that day. Kudlow told the Washington Post that "the economy is so strong right now it’s going to produce lower deficits. I probably should have said future deficits." However, that assertion is questionable as well. The most trusted source for future budget projections, the Congressional Budget Office, shows rising deficits for years into the future. The deficit so far under Trump In fiscal year 2015, when Barack Obama was president, the federal deficit was $438 billion. (A refresher: The deficit refers to federal revenues minus federal outlays. Each year’s deficit adds to the overall public debt.) In fiscal year 2016, which was also under Obama, the deficit rose to $585 billion. In fiscal year 2017, which was about two-thirds on Trump’s watch, the deficit rose to $665 billion. The deficit also rose as a percentage of the nation’s gross domestic product -- a way of comparing economic statistics across time. In fiscal year 2015, the deficit was 2.4 percent of GDP, rising to 3.2 percent of GDP in fiscal 2016 and 3.5 percent in fiscal 2017. So on a full-year basis, Kudlow is wrong. He’s also wrong if you look at the first seven months of fiscal year 2018. According to the Treasury Department, the first seven months of the current fiscal year saw a deficit of $385 billion -- which is 12 percent higher than the first seven months of fiscal year 2017, when the deficit totaled $344 billion. The future course of the deficit As for the future, CBO finds no reason to expect the deficit to go down any time soon. For fiscal year 2018, CBO projects a deficit of $804 billion, rising each successive year to $981 billion in 2019, $1 trillion in 2020, $1.1 trillion in 2021, and $1.3 trillion in 2022. The deficit is also poised to increase as a percentage of GDP -- from 3.5 percent in 2017 to 4.0 in 2018 and eventually to 5.4 percent in 2022. Here’s the full chart from CBO’s most recent projections, released in April. Not only that, but CBO specifically cited the tax cut Trump backed and signed into law as a reason for spiraling deficits. "The deficit that CBO now estimates for 2018 is $242 billion larger than the one that it projected for that year in June 2017," CBO wrote in its April report. "Accounting for most of that difference is a $194 billion reduction in projected revenues, mainly because the 2017 tax act is expected to reduce collections of individual and corporate income taxes." And the projections would be even worse if Congress doesn’t allow the recent round of tax cuts to expire. "In that scenario, far larger deficits and much greater debt would result than in CBO’s baseline projections for the 2019–2028 period," CBO wrote. Our ruling Kudlow said, "The deficit ... is coming down, and it’s coming down rapidly." After being criticized, he later clarified that he "probably should have said future deficits." Kudlow’s first formulation is wrong, and his revised version isn’t supported by the most widely trusted barometer -- projections by the CBO. Trump tax bill, which dramatically cut revenues, is a big reason why. The statement is inaccurate and ridiculous. We rate the statement Pants on Fire!

pomt-03987	There are twice as many gun shops as McDonald’s in the United States.	mostly true	/georgia/statements/2013/feb/11/markel-hutchins/are-there-more-places-buy-gun-big-mac/	So what’s easier to find? The golden arches or a gun shop. The Rev. Markel Hutchins, an Atlanta-based civil rights activist, had an answer during a recent discussion about federal gun legislation on "The Ryan Cameron Show," which airs weekday mornings on V-103 FM in Atlanta. "There are twice as many gun shops as McDonald’s," Hutchins said. McDonald’s eateries are just about everywhere in America. PolitiFact Georgia was listening while stuck in traffic and wanted to find out whether Hutchins’ claim is true that there are more places to buy a gun than to grab a Happy Meal. Hutchins wants laws to restrict the availability of handguns across the country, particularly in urban areas such as Atlanta. He led a rally last week outside the headquarters of gun manufacturer Glock, located in Smyrna, a northern suburb of Atlanta. Hutchins says gun rights advocates are distorting the intent of the Second Amendment, saying it was written to allow Americans to arm themselves to protect the nation. There had been a spate of high-profile shootings in Atlanta a week before Hutchins’ interview. A 14-year-old boy was shot, allegedly by a 15-year-old boy, on the campus of an Atlanta middle school. The student who was wounded was not seriously injured. A day after that shooting, a Morehouse College student was shot inside a gym on the campus. The student was reportedly in stable condition and expected to make a full recovery. Hutchins said he was indeed claiming that there are more gun shops nationwide than McDonald’s restaurants. Hutchins sent us an ABC News article published in mid-December to back up his claim and said he did some additional research because he didn’t believe it was true. "My God, it was right there," he said. The McDonald’s website contains a number of facts and figures, including how many restaurants there are in the country. The latest tally, as of 2011, was 14,098 in the United States. There were 33,510 worldwide, the website shows. The number on the restaurant’s website matched what ABC reported. The news outlet reported there are 51,438 retail gun stores in America. Programs, such as American Public Media’s "Marketplace," have reported the total is about 58,000. Some online research we did found others making similar claims that there are twice as many gun stores as McDonald’s in America. Those numbers, however, are more complicated than they first appear. What Hutchins and some news outlets have referred to as "guns stores" are actually federal permits issued to sell guns. Those could represent retail establishments that primarily sell guns, larger retail vendors (such as Wal-Mart) that sell guns as part of a much larger retail venue or pawnshops that carry guns as part of their inventory. The numbers also refer to people who sell guns at gun shows several times a year and have no bricks-and-mortar store. We attempted to make an oranges-to-oranges comparison here -- to compare McDonald’s locations to free-standing stores that primarily sell guns. It’s hard to find detailed data on actual gun stores online. The U.S. Census Bureau does not keep data on gun stores. Neither does the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. The U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms keeps a monthly log on its website of how many people and pawnbrokers are licensed to sell guns in the country and its territories. In January, the total was 58,725. About 51,000 of them were gun dealers. The rest were pawnbrokers. In Georgia, the total in January was 1,746. In 2011, to be consistent with the most recent information we have about the number of McDonald’s restaurants nationwide, there were 56,059 federally licensed firearms dealers and pawnbrokers in the country. That’s quadruple the number of places to buy Chicken McNuggets. The ATF does not track how many licensed dealers own a business that they sell guns from as opposed to those who may sell guns at a show. The ATF database has lists of every person licensed to sell guns. In Georgia, most people on the January list say they own a business. There were about 175 people on the list with a license who did not include the name of a business. About 100 of them are retail stores such as Wal-Mart, Dick’s Sporting Goods and Academy Sports & Outdoors. In some cases, the list contains the name of the person licensed to sell guns and the business itself. The leader of an organization of firearms retailers had a lower estimate of how many gun shops there are nationally. Andrew Molchan, president of Professional Gun Retailers Association, believes there are probably 9,000 "real" gun stores in America. His definition of a gun store is a place that regularly sells the weapons year-round. His estimate did not include businesses such as Wal-Mart because some of those stores do not sell any guns. Molchan said it’s tough to come up with a firm number of how many gun stores there are for several reasons. For example, he said some pawnshops sell only a handful of guns year-round. "It’s not hard and crisp," Molchan said of coming up with an actual estimate of how many gun shops there are in the U.S. When told about Hutchins’ claim, Molchan replied, "That’s not necessarily wrong." Some people, he said, may have a license to sell guns, but they don’t sell any at all. He believes there are probably as many as 25,000 businesses that sell guns. To sum up, Hutchins said there were twice as many gun shops than McDonald’s restaurants in the United States. There are numbers we found that support his argument. But this claim, like many we’ve tackled, is not as simple as it seems. His overall point seems accurate -- there are a lot of places to buy guns in the United States. Our rating: Mostly True.

pomt-07256	The Democratic health care law "added 12 years of solvency to Medicare."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/may/27/debbie-wasserman-schultz/did-health-care-law-add-12-years-solvency-medicare/	Ever heard of Medi-scare? It’s political slang that means attacking opponents for their plans to rein in Medicare spending. Republicans say they’re victims of Medi-scare because Democrats keep distorting their recent proposal, a plan to turn Medicare into a program where seniors buy their own health insurance plans and the federal government pays part of the tab. The plan wouldn’t apply to anyone 55 or older, but would start for new enrollees in 2022. Still, it would be a dramatic change from the current system, where the government pays doctors and hospitals directly. A Democrat won a close special election in upstate New York on May 24 after campaigning against the plan, prompting Republicans to complain that Democrats were demagoguing the plan. Boo hoo, say Democrats like Debbie Wasserman Schultz. It was just last year that Republicans tried to scare seniors by telling them the health care law would gut Medicare spending, said Wasserman Schultz, who was recently named head of the Democratic National Committee. "It's the pot calling the kettle black when it comes to who's engaging in Medi-scare," said Wasserman Schultz in an interview on MSNBC on May 25. "The Republicans leading up to the 2010 election actually fabricated what Democrats did to Medicare. In fact, we added 12 years of solvency to Medicare and ensured that it would be better for seniors overall. And what the Republicans have done under Paul Ryan's plan is actually end Medicare as we know it, turn into it into a voucher program. There's no running from that." We documented a slew of Mediscare ads against Democrats during the 2010 election cycle. But we were interested in the wonkier question of whether the health care law did indeed add 12 years of solvency to Medicare. Solvency in this case means the money flowing into Medicare covers 100 percent of the bills for patient care. We started researching the issue, and at first, Wasserman Schultz seemed on solid ground. In August 2010, the Medicare Board of Trustees reported that the health care law did indeed add 12 years of solvency to Medicare Part A, the portion of Medicare that covers hospitalization. It also improved the financial outlook for Part B, which covers physicians’ services and other care. The report specifically credited the Democratic health care law, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, passed earlier that year. We should note those estimates come with a few warnings. The report itself says that projecting health care costs into the future includes many uncertainties. Additionally, the report doesn’t include changes that Congress will likely make to current law, especially the predictable increases in payments to physicians known as the doc fix. Also, the independent chief actuary for Medicare questioned whether the projected cost savings were realistic. But overall, the board of trustees report is an official estimate for the Medicare program, the reports are put together with a consistent, detailed methodology, and its annual reports are usually referred to by both parties. The bigger problem with Wasserman Schultz's statement is that just a few weeks ago, the board of trustees issued a new report that revised its estimates for the health care law. Instead of adding 12 years of solvency, the board concluded, the law will only add eight years of solvency. Starting in 2024, the program will need either new revenues or reduced expenses to meet all of its obligations. The board said the shortfall was because of the continuing economic slowdown, which has reduced the Medicare program’s income from taxes, and a few other lesser factors. So Wasserman Schultz’s number is off by about a third. Nevertheless, her overall point, that the Democrats’ health reform law added to the overall solvency of Medicare, is correct. The 2011 report included the same warnings that estimating health care savings for the future is an uncertain process, but it also concluded that the financial outlook for Medicare is "substantially improved as a result of the changes in the Affordable Care Act." The law reduced spending and increased revenues in several ways. It slows increases in payments to hospitals and nursing homes. It raises Medicare hospital taxes for high earners. And it introduces several new programs aimed at steering the health system away from paying doctors and hospitals per procedure ("fee for service") and instead paying for good outcomes. When we contacted her office, a spokesman said that the number may have been off, but the point was still right. "The important thing is that Democrats moved to substantially extend the life of the Medicare Trust Fund while also making broad improvements to Medicare," said spokesman Jonathan Beeton. To summarize, Wasserman Schultz said that the Democratic health care law "added 12 years of solvency to Medicare." She’s off on the number, citing an older, more optimistic report. The latest estimate indicates Medicare will only have eight additional years of solvency, one-third less than the previous estimate. But she’s right that the Affordable Care Act improved the financial outlook for Medicare, and that Democrats have successfully passed legislation to reduce future spending for the program. So we rate her statement Half True.	None	Debbie Wasserman Schultz	None	None	None	2011-05-27T14:57:46	2011-05-25	['Democratic_Party_(United_States)', 'Medicare_(United_States)']
pomt-04037	Says according to the FBI, more people are killed each year with hammers and clubs than rifles.	true	/texas/statements/2013/jan/30/greg-abbott/greg-abbott-says-according-fbi-more-people-are-kil/	Not long before President Barack Obama’s Jan. 16, 2013, speech calling for more gun control measures, Texas’ attorney general tweeted about a different class of assault weapons. Greg Abbott wrote, "FBI: More people killed with hammers & clubs each year than rifles," and supplied a link to a Jan. 3, 2013, Fox News commentary piece that originated on Breitbart.com and referred to FBI murder statistics from 2005 through 2011. PolitiFact in Washington, D.C., recently tackled a similar claim culled from Facebook: Obama was on the record supporting bans on certain semi-automatic rifles before his Jan. 16 speech, in which he again called for renewing the 1994-2004 federal "assault weapons" ban while urging education, mental health and other measures to reduce gun violence. Like Abbott’s tweet, the Facebook post cited the FBI. PolitiFact looked at the bureau’s annual report on "Crime in the United States," a collection of data from local agencies on several categories of crimes. The Facebook post earned a "True" rating because it reflected the FBI’s statistics from 2011, the most recent year available, for murders with knives (1,694), personal weapons (728, typed on Facebook as 726), blunt objects (496) and rifles (323). The Facebook post did not include homicides the FBI attributed to handguns (6,220), firearms whose type was not stated (1,587) and "other guns" (97). Those numbers mean handguns were used in 72 percent of all firearm murders in 2011 and slightly under half of all murders using any kind of weapon that year. Abbott’s tweet, similarly, did not include some FBI-tracked categories by referring solely to rifles and blunt objects and leaving out other significant firearm categories. Still, according to the FBI’s data covering 2005 through 2011, blunt objects such as clubs and hammers were consistently used to murder more people than rifles alone. FBI homicide data 2005-2011, ranked in order of weapons used most often in 2011: Our ruling Like an older Facebook item, Abbott’s tweet uses data selectively, ignoring the significant role of handguns in gun violence. That said, it is correct that FBI data indicates that in 2011, more people were killed with "clubs and hammers" than with any type of rifle. We rate his statement as True. Clarification: This story originally posted with the "speaker" identified as "Facebook posts" instead of Greg Abbott. Updated 2:54 p.m. Jan. 30, 2012.

pomt-07380	"You’ve got each day 10,000 new seniors, baby boomers, becoming eligible for the entitlement programs."	true	/virginia/statements/2011/may/04/eric-cantor/rep-eric-cantor-says-10000-baby-boomers-day-are-be/	Amid the pop of champagne at the start of 2011, you many not have noticed the beginnings of a monumental event that will reshape America. The first baby boomers turned 65. Every day this year, and for the next 18 years, multitudes more will turn 65 and begin to rely on the nation’s already-stressed entitlement programs. Baby boomers are Americans born between Jan. 1, 1946 and Dec. 31, 1964. Their 65th birthdays mark the beginning of eligibility for Medicare and fall one year before their full qualification for Social Security. House Majority Leader Eric Cantor has been blanketing cable networks to promote the House GOP budget and the need for major spending cuts. His effort comes as Congress and the president grapple with both the 2012 federal budget and more immediate need to raise the debt ceiling. Appearing on CNBC April 27, Cantor, R-Va., said "you’ve got each day 10,000 new seniors, baby boomers, becoming eligible for the entitlement programs. Ten thousand a day." Is Cantor’s number right? We asked Megan Whittemore, Cantor’s press secretary, where the congressman came up with the figure of 10,000 seniors a day becoming eligible for entitlements. She pointed us to a series of statements and reports by the Social Security Administration. In October 2007, when the first baby boomer claimed early retirement benefits from Social Security, the agency put out a press release. Kathleen Casey-Kirschling, born one second after midnight on Jan. 1, 1946, qualified for payments in January 2008, the agency said, adding that "over the next two decades, nearly 80 million Americans will become eligible for Social Security benefits, more than 10,000 per day." Social Security allows recipients to start claiming benefits at age 62, though that means accepting a lower monthly payout. The full retirement age for boomers born in 1954 or earlier is 66. It then increases by two months in each of the next six birth years, with everyone born 1960 or later getting full benefits at age 67. Retirees can choose to defer payments up until they’re 70, receiving a larger monthly check in return. The Social Security agency also referred to the 10,000-a-day statistic in its report for fiscal 2012. The Pew Research Center highlighted the statistic in a 2010 study on baby boomers. According to Census data gathered by Pew, 76 million people were born in the United States during the generation. After subtracting those who have already died and adding immigrants born during those years, the Census estimates there are roughly 79.6 million people aged 45 to 64 in America. If you divide 79.6 million by 19 years, then divide that by 365 days, you get 11,478. That’s the number of people, on average, who will turn 65 each day for the next 19 years. Obviously not everyone in that category will live to 65, but the math clearly gives you a figure above the 10,000-a-day cited by Cantor. We also checked the Social Security awards given in 2010. According to the SSA, 4.05 million retired workers or survivors of deceased workers started getting payments last year. That means 11,102 people each day began receiving checks. In 2009 the number was slightly higher, at 11,436 per day. Right now, about 8,600 people a day enter Social Security through the traditional retirement program, and another 3,000 each day through the programs for families of disabled or deceased workers. If the head count climbs up to 11,400 per day through the traditional program, plus another 3,000 per day through the programs for families of disabled or deceased workers, that’s almost a 25 percent increase in the number of Social Security beneficiaries. And consider this: In 1950, as Social Security ramped up, there were 16 workers per recipient. Today there are 2.9 workers per recipient, and by 2041 the SSA says there will be just 2.1 workers per recipient. Let’s review. Rep. Eric Cantor said 10,000 Americans per day become eligible for entitlement programs, meaning Social Security and Medicare. His number are borne out in projections and data from the Social Security Administration. During 2009 and 2010 ,the number of Social Security recipients was actually above 11,000 per day, though many of those people were not retirees. Census data show nearly 80 million baby boomers, born over a span of 19 years. They will turn 65 and become eligible for Medicare at a rate of 11,478 per day. In fact, as of May 3 an estimated 1.4 million people have turned 65 this year. The numbers are staggering. We rate Cantor’s statement True.

pomt-02834	"All" University of Texas "student-athletes get an iPad."	mostly false	/texas/statements/2013/nov/22/jody-conradt/university-texas-student-athletes-may-borrow-limit/	Speaking against paying student-athletes, a long-time Texas Longhorn official said sports scholarships already include special benefits. Jody Conradt, a University of Texas special assistant, said during a Sept. 28, 2013, Texas Tribune Festival panel discussion on the UT campus: "I have to make one point. We’re not just talking about a scholarship as defined by scholarship. We’re talking about the money spent, unlimited tutors, unlimited access to athletic training; all of your injury issues are taken care of. You can get money to go home at Christmas if that is an emergency… You can get clothes, through a program called the Student Athlete Opportunity Fund." Conradt, who coached the UT women’s basketball team for 31 years, continued: "So over time there have been ways to give more benefit to student-athletes that is not what people consider the scholarship." For instance, she said, "all... student athletes get an iPad. They get a lot of things that the normal student does not." Most of those declared benefits didn’t surprise us. But does each UT student-athlete get the popular Apple iPad tablet (which were retailing for about $180 to $500, depending on screen sizes and other features, when we online window-shopped this November)? Nick Voinis, UT’s senior associate athletic director, told us by phone that UT’s student-athletes, who numbered 551 as of mid-November, may borrow iPads, Amazon Kindles and other electronic equipment thanks to a fund created by the National Collegiate Athletic Association, the governing body for intercollegiate athletics. Voinis stressed that many student-athletes come to school already having computers, laptops or iPads. Still, he said, the option is there for those students to check out a laptop or iPad. "Some check them out for a day or two, some for a semester," Voinis said, or the full year. He said the programs keeps 30 tablets, mostly iPads, available for checkout. For the year that started in August 2013, Voinis said, nearly $338,000 flowed from the NCAA to UT’s Student Athlete Opportunity Fund. Those dollars, he said, could be spent on computers, laptops, iPads, school supplies and other items such as university fees not covered by scholarships, including emergency trips home. That’s correct, a NCAA official told us. According to an Aug. 22, 2012, online post by the NCAA, the association and its member schools in 2010-11 paid more than $53 million to more than 81,000 student-athletes. "The money, which comes from the NCAA’s Student Assistance Fund, paid for trips home, clothing, summer school, tutoring, graduate test fees, health insurance and countless other costs that scholarships don’t cover," the NCAA said. "A version of the Student Assistance Fund was first offered in 1999, after the NCAA inked a $6 billion broadcast deal with CBS. The decision to start the fund came from the NCAA’s desire to give back to student-athletes more directly than through grants or other forms of aid that are often laden with restrictions. The fund has grown each year since its inception." By email, NCAA spokeswoman Stacey Osburn pointed out an association rule (15.01.6.1) restricting how such aid is spent. The rule says universities shall not tap such aid to finance salaries, grants-in-aid (other than summer school) for student-athletes with remaining eligibility, capital improvements, stipends and outside athletics development opportunities for student-athletes (e.g., participation in a sports camp or clinic, private sports-related instruction, greens fees, batting cage rental, outside foreign tour expenses)." So iPads are permitted, it looked to us. We recognized another way that some student-athletes land iPads--as gifts to participants in football bowl games. Players in the 2012 Valero Alamo Bowl, which was won by the Texas Longhorns, received $550 worth of gifts including an iPad Mini, bowl spokesman Rick Hill told us by phone. Our ruling Conradt said all UT student-athletes get an iPad. That’s not so, though less than 30 iPads are available for UT’s 500-plus student-athletes to borrow for up to a year at a time. We rate this statement, which has an element of truth but otherwise ignores critical facts, as Mostly False.

pomt-13639	"The Obama-Clinton war on coal has cost Michigan over 50,000 jobs."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/aug/09/donald-trump/donald-trump-exaggerates-michigan-job-losses-coal-/	During an economic address at the Detroit Economic Club, Donald Trump tailored some of his statistics to the local audience. "As a result of recent Obama EPA actions, coal-fired plants across Michigan have either shut down entirely or undergone expensive conversions, making them non-competitive in many cases," Trump said. "The Obama-Clinton war on coal has cost Michigan over 50,000 jobs." Trump has often criticized efforts by the Obama administration -- and those who find climate change to be a serious concern -- to wean the United States from fossil fuels by tightening federal environmental regulation of coal-fired power plants. Here, we’ll take a look at the second part of Trump’s statement: "The Obama-Clinton war on coal has cost Michigan over 50,000 jobs." This assertion initially caught our eye because we’d never thought of Michigan as one of the premier coal-producing states. Our suspicion was correct: According to the National Mining Association, Michigan is not on the list of 26 states that currently produce any amount of coal. Meanwhile, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the number of workers engaged in any type of mining in Michigan over the last decade has varied between 5,000 and 7,000, making it essentially impossible to have lost 50,000 existing jobs in that sector. And as the Washington Examiner has noted, Michigan has fewer than 20,000 people working in the electricity generation sector today. So the scale of the job losses Trump cites seem, at least at first blush, to be unlikely. So what was Trump trying to say? The prepared version of his speech includes a footnote that points to a news release from the National Mining Association published almost five years ago, on Sept. 7, 2011. Here are some excerpts from that news release, which criticized "Beyond Coal," a campaign against coal-fired power plants coordinated by the environmental group the Sierra Club and cited a study the group released: "The destructive impact of the ‘Beyond Coal’ campaign is most clearly evident in the following 10 states where power plants blocked by the club represent the highest number of potential jobs (construction and permanent) foregone: Illinois (126,612), Texas (122,065), Montana (114,102), Nevada (75,194), Florida (75,055), Ohio (70,371), Colorado (55,620), Michigan (53,587), Oklahoma (42,581) and Kentucky (38,824)." In response to an inquiry from PolitiFact, Andrew Wheeler, an energy adviser to the Trump campaign, also pointed to a U.S. Chamber of Commerce analysis that found that 10 delayed or canceled projects in Michigan -- most of them coal-fired plants -- would have created 56,000 jobs up front had they been built. Between the 53,000 jobs cited by the National Mining Association and the 56,000 jobs cited by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, Wheeler said, "it is obvious that the ‘over 50,000 jobs’ cited by Mr. Trump is accurate." But just because a campaign is able to footnote a specific number doesn’t mean that the number is meaningful, or as fully contextualized as it ought to be. Here are a few important things to know about this number. • The number refers to "potential" jobs lost, not actual jobs lost. This is an important point that would not be obvious from the way Trump phrased his statement. By leaving the impression that these were actual jobs lost, Trump’s statistic invites a degree of outrage that isn’t warranted. And there are good reasons to be cautious about future job projections, especially when they have been framed so broadly as to include vendors to the industry, rail transport, ports and machinery manufacturers. Any job projections of this sort are subject to rosy estimates -- especially if a group has a vested interest in the issue. In making an argument to the public, all groups will put forward their most favorable case. Trey Pollard, the national press secretary for the Sierra Club -- which has its own dog in the fight -- said the number of plants being counted by the mining association are essentially "the coal industry’s wildest dreams" -- a reflection of circumstances in which they can build coal plants "in any community they want to." • The number doesn’t reflect that coal is increasingly being replaced by natural gas. Trump’s decision to use this number tells only part of the story of how the electricity sector has been developing. In recent years, according to federal statistics, coal has been losing ground to natural gas and, to a lesser extent, renewable energy when it comes to electricity generation. A July 2016 analysis by Sam Evans of the School of Business and Economics at King University in Bristol, Tenn., found that environmental regulation has been a factor in this switch, but a "secondary" one. "The recent decline in the generation share of coal, and the concurrent rise in the share of natural gas, was mainly a market-driven response to lower natural gas prices that have made natural gas generation more economically attractive," Evans wrote. • This isn’t just about Obama or Clinton. Trump ignores that much of the impetus in Michigan for switching away from coal has come from the state’s Republican governor, Rick Snyder, and from utilities themselves. Snyder has generally continued his support for steps to shift away from coal that began under his Democratic predecessor as governor, Jennifer Granholm. In 2015, Snyder said at an energy conference that "now is the time to look at a long-term transition away from coal," adding that because of the state’s natural gas infrastructure, "we're well positioned to actually have a fair amount of that coal demand go to natural gas." And Gerry Anderson, the chairman and CEO of DTE Energy, an electric utility that serves more than 2 million customers in the state, has written that "we plan to retire older, less efficient coal plants and build new, cleaner natural gas power plants over the next decade." Our ruling Trump said that "the Obama-Clinton war on coal has cost Michigan over 50,000 jobs." However, this claim is problematic on several levels. While the number matches one projection of how many potential jobs could be lost from the blockage of coal-fired plants, there’s a difference between actual jobs lost and potential future jobs lost. And the number cited -- an impossible-to-confirm projection based on broadly construed calculations released by a pro-coal group -- should be taken with a big grain of salt. Trump also ignores that market forces, not just environmental regulations, have driven many of the job losses in the coal sector, and he also ignores that Michigan Republican officials and utilities themselves -- not just the Obama administration -- have pushed the switch away from coal. We rate the claim False. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/5237e30a-995b-4c02-a36c-e160efe29dfa	None	Donald Trump	None	None	None	2016-08-09T16:50:56	2016-08-08	['Michigan']
pomt-11408	"Newspapers have framed this election as my fight against the Illinois mafia."	false	/illinois/statements/2018/mar/21/bruce-rauner/rauner-cites-own-remarks-proof-outside-support-ele/	Incumbent Gov. Bruce Rauner struck a number of familiar notes in his speech Tuesday night as he claimed a narrow primary victory over insurgent Republican challenger Jeanne Ives, talking about tax cuts, job growth and term limits for elected leaders. But the multi-millionaire Rauner also sought to frame his coming general election battle against Democratic nominee J.B. Pritzker as one pitting the interests of the little guy against entrenched political insiders allied with the billionaire Pritzker. Then Rauner threw in a new wrinkle to his standard line of attack. "Newspapers have framed this election as my fight against the Illinois mafia," he told the applauding crowd. "But it’s really the people versus the Illinois mafia." Rauner has long been free with tossing around incendiary terms to describe rivals, in particularly Illinois House Speaker Michael Madigan, whom the governor frequently lambastes as "corrupt." But this latest turn of phrase, which Rauner attributed not to himself but "newspapers," got us to wondering. Which newspapers? A look in the mirror So we reached out to his campaign for an answer. A spokesman quickly responded by emailing a link to a single opinion column published a few weeks ago in the Wall Street Journal titled, "Bruce Rauner vs. the Illinois ‘Mafia.’" In the piece, which represents the views of a single columnist and not the paper’s editorial board, Rauner pins Illinois’ problems squarely on Madigan. The Journal quotes Rauner referring to his archrival as "the mafia kingpin of Illinois" and then taking an additional swipe at Madigan for simultaneously serving as a powerful lawmaker and as a partner in a law firm specializing in property tax appeals. "It’s a mafia protection racket," Rauner said of Madigan’s dual roles. But the ‘mafia’ references in the headline and column come from Rauner’s own mouth, not from the impressions of the writer, who also goes on to note that: "Mr. Rauner sounds confident and plans to spend whatever it takes to make the election a referendum on reform versus the Madigan Mafia." Rauner campaign aides did not respond to our follow-up email asking whether they believed other newspapers had framed the election in similar terms. Our ruling After barely squeaking out a victory over a primary challenger, Gov. Bruce Rauner declared to supporters that, "Newspapers have framed this election as my fight against the Illinois mafia." Incendiary rhetoric has been a staple of Rauner speeches for years, but in upping the ante even more in his fight against Pritzker it appears the governor is also projecting his own words onto the thoughts of others. Newspapers, or more precisely one column in the Wall Street Journal, did not frame Rauner’s re-election fight in terms of a struggle with a mafia-like force. That is Rauner’s own characterization and he is simply quoting himself while seeking to attribute the observation to others. This dizzying feedback loop earns Rauner’s primary night claim a False.

pomt-07073	In the first 24 to 36 hours of the operation in Libya, "you saw $115 million go downrange because a Tomahawk cruise missile is a little over $1 million each."	mostly true	/florida/statements/2011/jun/27/allen-west/allen-west-says-military-spent-115-million-first-3/	War is hell. War is expensive. And we can attempt to quantify just how expensive it is. That's what Republican U.S. Rep. Allen West, an Army veteran who now represents part of Broward and Palm Beach counties, did in a June 20, 2011 interview on Fox News. West has been critical of the U.S. military actions in Libya launched in March. In a Miami Herald/St. Petersburg Times article on June 23, West was quoted as saying "We can't keep committing U.S. military to 'protect innocent civilians'; they're exhausted." He went into more detail on Fox News in response to a question about whether President Barack Obama would have gotten authorization from Congress to launch the operation, West responded: "Well, the thing is this. You have got to be able to explain what the mission is. And being 22 years in the United States military, we have seen three different missions being stated. First of all, we're going to protect innocent civilians. Kind of hard to do that from 30,000 feet. The next thing, we say we're going to go in and attack the military capability of (Moammar) Gadhafi. Really hard to do between the vehicles of the rebels and his vehicles. And now we want to take Moammar Gadhafi out of power. There are means by which we can restrict and constrain and kind of temper Moammar Gadhafi without coming back again and having a third combat operation. And you want to talk about the economics of this, in the first 24 to 36 hours, you saw $115 million go downrange because a Tomahawk cruise missile is a little over $1 million each." For this Truth-O-Meter item, we wondered if West got his numbers right. How much does the Tomahawk cruise missile cost and did we spend $115 million in the first 24 to 36 hours on missiles in Libya? And what if anything can we draw from that initial cost? Navy spokeswoman Amanda Greenberg told us in a June 23 interview that a Tomahawk cruise missile costs approximately $1.1 million. During the first 24 to 36 hours, 110 were fired by Coalition forces -- the majority by the U.S, she said. That math works out to about $121 million. West's spokeswoman Angela Sachitano directed us to a March 23 article in the National Journal which states: "On the first day of strikes alone, U.S.-led forces launched 112 long-range Tomahawk cruise missiles, which cost about $1 million to $1.5 million apiece, from ships stationed off the Libyan coast. That totaled $112 million to $168 million. Since those first strikes, U.S. and British forces have launched at least another 12 Tomahawk missiles. The Defense Department typically buys about 200 Tomahawks a year. While the military likely can put off buying new missiles for months, it will ultimately need to boost planned procurement rates to refill its stockpile." The tab in Libya continues to rise. That's a concern among Democrats and Republicans who have opposed the conflict that the Obama administration entered without seeking Congressional authority. Whether Obama violated the 1973 War Powers Resolution is the topic of a separate June 22, 2011 article on PolitiFact. The White House said in a report that as of June 3, the cost of the Libya operation was about $716 million. By Sept. 30, or 90 days into the conflict, that figure is expected to rise to about $1.1 billion. West's numbers about the first day and a half are clearly on target or close enough. But what do they mean? We interviewed four experts including Gordon Adams, a professor of foreign policy at American University who was associate director for national security and international affairs at the federal Office of Management and Budget in the 1990s. We also interviewed Zack Cooper, senior analyst at the nonpartisan Center for Strategic Budgetary Assessments who co-wrote a report in March about the costs of a no-fly zone in Libya published before the conflict started. Our additional experts were James Phillips, senior research fellow for Middle Eastern affairs at the conservative Heritage Foundation, and Michael O'Hanlon, a senior fellow in foreign policy at the left-leaning Brookings Institution. None of our experts quibbled with West's numbers. But some said the cost from the first day and half doesn't shed much light on the big picture. "His numbers are right but it doesn't mean anything," Adams said, because the government already bought those missiles and would ultimately use them somewhere. "We've already got them in the inventory -- it's not a new expenditure," Adams said. The government won't necessarily replace each Tomahawk missile that it used in Libya, Adams said. And that initial cost "doesn't tell you anything" about how much will ultimately be spent because we don't know how long the operation will continue or the operational tempo. Cooper's report estimated the initial and longer-term costs of creating different types of no-fly zones. For a limited no-fly zone covering mostly northern Libya, the report estimated upfront costs between $400 and $800 million and ultimately between $1.18 and $3.4 billion over six months. "The initial costs in these sorts of operations are typically higher in the first stages of the operations because more expensive munitions are being used and there are a high number of targets at the outset of combat operations," Cooper said in an e-mail. It's not helpful to compare the cost in the first day and a half in Libya to other conflicts, Cooper said. For some broader conflicts where the initial start-up time is at least multiple days and can include troops on the ground, it's harder to pinpoint the costs compared to the cost of dropping a certain number of bombs and multiplying the cost of each bomb. For other conflicts including some of the no-fly zones "they start small and sort of build so initial costs may be relatively small but costs over time may be large." "I think the Libya situation is anomolous," Cooper said. So can we draw any meaning from the costs in Libya the first 36 hours? "The cost of the first day or first couple of days was largely Tomahawk missiles and maybe some other munitions, but for the most part that's why it was so expensive," Cooper said. "The cost in the long term of a no-fly zone is typically fuel and operational costs so the two are very different. The upfront cost of imposing a no-fly zone are typically substantially higher than the week-to-week cost of flying planes above Libyan territory." On Fox News West said that the United States launched about $115 million worth of missiles within the first day or day and a half in Libya. That's about $6 million less than the figure we received from the Navy. And West didn't note that some of the Tomahawks were fired by U.S. allies. But still, close enough. But there are a couple of caveats -- namely, that the U.S. already had those missiles in stock, so it doesn't represent new spending. And initial costs in a military intervention are always higher, experts told us. We rate this claim Mostly True.	None	Allen West	None	None	None	2011-06-27T10:55:40	2011-06-20	['Libya']
pomt-11088	"When you tally up their representation in Congress and governorships, the Democrats almost have their lowest representation in about 100 years."	true	/punditfact/statements/2018/jun/15/fareed-zakaria/yes-democratic-party-nearly-its-weakest-point-cent/	While the Democratic Party held the White House for two terms during Barack Obama’s presidency, much of the country was turning a deeper shade of red. Republicans made dramatic down-ballot gains over the past decade, a trend that may have been overlooked somewhat given Democratic control of the executive branch for most of this time. But as the party vies to recapture the House and Senate from the GOP in upcoming midterm elections, the roots of Democrats’ recent losses are being reexamined. "Unless Democrats face up to this reality and devise a strategy to reverse this tidal wave of defeat, they might find themselves surprised one more time this November," said CNN’s Fareed Zakaria. "When you tally up their representation in Congress, state legislatures and governorships, the Democrats almost have their lowest representation in about 100 years." This stat, from the June 10 broadcast of his CNN show, was depicted in a graphic showing each of the two major parties’ power shifts since 1920 in Congress, governorships and state legislatures. (Source: CNN) The chart shows an ebb and flow of the parties’ power over roughly the past 100 years. The high-water mark of Democratic representation came during the New Deal era. But overall, the century is bookended with Democrats in positions of relative weakness. Zakaria is right: The Democratic Party is at nearly its weakest point in a century. Methodology Zakaria’s broader point was that center-left politics are in decline not only in the United States, but across the Western world. He cited a book by Barnard College Sheri Berman, "Why the Left Loses," which posits several explanatory factors: center-left parties field weak leaders; they shoulder the blame (fairly or not) when the post-World War II liberal order fails, as in the 2008 global financial crisis; and they’ve embraced a politics of identity that alienates large swaths of the electorate. A central premise to Zakaria’s argument was the statistic about Democrats’ near-historically low influence in Congress and at the state level. A CNN spokeswoman said Zakaria had been relying on a Real Clear Politics analysis of more than a century of data, as well as a piece in 538.com. We contacted the RCP researchers Sean Trende and David Byler (who is now with the Weekly Standard), who shared their dataset with us. Zakaria deviated slightly from their methodology (he omitted partisan data on presidents), but the down-ballot numbers seem to back up his point about Democrats’ waning power. "Zakaria’s chart doesn’t include presidential performance, which is included in our original metric," Trende said. "That wouldn’t, however, alter the basic conclusion, and his findings are a fair representation of our research." To establish their partisan power index, Trende and Byler devised a points system for Democrats’ and Republicans’ performance in five electoral categories: president, House, Senate, state legislatures and gubernatorial performance. They added the five metrics together for each party, at two-year intervals. The party with the higher number had more power relative to the other. Byler noted a couple caveats. For starters, the dataset ends at the 2016 election. Furthermore, the researchers made certain judgment calls that resulted in the index not tracking exactly with election results. For example, Janet Napolitano won the 2006 Arizona gubernatorial election, but left relatively soon after the 2008 election to join the Obama administration. That meant Jan Brewer, a Republican, was in office for much of 2009-11. Under the RCP index, we found three historical instances where Democrats held a weaker position, relative to Republicans, than they did following the 2016 election: in 1920, 1926 and 1928. Given Zakaria’s hedging — he said Democrats almost have their lowest representation in about 100 years — we think his claim passes muster. Congress The RCP data shows the Democrats’ Senate representation was weakest in 1920 during the Republican presidency of Warren G. Harding. At that point, the GOP held a 59-37 seat advantage — with Democrats holding 10 fewer seats than they do today. (Technically, Democrats currently hold 47 seats, though two Independent senators — Bernie Sanders of Vermont and Angus King of Maine — caucus with the Democrats, giving Republicans a razor-thin 51-seat majority.) See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com To get another view of the historical data, we turned to the Brookings Institution’s Vital Statistics on Congress, which tracks election results (again, the RCP data is not precisely pegged to election results). According to Brookings, there were nine other instances where Democrats held fewer Senate seats than they do today: 1921 (37), 1923 (43), 1925 (40), 1929 (39), 1947 (45), 1997 and 1999 (45 each), 2005 (44) and 2015 (44). As in the Senate, the 1920s were a rough decade for House Democrats. The party’s weakest showing in the House was in 1920, when Democrats held 131 seats to Republicans’ 303, according to RCP data. See Figure 2 on PolitiFact.com Brookings data shows six other instances when Democrats held fewer than the 193 seats they boast today. State legislatures At the state legislative level, Democrats have ceded enormous power to Republicans over the past decade. In 2008, Democrats controlled twice as many legislatures as the GOP (24-14). But Democrats’ fortunes began to reverse with their 2010 midterm "shellacking" (to borrow Obama’s phrase). See Figure 3 on PolitiFact.com John Mahoney, a policy specialist at the National Conference of State Legislatures, said it was accurate to say Democrats are at near-historical lows in this arena. "There are currently 3,125 Ds serving in state legislatures, which is the lowest since 1928 when there were 3,057 Ds serving," Mahoney said. "The lowest ever (since 1900) Democratic representation in the states was in 1920 when only 2,545 Ds were serving in state legislatures." Governor’s mansion A look at Democrats’ standing in governships over the past decade shows a similarly declining trend, placing the party in one of its weakest positions over the past century. Democrats now hold 16 governors mansions, compared to 33 controlled by Republicans. (Gov. Bill Walker of Alaska is an Independent.) See Figure 4 on PolitiFact.com According to RCP data, the only time Democrats had a weaker standing in the past 100 years was in 1920, when they controlled a mere 14 governorships. One thing to remember As we have noted in the past, the Democratic decline under Obama that produced the current low point was unusually big, but it was hardly unprecedented. Since World War II, no two-term president (or presidential tag team) has ever gained Senate seats, House seats, governorships, or state legislative chambers over an eight-year period. Rather, every single presidency has suffered substantial losses in each of those categories over the past seven decades. There has literally been no upside in down-ballot races for presidents as far back as Franklin D. Roosevelt. Our ruling Zakaria said, "When you tally up their representation in Congress, state legislatures and governorships, the Democrats almost have their lowest representation in about 100 years." Democrats wield less power than Republicans in each of these offices. In the 1920s, they had an even weaker standing relative to the GOP than they do today. But Zakaria hedged his bets by saying Democrats almost have their lowest representation in about 100 years — and the numbers appear to back him up. We rate this True.

pomt-03557	"Forty-six cents of every dollar" Ohio could get for Medicaid expansion "is going to come from China or some other country that doesn’t like us very much."	false	/ohio/statements/2013/may/22/ron-maag/rep-ron-maag-says-46-percent-medicaid-expansion-mo/	Free money from Washington sure sounds enticing. But State Rep. Ron Maag, a Southwest Ohio Republican, says he doesn’t believe it’s really free. That’s one reason Maag does not want Ohio to expand Medicaid, the joint federal-state healthcare program for low-income Americans. The expansion money would come from the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, or Obamacare, providing states with Medicaid cash to enroll residents earning up to 138 percent of the poverty level. The federal government would provide full funding for the first three years, and then 90 percent. Besides skepticism about how much more Ohio might ultimately have to cover, Maag, of Warren County, doubts the federal government can really afford its portion, either. "Forty-six cents of every dollar that we would be getting from Washington, D.C., is going to come from China or some other country that doesn’t like us very much," he said at an Ohio House Finance and Appropriations Committee hearing on April 12. Plenty of Ohio Republicans have doubts about expanding Medicaid, but Maag’s statement stood out because it sounded contrary to federal assessments about the program’s financing. So we asked Maag to explain his claim. He told us in a telephone interview that the federal government already borrows 46 cents of every dollar it spends. He based that on a Congressional Budget Office, or CBO, report issued in December. The CBO report that Maag cited was a monthly review that showed the amount of money the government had spent (the outlays) so far in the fiscal year; the amount of revenue it took in (chiefly from taxes), and the difference between the two. The difference was in the negative column. That means the government had a deficit and must borrow to cover it. Divide the deficit by the outlays and you get the figure Maag stated -- 46 cents of every dollar spent as of that moment was deficit spending. That is not a projection, Maag said. "It’s an absolute." It was, at least, last December. And the percentage figure, 46, was high, prompting the Washington Times and several other media outlets to report it. But this CBO budget report covered a relatively narrow time frame, only two months. What would happen if you looked at a broader period, using the most current CBO report, issued May 7? Or the April report that was issued a week before Maag spoke? The deficit figure would change -- or, rather, it has changed. The CBO monthly review issued on April 5 provided figures for the first six months of the current fiscal year. They showed a lower level of deficits: 34 cents for every dollar of federal spending. Why had the deficit figure gone down? Part of it was due to more tax activity from an improving economy. Revenues were about 12 percent higher than for the same period in 2012 and spending was 3 percent lower, the CBO said. This was not a fluke. Subsequent CBO reports have noted the same thing: As the economy has improved, tax revenues have gone up and deficits down. OK, so the deficits are shrinking and Maag had not yet read the latest monthly CBO figures. (Doesn’t everyone in the Ohio General Assembly?) Let’s put aside the exact figure, for it is still a deficit. What about Maag’s broader point -- that Medicaid expansion under Obamacare would result in more deficit spending? That is not what the CBO -- the same nonpartisan office whose work Maag mentioned in defending part of this claim -- projects. The CBO has examined this several times, working with the bipartisan Joint Committee on Taxation. Obamacare has costs, chiefly the cost of expanding health coverage with Medicaid and with subsidies for individuals and small employers who lack insurance, cannot afford it and cannot qualify for Medicaid. But it also has savings. Some of the savings are supposed to come from reducing the amount of money the federal government now pays to hospitals to care for the uninsured. In Ohio alone, the government will pay hospitals $7.4 billion less over the next 10 years, according to testimony to state lawmakers from Mike Abrams, president and CEO of the Ohio Hospital Association. Additionally, the federal government will get money from taxes on high-premium or "Cadillac" health care policies, from taxes on medical device sales, from penalties on employers who fail to provide insurance and, according to projections, from cuts and efficiencies geared to slow the growth rate of Medicare, the federal program for seniors. When the Affordable Care Act passed in 2010, the CBO said the net savings would reduce deficits over 10 years by $143 billion. The CBO has taken a few additional swipes at this, and each time its projections show deficit reduction. When asked last year to examine what would happen if Obamacare were repealed, the CBO said deficits would grow by $109 billion between 2012 and 2022. Even though government costs would go down if Obamacare were repealed, so would the revenue and savings built into the health care bill. So we circle back to Maag’s claim that "Forty-six cents of every dollar that we would be getting from Washington, D.C. would come from China or some other country that doesn’t like us very much." His number was wrong and out of date. The CBO, whose projections both parties rely on, says deficits will go down, not up. We need not take up the last part of his sentence -- that the money would come from countries like China or others who don’t like the United States very much. But for the record, the Pentagon said last year that it does not view China’s holding of United States debt as a threat. Maag’s instincts tell him he is right. But the facts, projections and law, as they exist today, do not support his claim. We rate it False.	None	Ron Maag	None	None	None	2013-05-22T15:58:40	2013-04-12	['China', 'Ohio']
pomt-09798	"Every other democracy in the world has a health care system that covers everybody, and we don't."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/sep/15/howard-dean/dean-says-us-only-democracy-without-universal-heal/	Supporters of health care reform have often said health coverage in the United States lags behind other countries. On the Sept. 13 edition of NBC's Meet the Press , former Vermont Gov. Howard Dean said the United States should meet the standards of its international peers. Dean, who just stepped down after serving as chairman of the Democratic National Committee, said that "America can do anything. Every other democracy in the world has a health care system that covers everybody, and we don't. Of course we can do this. How ridiculous." But is he right that the United States is alone among democracies? No. It is true that most, if not all, industrialized democracies in Western Europe have systems that experts consider universal coverage, as do wealthier countries such as Japan, Australia, New Zealand and Canada. But other democracies fall short, according to international statistics and a half-dozen experts we spoke with. While dozens of countries are classified as democracies, we chose to examine a few that are large and have been politically stable in recent years. Here's the lowdown on their degree of health coverage: -- India. In the cities, and especially for families with means, the medical care ranks among the best in the world. But hundreds of millions of Indians are desperately poor, and about three-quarters live in rural villages. For these Indians, health care is sporadic and substandard. "In theory, India has a publicly financed and publicly provided health care delivery system, aside from its large private sector, that is available at heavily subsidized rates to everyone," said Ajay Mahal, an international health economist at Harvard's School of Public Health. "Thus, one could say that it does have a health system that 'covers' everybody. In practice, however, at least at primary health care facilities in rural areas, doctors and health workers are often absent from work. Drugs tend to be unavailable in many public facilities and there are long lines to contend with at public hospitals. This leads to lots of people opting for private care — and for that they have to pay out of pocket. In this sense you could say that the system does not cover everybody." -- Mexico. The United States' southern neighbor has a constitution that guarantees universal health care, and observers credit the Mexican government with launching Seguro Popular, a federal program that targets the uninsured. For better-off Mexicans, health insurance and facilities are similar to what is found in richer nations. But in practice, the Mexican system falls short of universal coverage. The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, a group of wealthy countries that includes Mexico, reported that in 2007, 65.7 percent of Mexicans had either public or private health insurance. All other OECD countries — except for Turkey (see below) and the United States — either reached 100 percent or came very close to doing so. David C. Warner, a professor of health and social policy at the University of Texas who has studied health care in Mexico, said that "in reality, I would say it falls short" of universal coverage. Mexicans are "guaranteed public health clinics and hospitals, but those tend to be fairly spotty." -- Turkey. The other OECD nation besides the United States to fall short of full coverage is Turkey. The most recent statistics, from 2003, show that 67.2 percent of Turks were covered. A 2008 report by the U.S. Library of Congress found that "the rural population is poorly served by the health care system" and that "workers in Turkey’s large informal economic sector generally lack health coverage." For the past six years, the governing party has been implementing a plan to broaden coverage, so the number has likely risen. "Turkey is in transition to make health care universal," said Mustafa Younis, a health economist at Jackson State University who has studied the Turkish system. A number of other large democratic countries have struggled with carrying out their stated promises to provide universal coverage. In South Africa and the Philippines, for instance, widespread poverty, insufficient health budgets and a shaky medical infrastructure — especially in rural areas — have posed steep challenges, experts say. We called Dean to ask about his comment. A spokeswoman said that the former governor "simply misspoke. He meant to say, as he has for years, that every other industrialized democracy" has universal coverage. If Dean had said that, he'd probably be right. But on Meet the Press , he didn't, so we rate his statement False.	None	Howard Dean	None	None	None	2009-09-15T18:27:53	2009-09-13	['None']
pomt-13026	Says Donald Trump "won more counties than any candidate on our side since Ronald Reagan."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/dec/04/mike-pence/mike-pence-says-donald-trump-won-most-counties-rep/	With a split in the 2016 Electoral College and popular votes, there’s been an unusual amount of jockeying this year over how to frame the Election Day results. On the Dec. 4, 2016, edition of NBC’s Meet the Press, Vice President-elect Mike Pence used the yardstick of counties won to explain why Donald Trump’s victory was a watershed. "To be around Donald Trump, as you know, having known him for a number of years, is to be around a man of boundless energy from literally the day after the election," he said, "a historic election where he won 30 out of 50 states (and) more counties than any candidate on our side since Ronald Reagan." Is this correct? It is, though election experts say it speaks to longtime Republican dominance in rural areas. A closer look at the numbers We were able to secure statistics for counties won by each presidential candidate from Dave Leip, creator of the indispensable "Atlas of U.S. Presidential Elections" website. The following chart shows the breakdown in counties won by each party’s nominee going back to 1984, which was Reagan’s last election as well as the one in which he won every state except one (Minnesota). Two housekeeping notes: The data for 2016 is preliminary, and Alaska doesn’t calculate vote data by borough, which is that state’s equivalent of a county. Election Republican counties won Democratic counties won Independent counties won 2016 2,623 489 0 2012 2,420 693 0 2008 2,238 875 0 2004 2,530 583 0 2000 2,397 659 0 1996 1,587 1,526 0 1992 1,582 1,519 15 1988 2,295 820 0 1984 2,781 334 0 So Pence is on target that the number of counties won by Trump exceeds the number of counties won by every Republican presidential candidate since Reagan in 1984. For a more visual look, here are maps showing the counties won by the parties in each of those elections. Note that the 2016 map, from the Washington Post, uses the now-traditional Democratic blue-Republican red color scheme. 2016 The rest of the maps, from Leip's website, use blue coloring for Republican counties and red coloring for Democratic counties. (For the record, Leip started using his coloring code in 1994, before the current version became standard; he says that changing every map on his site would require an enormous time commitment.) 2012 2008 2004 2000 1996 1992 1988 1984 Trump receives credit from electoral specialists for expanding the Republican footprint, notably in places that had previously backed Barack Obama. According to a calculation by Time magazine, Trump won 220 counties that had voted for Obama in 2012, while Hillary Clinton took far fewer -- 17 -- that had gone for Mitt Romney, the 2012 GOP nominee. And Trump outperformed Romney’s vote share in 2,728 counties, compared to just 383 where Clinton outperformed Obama. But the places where Clinton performed better than Obama did were almost always in much more populous counties. According to Time’s calculations, the counties where Clinton gained ground on Obama had a median of 75,554 voters in 2016. The comparable figure for the counties where Trump exceeded Romney’s performance was 9,905 voters. So the median Clinton-trending county was more than seven times bigger than the median Trump-trending county. The divide doesn’t stop at population. Mark Muro and Sifan Liu of the Brookings Institution crunched the numbers on the overall economic output of Clinton and Trump counties. Their finding? Clinton’s comparatively tiny number of counties "encompassed a massive 64 percent of America’s economic activity," compared to 36 percent for Trump’s much larger stable of counties. Here’s a graphical representation of what they found, with Clinton counties in blue and Trump counties in red, and each county’s rectangle scaled to the size of the output in that county: "Here you can see very clearly that with the exceptions of the Phoenix and Fort Worth areas and a big chunk of Long Island, Clinton won every large-sized county economy in the country," the authors wrote. "Trumpland consists of hundreds and hundreds of tiny low-output locations that comprise the non-metropolitan hinterland of America, along with some suburban and exurban metro counties." All of this illustrates a general pattern for Democrats in recent election cycles: They have run strongly in populous and economically growing urban and suburban areas, but poorly in lightly populated rural areas. This has been true for the entire period we’re looking at -- in fact, Bill Clinton never managed to win more counties during his two victories in the 1990s -- but the partisan disparity has been growing steadily. And the pattern reached a new apogee with the Trump vs. Clinton race. This helps explain why Clinton has so far won 2.6 million more votes than Trump did -- almost 2 percentage points more -- while losing so many counties. "Loving County, Texas, has a population of 82, while California’s Los Angeles County has over 9.8 million," said Costas Panagopoulos, a Fordham University political scientist. "The number of counties won is not necessarily a meaningful indicator, absent any consideration of the population of these counties." Seth Masket, a University of Denver political scientist, agreed. "Partisanship increasingly correlates with urbanism," he said. "There are a lot more rural counties than urban ones, so I'd expect Republicans to be winning more and more counties over time. So the claim that the GOP is winning more counties is possibly an interesting reflection on residential living patterns, but it doesn't really reflect what the voters wanted or what the government has a mandate to address." Our ruling Pence said that Trump "won more counties than any candidate on our side since Ronald Reagan." The electoral results leave little doubt that Trump expanded Republican success compared to Romney’s baseline in many corners of the country. However, it’s important not to overstate the importance of the statistic Pence cited. Clinton may have won fewer counties overall, but the ones she did win tended to be much more populous and economically dynamic. The statement is accurate, but it needs an asterisk, so we rate it Mostly True. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/ea7c6f37-927c-4edc-9de7-f78fd53257aa	None	Mike Pence	None	None	None	2016-12-04T17:54:39	2016-12-04	['Ronald_Reagan']
pomt-09269	Says the American public "overwhelmingly opposed" Democratic-steered health care plan.	half-true	/texas/statements/2010/apr/29/kay-bailey-hutchison/sen-kay-bailey-hutchison-says-democrats-passed-hea/	U.S. Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison, speaking for Republicans in response to President Barack Obama’s weekly radio address on Saturday, spiced a call for keeping watch over the nation’s financial sector with a ‘plaint about Democrats’ stewardship of recently adopted health care legislation. "Americans are troubled," Hutchison said, "by the way Democrats forced their health care bill on the public that overwhelmingly opposed it." We missed the whips and chains in the health-care fight and wondered if Hutchison imagined things, considering key actions took place by majority votes. That said, we're setting aside this part of her statement as partisan hyperbole. For this article, we’re focusing on Hutchison’s claim that the American public "overwhelmingly opposed" the health care plan. PolitiFact.com previously looked at references to public opinion and the health care legislation. In February, it found Mostly True a statement by Sen. Jon Kyl, R-Arizona, that 75 percent of the American people "have said either don't do anything (on health care) or start over." And in March, PolitiFact.com rated as Half True Democratic U.S. Rep. John Yarmuth's statement that polling showed almost 40 percent of Americans opposed the health-care plan because they didn’t think it went far enough. Responding to our inquiry, Hutchison spokesman Jeff Sadosky told us that from late April 2009 to late April this year, telephone calls and letters mostly sent by Texans to the senior Texas senator ran heavily against "Obama’s health care" approach. More than 18,100 callers were opposed while 4,830 were in favor; about 75 percent of more than 350,000 letters that Hutchison received were against the reform, Sadosky said. Still, signals from Texas constituents don't necessarily demonstrate national sentiment. We turned next to polls taken before and after the final congressional action, which was followed in late March by Obama signing the plan into law. According to almost every poll we found, more Americans opposed action than favored it as the debate reached its climax. According to a Gallup poll taken March 4-7, weeks before the final votes, 48 percent of Americans said they would advise their representative to vote against an Obama health-care reform measure with 45 percent saying they’d advise a favorable vote. At the time, Gallup said the result confirmed "the generally divided nature of public opinion on health care legislation." Seeking to gauge whether Americans' opposition was overwhelming, as Hutchison puts it, we reviewed summaries of polls compiled by the non-partisan Kaiser Family Foundation, a reliable font of information on health care. From our sampling: A CNN/Opinion Research Corporation poll taken March 19-21 asked individuals if they generally favored or opposed the health care plan then awaiting final action. The tally: 39 percent in favor, 59 percent against and 2 percent with no opinion. A Bloomberg poll taken those same days found 38 percent of respondents in favor, 50 percent opposed and 12 percent not sure. Some other polls showed a narrower approval/disapproval gap. A Quinnipiac University poll taken March 22-23 found 40 percent mostly approving of the health care system changes just passed by Congress, 49 percent mostly disapproving and 11 percent not knowing or answering. In a CBS News poll taken March 18-23, 42 percent said they approved of the "current health care reform" measure, 46 percent were opposed and 12 percent said they did not know or declined to answer. And a poll taken March 23-26 by The Washington Post found 46 percent of respondents supporting the changes to the health care system just enacted by Congress and Obama with 46 percent opposed. A Gallup poll taken in early April showed a near-even break between Americans saying passage of the plan was a bad thing and Americans saying it was good. Forty-nine percent of individuals polled April 8-11 said it was a bad thing with 45 percent saying it was good. Generally, Gallup writes, "over the past year, Americans have been remarkably stable in their assessments of the bill, with neither supporters nor opponents able to generate sustained majority agreement with their position." Doubts remain high in Texas, according to an April 14 telephone poll by Rasmussen Reports. Sixty-seven percent of surveyed likely voters favor a proposal to repeal the health care plan to stop it from taking effect, with 28 percent opposing such a move. Where does all this leave Hutchison’s claim of overwhelming opposition at the time lawmakers acted? Certainly, many Texans clamored against approval. And national polls show more Americans opposed the action than supported it. But Hutchison overreaches by calling that opposition overwhelming. We rate Hutchison’s statement as Half True.

pomt-01576	Says U.S. House candidate Carlos Curbelo "supported ending the Medicare guarantee."	false	/florida/statements/2014/sep/09/joe-garcia/does-republican-carlos-curbelo-support-ending-medi/	U.S. Rep. Joe Garcia, D-Miami, portrays his Republican challenger Carlos Curbelo as out of touch with middle-class residents in his South Florida district when it comes to issues such as Medicare benefits. A Web ad repeatedly shows Curbelo in a TV interview saying "if anybody has a complaint, file it," while the ad lists a litany of attacks on Curbelo. (That quote is unrelated to Medicare and relates to a situation involving Curbelo’s work as a lobbyist.) Narrator: "When Curbelo supported ending the Medicare guarantee? Curbelo: "If anyone has a complaint, file it." Here we will fact-check whether Curbelo "supported ending the Medicare guarantee" -- an attack that could draw the attention of senior voters in the district that spans Miami to Key West. Paul Ryan’s proposals for Medicare The ad provides no explanation about what it would mean to end the Medicare guarantee or why Garcia claims that is Curbelo’s view. Curbelo is a Miami-Dade school board member who has never served in Congress so he hasn’t voted on any Medicare plan. Garcia’s attack relates to Curbelo’s statement in April 2014 about a GOP budget plan by U.S. Rep. Paul Ryan, R-Wis. Ryan, the House budget chairman, has included proposals to overhaul Medicare in his past few budget proposals with some changes along the way. When the Miami Herald asked Curbelo in April about whether he supported Ryan’s plan in response to a Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee attack, Curbelo said, "I would vote for any budget that helps create jobs and rewards hard work, protects Medicare for seniors, and stops immorally piling debt on my generation and on my daughters' generation. While I have not fully reviewed this budget I'm inclined to support it." So what did the DCCC mean about ending the Medicare "guarantee"? The clearest -- and least controversial -- explanation of how Medicare is a guarantee is that once you turn 65, you get Medicare, no questions asked. That’s been the case since Medicare was established in 1965. Medicare is structured as a defined-benefit plan rather than a defined-contribution plan. That means it specifies the benefits provided, rather than letting benefits depend on the amount of money paid into the system. But the federal government doesn’t guarantee that it will pay for every possible service or treatment -- Medigap insurance plans have emerged to pay for the procedures that Medicare doesn’t cover. And Congress and the president can change what is covered under Medicare. The Affordable Care Act makes changes to Medicare to reduce future growth of the program. Ryan has released multiple versions of his Medicare plan the past few years. The plan Ryan released this year advocates reforming Medicare into a "premium support" program in which, starting in 2024, every new beneficiary would go into the premium-support system, but they will be able to choose whether their premium-support payment goes to help pay for a private plan or a traditional fee-for-service plan. (Critics refer to this as a voucher plan, and it does have some similarities.) A spokesman for Ryan said the premium support payment would be pegged to the average bid. For those who were 55 or older in 2013, they would remain in the traditional Medicare system. Ryan also raises the eligibility from age 65 to 67. Ryan’s proposal to overhaul Medicare has not gone far because it lacks support in the Democratic-controlled Senate. The ‘guarantee’ of Medicare Simply saying that Ryan’s plan is "ending the Medicare guarantee" is a misleading overstatement. If we talk about the "Medicare guarantee" simply as seniors getting Medicare when they hit a certain age, they are still guaranteed to get it. "It is a fundamental change to Medicare, but saying that it ends the guarantee is too far, because everyone would still get some kind of insurance," said Massachusetts Institute of Technology economist Jonathan Gruber, who has advised Republican Mitt Romney and President Barack Obama on health care matters. Michael Tanner, a health care expert at the libertarian Cato Institute, said that under Ryan’s plan Medicare "is liable to be a smaller benefit, but it still is going to be a universal benefit. While it's going to be a smaller benefit, so is President Obama’s." Some Medicare experts we interviewed argued that it is unclear what types of services would remain guaranteed. "The Ryan plan keeps changing, lacks key details, and has multiple dimensions, making it hard to evaluate," said Jonathan Oberlander, a health policy professor at the University of North Carolina. Today, Medicare has a host of services that are covered including a number of days in the hospital or nursing home and covers specified tests and procedures. "These are ‘guaranteed.’ What would be covered under an insurance plan that people might buy with a voucher is not specified in law," said Henry J. Aaron, a senior fellow at Brookings Institute. "Benefits could erode over time if the voucher was not increased as fast as medical costs rise, a standard feature of many voucher plans, unless people ponied up additional premium payments that might rise rapidly if they want to maintain breadth of coverage." At this point, Ryan’s plan leaves advocates with questions. "I don’t know for certain if there would be guaranteed core benefits or if the benefits that are guaranteed now would have to be in those plans," said Judith Stein, executive director of the Center for Medicare Advocacy. "It would be substantially different." What Curbelo says Curbelo told PolitiFact Florida that he is against a voucher or premium-support plan for Medicare. "I’ve never supported the voucher concept," Curbelo said. "I don’t think we need to do that. I think we can preserve Medicare as it exists today through other reforms." Curbelo calls for "eliminating the rampant fraud in fee-for-service, adjusting the eligibility age to account for longer lifespan, and potentially, means testing," his campaign spokesman Wadi Gaitan told PolitiFact Florida. Curbelo, however, doesn’t deny that he said he supported Ryan’s overall budget proposal, though he told PolitiFact Florida he disagrees with the premium-support plan within it. "Given a choice between the GOP budget and the Democrats’ budget, he would have supported the GOP budget," Gaitan said. Accusing a Republican of wanting to get rid of the "Medicare guarantee" is a common Democratic tactic this year -- in fact, Garcia’s attack on Curbelo is similar to one in April by the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee. (The DCCC has used a similar attack on U.S. Rep Steve Southerland, R-Fla., and the Senate Democratic Campaign Committee has used it against GOP Senate candidate Joni Ernst in Iowa.) This Democratic talking point is the latest variation on the Democratic line that "Republicans voted to end Medicare," which PolitiFact rated Lie of the Year in 2011. Our ruling Garcia said "Curbelo supported ending the Medicare guarantee." The Democrats are hanging this claim on a very weak thread: when asked about Ryan’s budget proposal which includes a Medicare overhaul Curbelo said, "While I have not fully reviewed this budget I'm inclined to support it." That statement sheds no light on Curbelo’s views on changing Medicare. Ryan’s plan would change Medicare but it wouldn’t end the guarantee that seniors get it when they hit a certain age. And Curbelo says he wants to reform Medicare in other ways that don’t involve Ryan’s premium-support plan. We rate this claim False.

pomt-12076	Says Aaron Rodgers "is not the highest tax rate payer" in Wisconsin, it's "the single mom getting 24 grand in benefits with two kids who will lose 80 cents on the dollar if she goes and takes a job."	mostly false	/wisconsin/statements/2017/sep/01/paul-ryan/paul-ryan-says-single-mom-who-takes-job-not-packer/	A Dominican nun took the microphone at a CNN town hall in Racine, Wis. with U.S. House Speaker Paul Ryan, noted that they are both Catholics, and said to him: I’d like to ask you how you see yourself upholding the church’s social teaching that has the idea that God is always on the side of the poor and dispossessed. The Janesville Republican responded, in part, by referring to the Green Bay Packers’ star quarterback -- and arguing that welfare programs need to be reformed so that they don’t discourage work. Alluding to high tax rates he had criticized earlier in the Aug. 21, 2017 forum, Ryan said: I was telling you about these successful small businesses in Wisconsin -- they’ve got a 44.6 percent tax rate. That’s not the highest tax rate payer. I mean, Aaron Rodgers -- who deserves every salary -- is not the highest tax rate payer in this state. You know who it is? It’s the single mom getting 24 grand in benefits with two kids who would lose 80 cents on the dollar if she goes and takes a job. We have to fix that. Ryan essentially repeated the claim three days later while visiting Boeing in Washington State, comparing the aerospace giant and its corporate tax rate to the same single mother. He has also made nearly the same claim in the past, including at least twice in 2016. An unemployed single parent on public assistance who takes a job doesn’t suddenly start paying an income tax rate of 80 percent. And though Ryan has a point, the example he gives is rare, not common. Tax rates For 2017, Rodgers’ contract with the Packers pays him a base salary of $12.55 million. That alone puts him in the income brackets with the highest tax rates: 7.65 percent for Wisconsin, which applies to taxable incomes over $244,750 39.6 percent for federal, for taxable incomes of $418,401 and over That means Rodgers’ marginal rate -- the amount paid on the last dollar of income -- is a total rate of 47.25 percent. (The state rate plus the federal one.) So, what happens to the unemployed single mother, in Ryan’s scenario, who takes a job? Marginal tax rates Ryan spokesman Ian Martorana told us Ryan’s reference was not to the income tax rate paid by the single mother, but rather her effective marginal tax rate -- which takes into account public benefits that are lost as a result of an increase in income. Think of losing benefits as a result of taking a job as a tax. Ryan argues that by taking a job, the woman in his example would lose 80 cents in benefits for every $1 in income earned from taking a job. That would be a marginal tax rate of 80 percent. Experts told us that wouldn’t be the highest marginal tax rate anyone pays, but it would be among the highest. The problem is, Ryan’s statement suggests the 80 percent rate is relatively common. Experts told us it’s possible, but very rare, that a single unemployed parent could collect $24,000 a year in public benefits. She likely would need to receive relatively uncommon housing assistance in addition to food stamps, Medicaid and other benefits. The experts also said such a person would be hit with what amounts to an 80 percent tax rate only if she takes a job within a narrow income range above the poverty level -- not, for example, if the job pays minimum wage. A 2015 research paper Ryan’s office cited to us from the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office does not provide marginal tax rates for a single parent like the one Ryan described. However, for a single parent with one child -- and only within a narrow income range -- the marginal tax rate for 2016 averaged 75 percent Another source cited by Ryan, 2015 testimony to Congress from the nonprofit Urban Institute, also said marginal tax rates can reach 75 percent. But that occurs among relatively few people -- poverty-level workers who not only receive benefits such as food stamps and health insurance, but much less common housing assistance, and then begin earning higher incomes within a narrow range above the poverty level. In contrast, an unemployed person who takes a job would almost never face an 80 percent marginal tax rate, experts told us. That’s because while a newly employed person might lose some benefits by becoming employed, she would gain benefits from earned income and child care tax credits that come with taking a job. Other data For example, in a 2014 paper, the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a left-leaning think tank, argued that a single mother of two is better off by taking a job, even if it pays only $12,000 per year. She would lose some food stamps and have to pay income taxes. But by gaining the earned income and child tax credits, "that $12,000 job leads to a $16,630 increase in income," according to the paper. Only in narrow circumstances -- with an income of less than $29,000 and receiving "an unusual combination of government benefits" -- would the marginal tax rate for a single mother of two exceed 80 percent, according to a 2016 paper by the center. "In the overwhelming majority of cases, in fact, adults in poverty are significantly better off if they get a job, work more hours, or receive a wage hike," that paper said. At the same time, even if marginal tax rates don’t reach 80 percent for most lower-income people, they are perceived as a problem. The paper from the nonpartisan CBO says "when marginal tax rates are high, people tend to respond to the smaller financial gain from employment by working fewer hours, altering the intensity of their work, or not working at all." And Wisconsin Taxpayers Alliance president Todd Berry told us: "It is a real problem for anyone moving up the income scale from poverty, because so many of these programs are income-conditioned. The main point to be made here is how these programs are designed can create powerful disincentives" to work. Our rating Ryan says Aaron Rodgers "is not the highest tax rate payer" in Wisconsin, it's "the single mom getting 24 grand in benefits with two kids who will lose 80 cents on the dollar if she goes and takes a job." There’s some mixing of apples and oranges here. The reference to Rodgers is for the actual highest rate he would pay for income taxes. With regard to the single mother, Ryan is referring to her marginal tax rate -- how much in public benefits she would lose by taking a job. Ryan is correct that it’s possible for the woman he describes to lose 80 cents in benefits for every $1 in income earned -- an 80 percent marginal tax rate. But that occurs in very rare cases where the mother would be receiving a higher than typical set of public benefits and would take a job within a narrow income range above the poverty level. The vast majority of lower income people aren’t hit with a marginal tax rate as high as 80 percent, although even lower rates are considered strong disincentives to work. And advocates for the poor say the unemployed generally are better off financially by taking a job, even if they lose some public assistance. For a statement that contains some element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression, our rating is Mostly False. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com A footnote Ryan had been under criticism for not holding town halls in his southern Wisconsin district that were open to the public. We rated as Mostly True a claim from Randy Bryce, a Democrat who is running for Ryan’s seat in 2018, that Ryan had not done a public town hall in the district for more than 600 days. Ryan had turned to telephone town halls and events held in workplaces, which had limited public access. The CNN event was something of a hybrid: members of the public could apply to CNN to attend, but it was not like a traditional town hall held in a public building that anyone could enter. In Racine, Ryan drew headlines for criticizing remarks made by President Donald Trump about racial violence nine days earlier in Charlottesville, Va. But a portion of the CNN town hall was spent discussing taxes.

pomt-14505	"In Ohio, more than half the providers of safe and legal abortion have had to shut down" since Gov. John Kasich took office in 2011.	half-true	/ohio/statements/2016/feb/22/cecile-richards/planned-parenthoods-ceo-says-half-ohios-abortion-c/	Cecile Richards, the president of Planned Parenthood, told a crowd of women in Los Angeles how she really feels about the idea of Gov. John Kasich, R-Ohio, winning the presidential election: "It would be a complete and utter disaster." She continued, "Gov. Kasich has come off as a moderate, only by comparison to Ted Cruz and Donald Trump, but it’s really important to know in Ohio, more than half the providers of safe and legal abortion have had to shut down. He signed 17 separate bills to restrict reproductive access in the state." We looked more closely to find out how many of Ohio’s abortion providers had closed, and whether it could be attributed to Kasich’s leadership. Ohio’s chapter of NARAL Pro-Choice America has been keeping tabs on clinic closings and openings. They say that since 2011, Kasich’s first year in office, eight of the 16 surgical abortion clinics have closed or stopped performing abortions. A new provider in Akron opened in the summer of 2015, bringing the total number of functioning surgical abortion clinics in the state to nine. PolitiFact Ohio confirmed NARAL’s tally of closings in Ohio, in chronological order: February 2011, the Mahoning Valley Women’s Center, Youngstown June 2012, Capital Care Network, Columbus April 2013, Capital Care Network, Akron October 2013, Center for Choice, Toledo October 2013, Cleveland Center for Women’s Health June 2014, Cleveland Surgi-Center August 2014, Complete Healthcare for Women, Columbus August 2014, Women’s Medical Center of Cincinnati They key legislation that caused at least four of the clinics to close was passed in Ohio’s 2013 budget (HB 59). Kasich signed into law regulations that equate to a Catch-22 for abortion providers. HB 59 requires all ambulatory surgical facilities to have a transfer agreement with a local hospital to admit patients in case of emergency. At the same time, the law prohibits public hospitals from entering into transfer agreements with abortion providers. H.B. 59, 130th Gen. Assemb., Reg. Sess. (Ohio 2013) In 2013, the New York Times wrote about Ohio’s changing climate for women’s reproductive rights. "Ohio has become a laboratory for what anti-abortion leaders call the incremental strategy — passing a web of rules designed to push the hazy boundaries of Supreme Court guidelines without flagrantly violating them." Michael Gonidakis, president of Ohio Right to Life, put it more succinctly last year, when the Columbus Dispatch quoted him as saying, "The goal is to end abortion." The transfer agreement legislation shut down Toledo’s Center for Choice; the center was unable to get a transfer agreement from a private hospital after legislation outlawed their agreement with the public University of Toledo Medical Center. Today, their phone number forwards calls to a clinic in Michigan, the next-closest location for women seeking surgical abortions in the area. Likewise, the Women’s Medical Center of Cincinnati was denied an exception to their transfer agreement from the Ohio Health Department and went to court to fight the decision in Hamilton County. The center lost in court and closed in August 2014. A representative at Cleveland’s Surgi-Center told PolitiFact that when their location’s lease was up in July 2014, they had to move, which meant applying for a new ambulatory surgical center license through the Ohio Department of Health. "Knowing all the problems other clinics were having," the Surgi-Center stopped performing abortions. They still provide reproductive health services like STD screening and birth control. The Cleveland Center for Women’s Health closed in 2013 and relocated to Detroit, Mich., where there are fewer regulations for clinics that do abortions. The other four shuttered abortion providers closed for reasons that are not as directly tied to state regulations. The Mahoning Valley center in Youngstown closed as a business decision, according to NARAL. The Capital Care Network location in Akron closed after state inspectors identified safety violations that temporarily halted services, and the provider opted to close rather than correct the issues. In Columbus, Capital Care merged with Founders’ Women’s Health, another abortion provider. Finally, according to NARAL, the doctors with Complete Healthcare for Women, who still provide complete women’s health care services other than surgical abortions, never gave an explanation for why they stopped performing the procedures after 2014. Our ruling Richards said that "more than half the providers of safe and legal abortion have had to shut down." PolitiFact confirmed that since 2011, seven abortion providers have closed and an eighth stopped performing surgical abortions. That’s half of the previous 16 providers in the state -- not more than half. Also, four of the eight providers closed for reasons associated with provisions in HB 59, which Kasich signed. But that law hasn’t been directly tied to the other four abortion providers’ decisions to shut down. We rate Richards’ statement Half True.

pomt-02306	Says President Barack Obama's acceptance of an "Islamic order and gold medal" was "unconstitutional."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2014/apr/01/facebook-posts/meme-says-barack-obamas-acceptance-islamic-order-a/	In the run-up to President Barack Obama’s recent visit to Saudi Arabia, a reader sent us a Facebook meme that addressed a previous Obama visit to the kingdom. The meme features a pair of photographs of Obama, in what appears to be a Saudi palace, receiving an elaborate medal and necklace over his head. The text says, "Unconstitutional!!! Accepting an Islamic order and gold medal, 2/2011." The text of the meme goes on to quote the U.S. Constitution, Article I, Section 9: "No Title of Nobility shall be granted by the United States: And no Person holding any Office of Profit or Trust under them, shall, without the Consent of the Congress, accept of any present, Emolument, Office, or Title, of any kind whatever, from any King, Prince, or foreign State." We wondered whether Obama had received an honor from the Saudis, and if so, whether his acceptance of an "Islamic order and gold medal" was "unconstitutional." After a bit of digging, we discovered that the meme was referring to something that happened in June 2009 -- not February 2011, as the meme had said. It involved the awarding of the King Abdul Aziz Order of Merit, which is considered Saudi Arabia’s highest honor. It’s named for the first monarch of Saudi Arabia, also known as Ibn Saud. (The Saudi Embassy didn’t return an inquiry for this article.) We should also note here that, even though the meme has a distinct anti-Obama tone, President George W. Bush also received the same award in January 2008. After the award was placed around Bush's neck, the Associated Press reported, the president and King Abdullah "exchanged the region's traditional double kiss. ‘I am honored,’ Bush said." So, partisans beware: Whatever truth we find for Obama, the same will go for Bush. What does the Constitution say? A look at the Constitution confirms that the meme correctly relays the passage, known as the "emoluments clause." The framers included the clause because it signaled an end to hereditary leadership. Not only would the United States avoid granting titles of nobility itself, it would also prevent its leaders from accepting them from other countries. Under the emoluments clause, the president clearly qualifies as a "person holding any Office of Profit or Trust." And in this case he certainly received something "from any King, Prince, or foreign State." So the key question is this: Does the King Abdul Aziz Order of Merit qualify under one or more of the following categories. Is it a present? An emolument? An office? A title? We can quickly rule out "office." But the medallion is certainly a "present." Whether it’s an emolument (that is, a "gain from employment or position") or a title is a bit more up for grabs. Was it a "present"? Gifts -- tangible objects of more than trivial value -- are exchanged often in diplomacy, and there’s a well-established system for handling them. The portion of U.S. law known as 5 USC § 7342 ("Receipt and disposition of foreign gifts and decorations") sets out the conditions under which foreign gifts can be accepted. Essentially, a gift from a foreign country or foreign leader can be accepted on behalf of the United States, as long as it is handed over to an appropriate arm of the federal government, typically the General Services Administration or the National Archives. Often, these gifts find their way to presidential libraries, where the public can view them. The point is that they are property of the government, not the individual recipient. By passing this statute, Congress has essentially offered blanket consent for such acquisitions, without having to consider each one in a separate act. In the Jan. 18, 2011, edition of the Federal Register, the Obama administration officially disclosed the gift (a "large gold medallion with the Royal seal in a green leather display box" from "Abdullah bin Abd al-Aziz Al Saud, Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques, King of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia") and confirmed its disposition to the National Archives. So the medallion as a "present" appears to pose no constitutional problems. Was it an "emolument" or a "title"? The answer to this question is murkier. On the one hand, J. Peter Pham, director of the Atlantic Council’s Africa Center, said the King Abdul Aziz Order of Merit "is more than a mere medal. It confers an order, as indicated by its name, even if most people don’t take such things as seriously anymore." When King Saud created the order in the 1950s, Pham said, it was "modeled after the various orders of chivalry awarded by European royal houses," such as the United Kingdom’s Most Honorable Order of the Bath and Spain’s Order of Isabella the Catholic. Pham said these orders, both Saudi and European, "are differentiated from medals awarded for military service or civilian achievement. The latter are properly decorations, while the former confer membership, or honorary membership, in a class of individuals which, in former days, would have been referred to as having raised the recipient to the nobility if he or she did not already belong to it." In a 2009 Washington Post op-ed, Pham and Chapman University law professor Ronald Rotunda argued that "Washington, Madison and Hamilton would have clearly understood that the Abdul Aziz Order falls under the same ban they had in mind for any public officials coveting awards made under the honors system of the British monarchy." Other experts, however, say the King Abdul Aziz Order of Merit is more accurately considered an award for civilian achievement, not a grant of nobility. "All countries have decorations or honors they bestow on both their own citizens and foreigners, usually in recognition of some deed or act, or in the case of foreigners, simply an expression of gratitude for their contribution to the good relations between the two countries," said Edward W. Gnehm Jr., a professor at the Elliott School of International Affairs at George Washington University. "Many ambassadors receive similar medals or honors when they are leaving a post. They are certainly not a title, office or emolument." The ultimate argument against the order conferring a title stems from the specifics of how the Saudi royal family operates. "It is not a title of nobility, that is for sure," said F. Gregory Gause III, a Middle East specialist at the University of Vermont. "There is only one way into the ‘nobility’ in Saudi Arabia, and that is to be a member of the Al Saud family." The award, he said, is one "symbolizing achievement." Even Pham, who believes it’s fairer to say that acceptance into the order amounts to a title, agrees that the Facebook meme doesn’t describe the situation entirely accurately. Notably, he said, the meme is wrong to say that it’s an "Islamic order." "It is in fact open to non-Muslims, whereas the Saudi Collar of al-Badr is limited to Muslims," Pham said. Our ruling The meme says Obama's acceptance of an "Islamic order and gold medal" was "unconstitutional." Experts agree that Obama’s acceptance of the medallion and collar -- and their transferral to the National Archives -- is entirely constitutional, since the administration followed the longstanding rules on gifts set up by congressional statute. Experts are more divided, however, on whether acceptance of the medallion amounts to acceptance of a foreign title. Meanwhile, the meme errs in calling it an "Islamic order." On balance, we rate the claim Mostly False.	None	Facebook posts	None	None	None	2014-04-01T15:58:30	2014-03-27	['Islam', 'Barack_Obama']
pomt-04462	"We need a Senator who shows up to work. Sherrod Brown missed over 350 official votes."	mostly false	/ohio/statements/2012/oct/10/josh-mandel/josh-mandel-dings-sherrod-brown-missing-350-votes-/	For months, Democrats have accused Ohio Treasurer Josh Mandel of neglecting his official responsibilities because he failed to attend the first fourteen state Board of Deposit meetings that occurred during his term. Mandel denies that he ducked his duties and says his office sent a representative to each meeting. PolitiFact Ohio rated a claim about his missing work because he was traveling, raising campaign money as Half True. Now Mandel, the GOP candidate for U.S. Senate against Democratic incumbent Sherrod Brown, is airing a statewide television ad that says Brown is ignoring his official duties. The ad claims that Brown and other politicians in Washington "think they can live by a different set of rules," and dings Brown for missing more than 350 votes in Congress. "With 400,000 unemployed, we need a Senator who shows up to work," says the ad’s announcer, as the TV screen shows an empty chair. "Sherrod Brown missed over 350 official votes. When he finally showed up, voted to raise his own pay six times. Sherrod Brown, living by different rules than us." PolitiFact decided to look at the ad’s suggestion that Brown has not shown up for work and its claim that he missed over 350 official votes. A new release that announced the ad’s launch said Mandel’s campaign obtained its statistics from the GovTrack website. The news release also mentioned a fact missing from the ad that puts the missed votes in better perspective - they occurred over a period of more than 19 years, starting when Brown entered the U.S. House of Representatives in January 1993. A visit to the GovTrack website indicates there have been more than 10,000 recorded votes in that period. The largest number of Brown’s missed votes - 83 - occurred in 2000. He missed 13.7 percent of that year’s votes after suffering broken ribs and vertebrae in a car accident in Knox County. Brown spent more than a week in Mansfield MedCentral Hospital after the Jan. 30 crash, and missed occasional votes throughout the year because of follow-up medical treatments. For months after the crash, Brown wore an odd-looking plastic back brace around the U.S. Capitol. Then-President Clinton told Brown the brace made him resemble "a Roman soldier in a 1960s movie." Brown’s second highest year for missed votes was 2006, the year of his successful U.S. Senate race against incumbent GOP Sen. Mike DeWine. He missed 51 votes that year. Thirty-four of them were in its third quarter, the height of campaign season. Since he joined the U.S. Senate in 2007, GovTrack indicates that Brown has missed 21 out of 1779 votes - a 98.8 percent attendance record. This year, he hasn’t missed any votes. In 2011, he missed three. In 2010, he didn’t miss any. When asked why Mandel’s ad didn’t provide the context that Brown’s missed votes occurred over nearly two decades, Mandel spokesman Travis Considine said its claims are "factual," and observed that Brown’s missed vote rate was higher than the congressional median. The GovTrak website says the median rate of missed votes for all members of Congress is 2.5 percent, while Brown’s rate is 3 percent. "Why is it OK for Democrats to criticize Treasurer Mandel on meeting attendance but it’s not OK to question why Senator Brown missed more than 350 votes?" Considine asked in an email. "Are you employing a "different set of rules" for Brown and Mandel? " Brown’s campaign responded to the ad with a news release that claimed Mandel is "desperately trying to distract from his own appalling attendance record" by attacking Brown. It said Brown’s voting record would have been better if not for the car crash, and the fact that he had to care for his dying mother in 2009, a year when records show that Brown missed eight votes. There is an element of truth in Mandel’s claim: The ad correctly says that Brown has missed over 350 official votes. But it omits critical facts that would convey a different impression. It doesn’t mention those missed votes were spread over more than 19 years that includes Brown’s time in the U.S. House of Representatives and during that time more than 10,000 votes occurred. Brown’s voting attendance record throughout his congressional career - including time missed because of car crash injuries - is actually 96.5 percent. As a U.S. Senator, his attendance record is nearly 99 percent. Knowing those facts, and that Brown missed 351 out of 10,074 votes since January of 1993, would give a listener a different impression. On the Truth-O-Meter, the claim in the Mandel campaign ad rates Mostly False.	None	Josh Mandel	None	None	None	2012-10-10T06:00:00	2012-09-13	['None']
pomt-07361	"Prices are going up. Unemployment is continuing to go up."	half-true	/texas/statements/2011/may/06/ron-paul/us-rep-ron-paul-says-prices-are-increasing-and-une/	U.S. Rep. Ron Paul is courting the belly vote. During the first 2012 presidential debate in South Carolina on Thursday, the Texas Republican said the economy will cause President Barack Obama’s re-election efforts to suffer. "My theory is that people vote from their bellies because it’s whether they’re hungry or not or have jobs and need things, that’s why people vote," Paul said. "And we’re in big trouble. Prices are going up, unemployment is continuing to go up." We decided to check whether both prices and unemployment are rising. Let’s start with the former. Cheryl Abbot, an economist at the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, told us that prices are almost always going up because of inflation — the question is whether prices have been increasing at a faster rate as of late. And the answer is yes. According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics’ Consumer Price Index, year-over-year inflation rate has been accelerating since November 2010, when the rate was 1.1 percent. The bureau’s most recent data is from March, when the inflation rate was 2.7 percent. The price spike is "almost entirely due to gasoline prices," Abbot said. Take gasoline prices out of the picture, and the rate change is nominal, she said. What about unemployment? Flash back to January 2008, when the unemployment rate stood at a mere 5 percent. By October 2009, it was 10.1 percent. During most of 2010, unemployment hovered just below 10 percent, peaking in November at 9.8 percent. But since then, the rate has fallen every month, dropping to 8.8 percent in March. Until today, that is, when the the bureau reported that unemployment ticked up two-tenths of a point, to 9 percent, in April. That’s still high by historical standards, Abbot said, but she quibbles with Paul’s claim that unemployment "continues to go up." So do we. We have no qualms with Paul’s price claim, but unemployment has dropped steadily for four of the last five months. And the labor bureau didn’t report April’s uptick until after Paul made his debate talking point. We rate the statement Half True.	None	Ron Paul	None	None	None	2011-05-06T17:03:43	2011-05-05	['None']
pomt-05651	"This bill allows Virginia to join about 23 other states that have an ultrasound procedure" before an abortion.	mostly true	/virginia/statements/2012/mar/21/bob-mcdonnell/mcdonnell-says-23-states-have-ultrasound-requireme/	During a rapid-fire exchange on Meet the Press earlier this month, Gov. Bob McDonnell rejected host David Gregory’s contention that the legislation puts Virginia in a socially conservative corner. "This bill allows Virginia to join about 23 other states that have an ultrasound procedure," said McDonnell, a Republican. "It’s actually only about seven that have these kind of procedures," Gregory interrupted. "No, but there’s 23 that require a woman to have an opportunity to see an ultrasound," McDonnell replied. We wondered if the governor’s number is correct. Debate over Virginia’s law this winter became a national story when it became clear that the measure would require use of an invasive, transvaginal ultrasound -- even against a woman’s will. At McDonnell’s urging, the Republican-led General Assembly eventually passed a toned-down measure mandating that women, at least 24 hours before an abortion, undergo a common abdominal ultrasound in which an imaging wand is rubbed across the stomach. The patient must be offered an opportunity to view the image and hear the fetal heartbeat. Victims of rape and incest are exempt from the law if the molestation or assault was reported to legal authorities. Taylor Thornley, a spokeswoman for McDonnell, said the governor got his statistics about other states from separate studies by two groups that seldom agree: The Guttmacher Institute, a research and advocacy organization that supports women’s access to birth control and abortions; and the National Right to Life Committee, which opposes abortion. Neither group’s research includes Virginia’s law, which will become effective July 1. The National Right to Life Committee lists 23 states that have an "ultrasound option" and gives a brief description of each law. Guttmacher lists 21 states with ultrasound laws, including seven that mandate the test be performed before an abortion. Unlike the National Right to Life Committee, Guttmacher does not count North Carolina and Oklahoma, where the mandatory ultrasound laws have been stayed pending court challenges. Guttmacher shows the wide range of laws: Five states require that ultrasounds are offered to the woman by the provider: Indiana, Missouri, North Dakota, South Dakota and Utah. Nine states require that if an ultrasound is conducted to prepare for the abortion, the provider must offer to show the woman the image: Arkansas, Georgia, Idaho, Michigan, Nebraska, Ohio, South Carolina, Utah and West Virginia. Six states require an ultrasound for each abortion and the provider must offer to show the woman the image: Alabama, Arizona, Florida, Kansas, Louisiana and Mississippi. One state, Texas, requires an ultrasound for each abortion and that the provider display and describe the image. North Carolina and Oklahoma would fit into that final category if not for the court challenges. In the meantime, those states and Wisconsin require that women be given information on how to access ultrasounds. (Utah requires both that the woman be offered an ultrasound and that if the procedure is performed to prepare for the abortion, the woman is offered an opportunity to view the image.) So the state requirements range from giving women information on accessing ultrasounds to requiring abortion providers to give ultrasounds and display and describe the image. Elizabeth Nash, state issues manager at the institute, said once Virginia’s law goes into effect in July, it will be listed as requiring an ultrasound before an abortion and that the provider must offer to show the woman the image. Our ruling McDonnell, in a carefully worded statement, said the bill he recently signed "allows Virginia to join about 23 other states that have an ultrasound procedure" before allowing abortions. It is technically correct that 23 states have passed legislation that at least requires women be offered information on how to get ultrasounds before abortions. But the governor, in implying Virginia has adopted a mainstream law on ultrasounds, omitted a contradicting fact: Virginia will join only nine states that have passed mandatory ultrasound bills. And the enforcement of the laws in two of those states has been delayed by legal challenges. While McDonnell is accurate in saying 23 states have laws that deal with ultrasounds, his claim creates a misleading impression by not acknowledging only nine states require the procedure. We rate his claim Mostly True.	None	Bob McDonnell	None	None	None	2012-03-21T06:00:00	2012-03-11	['None']
pomt-11701	Says the Texas General Land Office led by George P. Bush has repaired just two homes since Hurricane Harvey.	mostly true	/texas/statements/2017/dec/21/jerry-patterson/charge-george-p-bush-led-agency-has-repaired-two-h/	Jerry Patterson says the fellow Republican who succeeded him as Texas land commissioner, George P. Bush, fixed very few homes in the months since Hurricane Harvey slapped ashore in August 2017. Patterson, otherwise confirming his 2018 candidacy for land commissioner, a post he previously held for 12 years, said in a recent interview that the Bush-led General Land Office hadn’t accomplished much in the way of hurricane relief. On Dec. 8, 2017, Patterson said to Austin American-Statesman commentator Ken Herman: "I mean, who the hell’s in charge here? And now we have tens of thousands of Texans who are essentially homeless and the land office has repaired two--two homes. And we’ve got folks waking up that have been sleeping in tents and they got snow this morning. People are still sleeping in tents." Patterson’s comment seemed potent given that the GLO announced in September 2017 it was teaming with the Federal Emergency Management Agency to hasten post-Harvey recovery in part by helping eligible survivors begin to patch up their homes--though full rebuilds weren’t in the mix. Bush said at the time: "With the magnitude of the damage from Hurricane Harvey, there is no doubt this will require a long recovery. This agreement marks the beginning of a new model for simplifying and expediting the transition out of sheltering to short-term and long-term housing recovery efforts." We focused this fact-check on Patterson’s insistence the GLO had only repaired two homes. Homeless--and tents? But Patterson’s other pokes also got our attention. How many Texans remain homeless due to the hurricane is hard to pin, we recently found. But a University of Texas expert, Gordon Wells, has estimated, based on flood insurance claims and satellite imagery, that at the least, more than 1 million Texas homes sustained flood damage though he told us that count could exceed 1.7 million. After Patterson spoke, we queried government officials about survivors in tents. By phone, the GLO’s Pete Phillips said some Aransas County residents, resistant to options such as out-of-town hotels, were residing in tents. Similarly, Bob Howard of FEMA’s Harvey response team responded by email: "Every effort is made to ensure survivors are aware of available local, state and federal resources. Thus far, all tent-dwellers found by the field team have indicated they prefer to remain in their current status or are not eligible for federal disaster assistance." Now let’s turn to Patterson’s focus on homes repaired with government help since Harvey and related rains flooded much of Southeast Texas. Patterson points to federal program We asked Patterson the basis of his numerical claim; he told us by phone that he was referring to two homes repaired as of early December 2017 through the federal Direct Assistance for Limited Home Repair (DALHR) program. Patterson, who said he’d drawn his tally of two from state-enlisted contractors and others he declined to identify, urged us to seek insight from elected leaders in counties hit by Harvey. We heard back from elected officials in two counties. Galveston County’s county judge, Mark Henry, said by phone that flooding due to Harvey had flooded 22,000 to 24,000 local homes with water an inch to eight feet deep. Henry, who volunteered that he’s a longtime friend to Patterson, said his office daily fields calls from residents awaiting help. Calling delayed repairs "frustrating," Henry said: "As far as the why" repairs have been delayed, Henry said, "I don’t know and I don’t care. I want it to get done." By email, a GLO spokeswoman, Brittany Eck, specified that as of mid-December 2017, the agency along with FEMA had housed 56 Galveston County "applicant households and 446 are in the process of receiving a direct housing solution." Also by phone, Loyd Neal, Nueces County’s judge, expressed chagrin that no agency advanced dollars enabling the Coastal Bend Council of Governments to hire individuals to consider applicants for short-term housing help. By email, Eck countered that the GLO had guaranteed up to $200,000 in reimbursed administrative costs to the regional councils asked to help administer post-Harvey housing assistance. Eck said that after the Coastal Bend council declined to participate, GLO employees were carrying out the program in that region. Neal told us that nearly four months since Harvey’s arrival, FEMA-funded housing including trailers or manufactured homes had yet to be brought into Port Aransas, the island tourist town where, Neal elaborated, more than two-thirds of local hurricane-damaged condominiums had yet to reopen. "It’s an absolute disgrace," Neal said, "that the state of Texas and the federal government and whoever else is in charge of this have not responded. It’s the greatest bureaucratic buck-passing I’ve ever seen." By email, Eck said that per FEMA in December 2017, 52 Nueces County households were in need of direct housing assistance. Correct count, but… We confirmed Patterson’s count of two homes whose DALHR repair projects had been completed with Eck and Phillips, a land office administrator. But those officials said Patterson’s claim gave short shrift to everything Harvey-related that Bush and the land office have undertaken and, Phillips said, to FEMA’s supervisory governing role. "He is oversimplifying what is going on," Phillips said, and "cherry-picking" given that the federal government supports housing options including thousands of hotel rooms, two types of home repair and possibly temporary apartments or trailers or manufactured homes. At the state level too, Phillips elaborated, "we’re always at the mercy of FEMA. They control the triage process" including, Eck said, confidential lists of homeowners for GLO to contact about their possibly seeking partial repairs backed by federal aid. Patterson, commenting on Phillips’ general assessment of his claim, said by email that "to be clear, I made a statement, and it turned out to be 100% factually accurate. None of the ‘context’ or ‘cherry-picking’ BS need apply." DALHR in Texas In November 2017, Bush announced the completion of the first DALHR home-repair project in Dickinson, in Galveston County. A GLO press release said the project included electrical and plumbing repairs, wall insulation, sheet rock, siding repair and replacing kitchen and bathroom sinks and a bathtub. That release said DALHR "provides permanent repairs for homeowners with moderate damages who lack available housing resources." But not everybody qualifies, the release made clear, in that beneficiaries must have sustained a FEMA-verified loss of $17,000 or more after 18 inches of interior flooding or more--though Phillips told us the GLO later encouraged FEMA to drop the 18-inch requirement, a change that qualified an additional 2,600 homes for consideration. According to the release, interested homeowners had to clear another half dozen hurdles such as a lack of other applicable insurance coverage and that eligible damages wouldn't exceed $60,000 or half the pre-hurricane taxable assessed value of the home. Then again, Eck told us by email, the latter limit was subsequently relaxed to allow awards to pay for up to half of a home’s replacement value. The November release also said that funded repairs under DALHR "are limited to real property components such as heating, plumbing, ventilation and air conditioning, walls, floors and ceilings," leaving our structural or engineering needs or any items covered by other aid. Varied aid offerings Let’s walk through some more of what the GLO and FEMA described as the programs they’re steering to Harvey survivors. Notably, Phillips said, and FEMA’s Howard confirmed, the teaming of the state agency with FEMA to coordinate short-term housing aid marked the first time a state agency had been given that front-line role. Eck said Gov. Greg Abbott "tapped the GLO to help FEMA implement these programs three weeks after the storm, in part due to the enormity of the affected area. In all cases, the applicant must be approved for eligibility by FEMA and, if interested, agree to the terms of FEMA’s regulations. The GLO is processing eligible applicants for short-term housing programs as FEMA is making their information available to the agency," Eck wrote. By email, Eck wrote that individuals displaced by the hurricane and its aftermath were offered federally funded hotel stays by FEMA while they looked for longer-term housing. "This program is currently housing 15,027 individuals in 1,334 hotels," Eck said. "None of the programs provided by FEMA are designed to be a permanent home replacement or complete repair program," Eck added. "The programs are designed to be short-term (up to 18 months) stopgap solutions while individuals work on long-term solutions." Starting Nov. 18, 2017, Eck wrote, the agency through early December 2017 had contacted 664 households judged by FEMA to be potentially qualified for the program. She said those contacts led to 290 expressions of interest and 182 DALHR home inspections--with 67 homes pre-qualified for repairs and 13 work orders issued for builders to start. "To date, two homes have had the work completed," Eck wrote. By email. FEMA’s Howard wrote: "We believe it is two projects at this point." Phillips said by phone that his DALHR goal was to complete more than 100 home projects by 2018; he said 36 builders were standing by ready to do the "re-work" on homes. Meantme, Phillips said, over 670 Texas families had received direct housing help by landing a trailer or manufactured home. At our request, FEMA’s Howard emailed us that agency’s daily Harvey fact sheet from the date that Patterson made his claim stating that 638 Texas families by then had been provided a trailer or manufactured home. As of mid-December, Howard told us by email, 8,057 Harvey survivors in the state still showed a need for a trailer or manufactured home and, he said, 2,600 of them remained under review for DAHLR aid. Otherwise, Phillips said, the GLO helped make available 40 apartment units in Wharton and also found 120 units of "corporate housing" to be made available in Conroe, in both cases under FEMA-backed programs. Howard said that generally by Dec. 14, 2017, 894,606 Texas residents had registered for Harvey-tired FEMA assistance of one kind or another. Another Patterson-cited program Patterson further told us the GLO had failed to help Texans benefit from another FEMA offering, the Partial Repair and Essential Power for Sheltering (PREPS) program, which provides up to $20,000 enabling homeowners to shelter in their homes thanks to limited repairs and the restoration of power. Eck said by email that PREPS aid was being offered by FEMA separately in that beneficiaries need a local government to provide a 10 percent match for an award to be made. By phone, meantime, Phillips said GLO officials had judged PREPS to be of limited value because families getting awards end up practically camping at home. The DALHR program, Phillips said, gets families "close to being whole." Our ruling Patterson said that since Hurricane Harvey, the agency helmed by Bush has done just two home repairs. Patterson’s figure, confirmed by GLO, was accurate. However, this claim leaves out ample significant information such as FEMA’s overriding control of the complicated DALHR program, which isn't open to every homeowner and only funds partial repairs. Notably too, additional homes were poised to qualify for or get repairs through DALHR at the time that Patterson spoke. We rate this statement Mostly True.

pomt-10139	"Oil companies ...currently have 68-million acres that they're not using."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/oct/07/barack-obama/unused-acres-arent-necessarily-being-ignored/	In the second presidential debate on Oct. 7, 2008, Sen. Barack Obama listed energy independence as one of the nation's biggest priorities, and touched briefly on the controversial issue of whether to open up new areas to offshore drilling. "I believe in the need for increased oil production," Obama said. "We're going to have to explore new ways to get more oil, and that includes offshore drilling. It includes telling the oil companies, that currently have 68-million acres that they're not using, that either you use them or you lose them." Obama has been a consistent opponent to opening new areas to offshore drilling. But in early August, Obama softened that position when he said he was open to supporting the New Energy Reform Act of 2008, a bipartisan compromise bill that includes alternative energy incentives that Obama wants — such as $84-billion over 10 years on research and development of better batteries, fuels and energy-saving technologies and tax incentives for people who buy hybrid and alternative-fuel cars — but also would allow drilling for oil and natural gas as close as 50 miles from Florida’s west coast. As he did in the debate, Obama has often bolstered his case against moving too fast on drilling with the argument that before opening up new areas to drilling, oil companies should be required to drill the acreage they already have. Obama is echoing a June report from the Democratic staff of the House Natural Resources Committee, which cited the fiscal 2007 statistics from the Interior Department's Minerals Revenue Management that classified 67,055,715 acres of oil and gas leases as "non-producing." The line sounds good as a Democratic rebuttal to Republican demands that Democrats move to allow drilling in Alaska's protected Arctic National Wildlife Refuge and offshore areas that also are currently off limits to the oil and gas companies. A Democratic House bill would bar new oil and gas leases to leaseholders who have not met benchmarks to "ensure" oil and gas production within five years on the leases they already hold. But Obama's statement is misleading, inasmuch as it suggests that oil and gas companies have access to 68-million acres of oil and gas fields that they deliberately are not drilling. What Obama did not take into account is the long, complex process that companies must work through, both in federal red tape and in geologic exploration, before leased property becomes a producing oil or gas field. The government classifies that acreage as "non-producing" simply because the companies aren't taking oil and natural gas out of it now. David Curtiss, director of the American Association of Petroleum Geologists' Geoscience and Energy Office in Washington, D.C., says it's wrong to assume that "the only lease that is being actively worked is one that has a drill rig on it." The Interior Department issues leases for onshore territory for 10-year initial terms. The department issues offshore leases for five-, eight- or 10-year initial terms, depending on the depth of the water. Dave Smith, a spokesman for the department's Minerals Management Service, which handles offshore leases, says those initial terms are calculated according to how long the government thinks it will take oil and gas companies to find and start producing oil or gas. For both onshore and offshore leases, the companies have to comply with government permitting requirements as they undertake a lengthy scientific exploration process that culminates in test drilling to determine whether there is enough oil or natural gas in a particular spot to warrant full-scale drilling. All the while, the companies are paying rent to the federal government for acreage that is classified as "non-producing." It can take more than 10 years for a company to start producing oil or natural gas from a leased parcel, but as long as the company can demonstrate that it is making serious efforts to find some, the leases are extended. If the company cannot show that it's actively working the parcel, the lease is not renewed. Sometimes companies don't renew leases if their early work leads them to believe adequate reserves of oil or gas don't exist. Obama's statement suggests that "non-producing" acreage where drilling is permitted is land that oil companies are ignoring. That is simply not true. Years of exploration and federal permitting must be completed before leased land yields oil or gas. As a result, we find Obama's claim to be False.

pomt-04197	"The city of Atlanta has one of the highest lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender populations per capita, ranking third among major American cities."	half-true	/georgia/statements/2012/dec/07/alex-wan/claim-about-size-atlantas-gay-population-has-some-/	The ongoing national debate about same-sex marriage recently reached the court of opinion inside Atlanta City Hall. Alex Wan, an openly gay Atlanta city councilman serving his first term, introduced legislation during the City Council’s last meeting of 2012 declaring support for marriage equality. Wan’s nonbinding resolution contained several pieces of information to back up his argument. We thought one statement in particular would be interesting to fact-check. "The city of Atlanta has one of the highest lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender populations per capita, ranking third among major American cities," it read. Atlanta has long been perceived to have one of the largest LGBT populations in the South, if not the nation. An annual LGBT pride festival draws an estimated 200,000 people. Several intown neighborhoods have businesses that market heavily to the LGBT community. Mayoral candidates actively courted LGBT voters during the 2009 campaign. Wan’s resolution passed by an 11-2 vote. Wan’s resolution may have little sway across the street from City Hall among lawmakers who work in the state Capitol. In 2004, 76 percent of Georgia voters backed a constitutional amendment banning same-sex marriage. The councilman recognized that obstacle, but believes the tide is shifting nationally on the issue and wanted Atlanta to be on the forefront. Wan said he’s unaware of any other Georgia cities that have passed a similar resolution. "We should be one of the first voices to that dialogue because of the sheer number (of LGBT residents in the city)," Wan said in a telephone interview. Wan added that he has been with his partner for more than seven years and said it "seemed inconsistent to me" that they’ve made such a commitment but can’t have it legally recognized by the state. The issue is somewhat thorny inside City Hall. Atlanta Mayor Kasim Reed has been criticized by some LGBT activists for not fully supporting same-sex marriage. Reed, who as a state lawmaker successfully passed a hate crimes bill to protect gays and other groups, has said he respects the council’s vote on the resolution. Wan said he didn’t intend to pressure Reed by introducing the resolution and hopes the mayor will soon "reach the same conclusion" on same-sex marriage. Wan said he based the claim about Atlanta off information from the online library Wikipedia. The Wikipedia link used a chart that was published in 2006 in The Seattle Times. The chart read Atlanta ranked third, with 12.8 percent of its population as LGBT. The sources for the chart were the U.S. Census Bureau and the Williams Institute, which conducts research on sexual orientation, gender identity law and public policy. The U.S. Census Bureau tracked the number of same-sex couples (it does not attempt to determine sexual orientation) by county in 2010. Among counties with 50 or more same-sex couples, DeKalb County was first in Georgia and 10th nationwide with about 15 same-sex couples per 1,000. Fulton County was second in Georgia and ranked 21st in the U.S. with nearly 12 same-sex couples per 1,000. According to another website, City-Data, Atlanta ranked 32nd in the percentage of same-sex unmarried households. If you narrow it down to cities with overall populations greater than 100,000, Atlanta ranked sixth in the percentage of same-sex unmarried households. The list does not indicate when it was compiled, but the numbers were pretty similar to the most recent U.S. census data. PolitiFact Georgia reviewed 2011 U.S. census data, and it showed the percentage of same-sex unmarried households in Atlanta was 1.6 percent. Atlanta’s percentage was lower than San Francisco, Fort Lauderdale, Fla., Oakland, Calif., Seattle and Santa Fe, N.M. Of those cities, Seattle is the only one in a state that recognizes same-sex marriages, and their law was passed last month. To sum up, Councilman Wan said Atlanta has one of the highest lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender populations per capita and ranks third nationally. From what we can determine from U.S. census and other data, it’s valid to state Atlanta has one of the highest LGBT populations in the country. It’s less clear that Atlanta ranks third nationally because there’s not much current data detailing the percentage of all LGBT residents by city. Atlanta ranks below more than at least five cities when it comes to same-sex, unmarried households. The first part of Wan’s claim appears accurate. But even these numbers are open to interpretation. It appears Atlanta is a little lower than third in the other part of the claim. Overall, Wan’s statement is probably accurate, but it needs a lot of context. We rate it: Half True.

pomt-10168	Under Obama's tax plan, "95 percent of you will get a tax cut."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/sep/27/barack-obama/many-will-get-tax-cuts-but-not-that-many/	At the presidential debate in Oxford, Miss., Barack Obama described his tax plan and said, "Here's what I can tell the American people: 95 percent of you will get a tax cut." We checked a similar claim of Obama's recently, that 95 percent of working families would get lower taxes under Obama's plan, and found it to be True . But Obama stretched things when he said that 95 percent of "you" — everyone — would receive a tax cut. The part of Obama's tax plan that results in widespread tax cuts is a tax credit for workers, intended to offset payroll taxes. Single workers would get $500, and working couples would get $1,000. But not all taxpayers get paychecks from an employer, and those who don't would not get the credit. Additionally, Obama intends to raise taxes on higher brackets ($200,000 for singles and $250,000 for couples) which would offset any tax cuts for those incomes. A detailed analysis by the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center found that if you look at all tax filers, 81 percent of tax filers would see reduced taxes under the Obama plan. So Obama's statement at the debate glosses over a few important details about who would get tax cuts under his plan. If you're talking about everyone, it's 81 percent. If you're talking about working families, it's 95 percent. The difference between 81 percent and 95 percent is not insignificant. We rule his debate statement Half True.

pomt-13493	Says Donald Trump supports "an agenda out there" to privatize the Veterans Affairs health care system.	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/sep/07/hillary-clinton/hillary-clinton-says-donald-trump-supports-privati/	Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton pledged to do "whatever is required to move the VA into the 21st century" during NBC’s Commander-In-Chief Forum, while adding that her opponent’s plan would be much worse for veterans. "I will not let the VA be privatized," Clinton said Sept. 7, 2016, during the forum at the Intrepid Sea, Air & Space Museum in New York. "I do think there is an agenda out there, supported by my opponent, to do just that. I think that would be very disastrous for our military veterans." We wondered if Republican nominee Donald Trump has proposed or supports privatization of the health care system for U.S. veterans. Trump, for the record, addressed the question head on when it was his turn to answer questions. "I never said take the VA -- take the Veterans administration -- private." "I wouldn’t do that," Trump added. "I do believe, when you're waiting in line six, seven days, you should never be in a position like that. You go out, you see the (private) doctor, you get yourself taken care of." Trump's comments are consistent with what he's said before, and Clinton's concerns about privatization are a misleading Democratic talking point. In July, Democratic vice presidential nominee Tim Kaine said that "Donald Trump is a guy who has called for privatization" of the VA. What we found then, and what holds now, is that Trump wants to give veterans access to private providers when they face delays at the VA. That's not the same as privatization. When we contacted Clinton's campaign about her statement, spokesman Josh Schwerin sent us several references where Trump's plan has been characterized as some degree of privatization and Trump’s explicit promise to give veterans the chance to go elsewhere for care. "Every veteran will get timely access to top quality medical care. Every veteran," Trump pledged in a July 11, 2016, speech in Virginia Beach, Va. "Veterans should be guaranteed the right to choose their doctor and clinics, whether at a VA facility or at a private medical center. We must extend this right to all veterans, not just those who can’t get an appointment in 30 days or who live more than 40 miles from a VA hospital, which is, unfortunately, the current and wrong policy." The logistics of how that would work, of course, are another matter. Trump has spoken of letting VA patients go to any doctor or health care facility that accepts Medicare and getting treatment there immediately. The VA would pay for the bill. Experts we spoke with raised several issues with Trump’s plan and also debated whether Trump's plan should be considered a type of partial privatization. One concern is that non-VA providers don’t have the same level of experience that the VA has with treating veteran's health issues — including combat injuries, combat-related illnesses and mental health issues such as post-traumatic stress disorder. There's also concern that letting veterans go anywhere for their care would result in fragmented, uncoordinated, and lower-quality care. Our ruling Clinton said Donald Trump supports privatizing the Veterans Affairs health care system. Trump does support allowing more privatized care in cases where treatment at the VA is delayed or inadequate. In some cases he's talked about giving veterans a choice that would include doctors and hospitals outside the system. But that's not the same as privatizing the system, which would get the get the government out of the treatment business. Trump has never proposed that. Because Clinton's statement contains some element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression, we rate it Mostly False. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/9e782bf2-269d-45f2-9c69-c527093c99f2	None	Hillary Clinton	None	None	None	2016-09-07T22:32:00	2016-09-07	['None']
pomt-03446	Says the Obama administration plans to reduce the number of beds devoted to holding individuals violating immigration laws and to "release hundreds of dangerous criminals into our communities."	mostly false	/texas/statements/2013/jun/21/michael-mccaul/mccaul-said-obama-administration-plans-reduce-dete/	U.S. Rep. Michael McCaul of Texas warned of bad guys on the horizon while summarizing proposed appropriations for the Department of Homeland Security. In his June 5, 2013, floor remarks, the Austin Republican and chairman of the House Homeland Security Committee said the outlined spending would cover additional Border Patrol officers and continued operation of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, which enforces laws governing border control, customs, trade and immigration. Plus, McCaul said, the legislation had "funding for ICE’s 34,000 detention beds despite the administration’s plans to reduce the number and release hundreds of dangerous criminals into our communities." A flood of dangerous criminals? In this context, "beds" refers to ICE regularly placing non-U.S. citizens "who are apprehended and determined to need custodial supervision" in more than 250 facilities around the country, Congress has lately required the government to maintain at least 34,000 beds to house such apprehended individuals, though not all the beds are always filled. Administration urged reduction in detention beds McCaul spokesman Mike Rosen told us by email that Congress mandated 33,400 detention beds from 2009 through 2011 before raising the threshold to 34,000 starting in 2012. In contrast, Rosen said that President Barack Obama had proposed to fund 31,800 beds in fiscal 2014, which begins Oct. 1, 2013. Homeland Security’s 2014 budget request says the cut would save $114 million, adding: "This level of beds allows ICE to ensure the most cost-effective use of federal dollars, focusing the more-costly detention capabilities on priority and mandatory detainees, while placing low-risk, non-mandatory detainees in lower cost alternatives to detention programs." An April 12, 2013, Washington Times news article put the budget request this way: "The president said he wants to reduce the number of illegal immigrants ICE keeps in detention from 34,000 to 31,800." The story also said, "Congress fought hard during the past decade to boost the number of detentions, arguing that those who were allowed back into the general population rarely returned to be deported." The story quoted Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano as saying the department believes it can keep all high-priority individuals detained with the lower number of beds, while making use of alternatives to track the other people in deportation proceedings, the story said. So, the administration sought to fund fewer detention beds. Detainees have included few violent criminals And was the result going to be hundreds of dangerous criminals let loose? ICE officials did not respond to our inquiry about the percentage of violent criminals in detention nor did we come up with other current-day breakdowns. But according to a Feb. 11, 2010, outside analysis, when the number of detainees surged more than 60 percent to 385,524 from fiscal 2005 through fiscal 2009, few of them had criminal convictions. The study by the Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse at Syracuse University found that detainees "without any criminal conviction doubled between fiscal 2005 and (fiscal) 2009," the study said, when they accounted for 73 percent of detainees. However, the share of detainees with criminal convictions reached 43 percent in the first three months of fiscal 2010, the study said, as increases in overall detainees leveled out. Government released 2,200 detainees By email, Rosen said McCaul’s reference to dangerous criminals reflected on "detainee releases for budgetary reasons," including felons, in 2013 that McCaul tabulated based on information he obtained from ICE’s director, John Morton. During February 2013, the agency indeed released individuals who had past criminal convictions, according to news accounts and testimony, though few had felony convictions and most remained subject to immigration proceedings. Public knowledge of the releases appears to have been spurred by a news story. On March 1, 2013, the Associated Press reported that Homeland Security had recently released more than 2,000 illegal immigrants from its jails--in states including Arizona, California, Georgia and Texas--due to looming budget cuts. According to the report, the released individuals--granted supervised release under conditions that can include mandatory check-ins, home visits and GPS devices--would still be required to appear for immigration hearings. The story, citing ICE budget documents, said the agency had temporarily shuttered plans to release 3,000 additional detainees in reaction to intense criticism. The internal budget documents "show the Obama administration had intended to reduce" the average daily population of detainees from about 31,000 to 25,748 by the end of March 2013, the story said. Also, Rosen pointed us to an ICE document with those figures. About two weeks after the news story appeared, ICE’s Morton testified to the Homeland Security Subcommittee of the House Appropriations Committee that he had 2,228 detainees released over several weeks from Feb. 9 to March 1, 2013 "to other forms of supervision," according to a transcript. He said he acted for immediate budgetary reasons plus concern about the federal sequester that was set to trigger automatic cuts starting in March. Also in February 2013, Obama warned that if the sequester hit, "federal prosecutors will have to close cases and let criminals go." PolitiFact in Washington rated that claim Mostly False, concluding that while U.S. Attorney offices would face cuts under the sequester, officials would have discretion in prioritizing cases notably involving, by and large, individuals yet to be tried. Official: Dangerous criminals not among released Morton told the subcommittee that ICE’s releases did not include dangerous criminals. He said officials let out individuals "who were not subject to mandatory detention and they did not pose a significant threat to public safety" and, he said, each individual remained subject to deportation. Seventy percent "of those individuals released had no criminal record," Morton said. "The remaining 30 percent were either misdemeanants or other criminals whose prior conviction was not a serious violent crime." He closed his prepared statement by saying "there are no mass releases of dangerous criminals under way or any plan for the future, just efforts to live within our budget." Questioned by U.S. Rep. John Carter, R-Round Rock, the subcommittee chairman, Morton said the released individuals included 10 "Level 1" offenders, in this case meaning crimes like aggravated financial felonies, Morton said, and four of the 10 were subsequently returned to custody. The six not returned to custody were not violent criminals, he said. Morton said one "Level 1" offense occurred in 1979 and another involved the single father of a 5-month-old child. He said that in each of these releases, field officers made the decision "and I'm confident that if I were to share these offenses with you, you would be better reassured that we are not out willy-nilly releasing serious Level 1 offenders." Morton said the released individuals included 159 "Level 2" offenders, including "a fair number" of people whose "most serious offense will have been for a theft offense, for example petty larceny or shoplifting, traffic offenses. The largest category will be for" drunk driving, Morton said, including some multiple convictions. He said 460 "Level 3" offenders, convicted of misdemeanors, were released, saying their crimes would have ranged from a single traffic offense, a single drunk driving conviction or shoplifting. In May 2013, Nelson Peacock, an assistant secretary of homeland security, said 622 of the released detainees had some type of criminal conviction. In his May 6, 2013, letter to Sens. Carl Levin and John McCain, which McCain posted online, Peacock specified that there were 32 Level 1 and 80 Level 2 detainees released. He wrote, too, that 58 released detainees were re-detained. At the March subcommittee hearing, Carter noted that the agency’s "priorities for detention include illegal aliens who have not been convicted of crimes but otherwise pose a threat to national security or public safety." Morton replied that no such detainees were released. He also said he did not know how many of the released individuals had pending criminal charges. Carter: "How many were violent criminals?" Morton: "I am not aware of any violent criminals..." Also at the meeting, Rep. Henry Cuellar, D-Laredo, said that under federal law, the agency has had the authority to release detainees since at least 1952. Morton agreed, saying detentions are the exception to normal practices. "We have limited resources," Morton said. "Congress has directed a level of mandatory detention that focuses around mainly violent offenders and certain aliens; the vast majority of the people in the system Congress provides for consideration for release." Morton earlier said: "Just to give you some perspective of it, there are 350,000 people in immigration proceedings at any given time, only about 34,000 of whom -- actually, in Alaska, some of the Border Patrol cases aren't even in formal proceedings -- are in detention. The vast majority of people are not detained by design. Congress has provided for their release on bond or a supervision. Immigration judges make those calls." Next, we circled back to McCaul’s office per Morton's testimony. By email, Rosen said the "drastic reductions" in detention beds in Obama’s budget request "would inherently result in the release of dangerous criminals." Outside takes We also ran the congressman’s claim past David Burnham, co-director of the records clearinghouse, who said any reference to dangerous criminals being let go exaggerates the administration’s intent. "There’s some rhetoric here," Burnham said. Donald Kerwin, who directs the New York-based Center for Migration Studies, which describes itself as devoted to the study of migration, to the promotion of understanding between immigrants and receiving communities and to public policies that safeguard the dignity and rights of migrants and newcomers, pointed out by telephone that the administration has long said its focus is on deporting criminal immigrants and recent arrivals, which is what ICE says on an agency web page including a graph indicating that in the fiscal year through September 2012, 55 percent of immigrants removed from the country were convicted criminals. An Obama adviser, Cecilia Muñoz, touted the approach in a White House blog entry Aug. 18, 2011. Kerwin speculated that the only way the administration would release a seriously violent criminal from detention is "mistakenly." Our ruling McCaul said the Obama administration, seeking to reduce the number of detention beds, plans to "release hundreds of dangerous criminals into our communities." The administration has sought to shrink the number of beds devoted to holding individuals in detention, saying that would save money. If approved, this could lead to more individuals who face immigration proceedings not living behind bars. It also looks to us like the government is keeping its options open on releasing more immigration detainees if money runs tight. However, we did not confirm any related expected release of hundreds, or even a few, dangerous criminals. The February 2013 release of 2,200-plus individuals didn't include violent criminals, a top administrator testified. McCaul’s statement has an element of truth; the administration's budget request. But there doesn't appear to be any plan to release dangerous criminals. We rate the claim as Mostly False.	None	Michael McCaul	None	None	None	2013-06-21T10:31:04	2013-06-05	['Barack_Obama']
pomt-14974	"I did not play any role in bringing the company to RI as did others in government. I was tasked with handling the legislation affecting the company by my superiors."	false	/rhode-island/statements/2015/oct/18/steven-costantino/despite-his-protests-afar-costantino-played-key-ro/	Steven M. Costantino, a former House Finance Committee chairman, was more than a hundred miles away, working in Vermont’s state government, when newly disclosed public records and emails fueled a wave of recent headlines on the $75 million 38 Studios boondoggle. From the other side of the Green Mountains, he could feel the spotlight. The state’s financing of the upstart video-game company, to the tune of $75 million in loan guarantees, lured 38 Studios from Massachusetts to Providence in 2010, but left Rhode Island taxpayers vulnerable in the company’s 2012 bankruptcy. Amid the torrent of new headlines about 38 Studios, Costantino, who is now commissioner of the Department of Vermont Health Access, issued the following statement on Sept. 27: "My only involvement in the matter in RI was because of my former position in the RI legislature. I did not play any role in bringing the company to RI as did others in government. I was tasked with handling the legislation affecting the company by my superiors." Costantino acknowledges he was involved with the legislation, but denies "any role," compared with what "others in government" did, to "bring" Curt Schilling’s 38 Studios to Rhode Island. How can he have been both involved and not involved? Unfortunately, the former lawmaker did not respond to our request for an interview, leaving us to sort out this contradiction on our own. The freshly released emails and deposition transcripts hark back to early 2010 when Rhode Island’s courtship of 38 Studios began to get serious. The documents give the public a window into which state officials were driving the 38 Studios deal. Costantino comes across as a behind-the-scenes facilitator, helping to lay the groundwork for the public financing. The comments recorded in the depositions and other records show that Costantino: Developed the idea for guaranteeing 38 Studios’ loans. He was the first to advocate for 38 Studios’ receipt of a $75-million state guaranteed loan, according to Keith Stokes, chairman of the R.I Economic Development Corporation at the time. And J. Michael Saul, then the EDC’s finance director, recalls that Costantino proposed the expansion of an existing loan guarantee program during a visit to 38 Studios’ headquarters in Maynard, Mass. "And at the conclusion of the meeting," Saul testified, "he turned to me and asked me the question: If we were to increase the $50-million (loan program) to $125 million would this -- I’m paraphrasing here -- would this be helpful to get this done?" In another email, an EDC lawyer, Robert I. Stolzman advised Carcieri’s chief of staff Andrew Hodgkin that he had sent him several documents including a draft "authorizing the RIEDC to guarantee 38 Studios’ debt (at the suggestion of House Finance Chairman Costantino, the … draft reflects a larger authorization for this as a Jobs Creation Guaranty Program)." Costantino, in his deposition in 2014, did not to dispute anything in the Stolzman note. Was among just a few lawmakers in the loop. Only House Speaker Gordon Fox, Senate President M. Teresa Paiva-Weed, Sen. Daniel DaPonte, and Costantino knew about the 38 Studios transaction when the General Assembly approved the bill for the guarantees in 2010, according Marcel A. Valois, the EDC’s former director. Another email from Stolzman, the EDC’s lawyer, suggests that Sharon Reynolds, the House fiscal adviser, and Costantino were privy to certain background and "summary information" on the "38 Studios transaction" before Governor Carcieri. Shielded the 38 Studios transaction from public scrutiny. During a videotaped discussion of the bill on the House floor on April 13, one lawmaker asked about the origins of the loan guarantee legislation and who was behind it. "There's always conversations with lobbyists and small businesses," Costantino said. He didn’t name 38 Studios. Later on in June of 2010, Costantino told Stolzman he hadn’t told a Providence Journal reporter about his visit to 38 Studios. And Costantino said he wanted to know what EDC staffers were saying about the deal. Steered the legislation for 38 Studios’ guaranteed loan. In two separate April 2 emails with the numerals "38" noted in the subject line, Stokes mentions Costantino’s role in scheduling the legislation, advising others that "Steven Costantino wants to move on it next week" and that Costantino has advised him that House Speaker Fox wants to post the item for hearing. Our ruling In his defense, Costantino issued a statement in which he said: "I did not play any role in bringing the company to RI as did others in government. I was tasked with handling the legislation affecting the company by my superiors." In other words: Don’t blame me, I was just doing my job. But the records and comments of people involved illustrate that Costantino played a key part in Rhode Island's courtship of 38 Studios. The legislation he helped pass, offering valuable loan guarantees, was his idea, according to one former EDC official. During the process, Costantino shielded his idea from the type of full political scrutiny that might have killed it. He did this by not naming 38 Studios on the House floor when he was asked who was pushing for the loan-guarantee program. When the deal was done, the CEO of Schilling's company thanked all members of the General Assembly and singled out five elected officials by name, including the former House Finance Committee chairman. Costantino played a pivotal role in creating the 38 Studios mess. In some ways, the record shows he bears as much responsibility as the other elected government officials who "tasked" him. We rate his statement False. (If you have a claim you’d like PolitiFact Rhode Island to check, email us at politifact@providencejournal.com. And follow us on Twitter: @politifactri.)

pomt-09459	"President Obama's bill won't bring down the costs (of health care) for average Americans -- or really for very few Americans, if any."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/mar/04/michele-bachmann/bachmann-says-democratic-health-care-bill-wont-low/	Rep. Michele Bachmann, R-Minn., has a reputation for using political rhetoric that pushes the envelope. On March 3, 2010, she appeared on CNN's Larry King Live along with Democratic Rep. Alan Grayson, a Floridian who's also known for his outspokenness from the opposite ideological perspective. We thought we'd look into one of the comments she made about the issue of the day: the Democratic health care reform plan. "Unfortunately," she said, "President Obama's bill won't bring down the costs for average Americans -- or really for very few Americans, if any." To test this claim, we turned first to the nonpartisan referee for such questions -- the Congressional Budget Office. We looked at a CBO analysis of the Senate Democratic health care bill released Nov. 30, 2009. This bill -- which was passed by the Senate in December 2009 -- forms the basis for President Barack Obama's own proposal. (The CBO has not directly analyzed Obama's proposal, but most health policy analysts do not expect the numbers to change dramatically from what the CBO analyzed in November.) Before we dig into the CBO study, we should outline the three types of private coverage and how they differ. Individual policies are obtained directly by individuals or families, without an employer serving as an intermediary. "Small-group" plans are provided through small employers. And "large-group" policies are plans obtained through larger employers. The CBO looked at the effect of the health care bill on premiums for each category. One other thing to know: The bill provides subsidies for people in the individual and small-group markets whose income is below certain thresholds. The CBO looked at how the bill would change premiums both before subsidies were factored in and after. So here's what the CBO expects for 2016, the year its analysts chose as the benchmark. For individual plans -- before subsidies are taken into account -- the bill would make policies 10 percent to 13 percent more expensive. But a big reason for this increase is that the bill would set higher minimum standards for coverage. So, before subsidies are factored in, people and families buying individual policies would have to pay more, but they would also be getting more generous coverage. However, it's worth noting that many people on the individual market would qualify for subsidies. In fact, the CBO estimates that 57 percent of individual-market purchasers would. And once these subsidies are factored in, buyers on the individual market would see their premiums drop quite a bit -- between 56 percent and 59 percent, according to the CBO. (The question of whether to count or not to count subsidies when analyzing the bill became a major bone of contention during the Feb. 25, 2010, presidential health care summit; you can read a previous PolitiFact item for a more detailed explanation of this question, http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/feb/25/barack-obama/obama-says-under-democratic-health-plan-family-ins/) For the second category -- the small-group market -- the CBO estimates that unsubsidized premiums would land somewhere on the continuum between rising by 1 percent and falling by 2 percent. For the 12 percent of small-group beneficiaries who are expected to qualify for subsidies, premiums would fall by 8 to 11 percent. Finally, in the third category -- the large-group market -- the change in premiums would range from no change to a 3 percent decline. (Large-group beneficiaries are not eligible for subsidies under the bill.) To fuly analyze Bachmann's claim, we need to add in one additional factor: the number of Americans who will buy insurance in each of these three markets. The CBO estimates that 134 million people will be covered by large-group plans, 25 million will be covered by small-group plans and 32 million will be covered by individual market plans. The total of these three categories is 191 million people. (Remember that many Americans are covered by Medicare, Medicaid or other government plans, and these are not included in the CBO's analysis, or in ours.) Let's first analyze these numbers using the strictest definition -- unsubsidized premiums. And because the CBO is using a range of likely outcomes, we'll do our best to quantify how many people will actually see their premiums fall. We'll do this by assuming that, say, for a range of 10 percent to 13 percent, one quarter will see a change of 10 percent, one quarter will see a change of 11 percent, one quarter will see a change of 12 percent, and one quarter will see a change of 13 percent. The real numbers will not fit so neatly into that kind of breakdown, but health economists tell us it's a serviceable guide. By our reckoning, then, three quarters of the 134 million people in large-group plans -- 101 million -- will see their premiums fall slightly. Next, in the small group market, let's assume that half the beneficiaries will see a decline in premiums (those who see their premiums fall by 1 percent or 2 percent.) That translates to about 13 million people. So, right off the bat -- without factoring in subsidies -- the CBO expects 114 million people to see their premiums go down at least a little bit. That's about 60 percent of beneficiaries. Once subsidies are accounted for, the percentages rise. In the small-group market, 12 percent of beneficiaries would qualify for subsidies, the CBO projects. Proportionally, these subsidies would reduce premiums for an additional 1.5 million people. In the individual market, 57 percent would qualify for subsidies, according to CBO. That's about 18 million people who'd see their premiums drop. So, adding it up, nearly 134 million people should see their premiums go down when subsidies are factored in. That's about 70 percent of all privately insured Americans. What about the rest? By our calculations, about 45 million people would see their premiums stay the same. Adding them to the 134 million Americans who saw their premiums drop, you get 179 million people, or almost 94 percent of those on private insurance. That leaves about 14 million Americans who would see their premiums go up, according to the CBO's model. (The numbers don't add up to 191 million due to rounding.) These unlucky beneficiaries -- mostly people with individual insurance who earn too much to receive subsidies -- account for 7 percent of those with private insurance in 2016. Of course, the CBO's projections are only that -- projections. In addition, basic mathematics suggests that some number of Americans will see their premiums rise or fall by greater amounts than the CBO estimates. So our exercise should be taken with due caution. But the CBO is the generally accepted arbiter of these questions and the overall trend seems solid despite the caveats. However, looked at another way, Bachmann would have had a stronger point if she had said the bill's benefits are limited. Only about 21 million people -- those who receive subsidies -- will see their premiums drop by more than a few percentage points. That's about 11 percent of the people with private insurance in 2016 -- within shouting distance of the "very few Americans" she referenced in her quote. Measured in raw dollars, a decrease of 1 to 3 percent won't put a whole lot of additional money in the pockets of the other nine-tenths of the private market. By the CBO's estimate, the difference could be on the order of $100 or $200 on a several-thousand-dollar policy. But we're rating Bachmann's claim that "President Obama's bill won't bring down the costs (of health care) for average Americans -- or really for very few Americans, if any." And on that, our interpretation of the CBO numbers indicates she's wrong. Using the strict, unsubsidized figures, 60 percent of Americans in the private insurance market should see their premiums fall. And taking into account the subsidies, a full 70 percent would see their premiums fall. And almost 94 percent would see their premiums either fall or stay the same. No matter how you slice it, the overwhelming majority are likely to see a decline. So we find her claim False.

pomt-06417	"The largest category of people coming into the technical schools in Wisconsin are people with four-year degrees."	false	/wisconsin/statements/2011/oct/26/scott-walker/gop-gov-scott-walker-says-largest-category-technic/	We’ve heard the lousy job market has led many people to go back to school. But huge numbers of people with four-year degrees going to technical college? Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker spoke about technical colleges when he was asked about unemployment during a TV interview that was broadcast Oct. 16, 2011. He told CW14 in Green Bay he had repeatedly heard employers say "we have jobs, particularly good-paying manufacturing jobs, we just don’t have enough skilled workers, we don’t have enough people interested in those jobs." The Republican governor went on to say: "In fact, the largest category of people coming into the technical schools in Wisconsin are people with four-year degrees because the jobs that they’re looking for with their degrees aren’t there, and so instead they’re going back to school to get more technical training." Technical colleges have long been the next step for many students who have just finished high school and for experienced workers looking to upgrade their skills. So we wondered if those groups are now being outnumbered in Wisconsin’s technical schools by people with bachelor’s degrees. That’s what Walker said -- but it apparently isn’t what he meant. Walker spokesman Cullen Werwie told us in an email: "My understanding is that this quote was based on a conversation he had with tech college officials where they made a point to highlight the fact that one of the fastest growing enrollment demographics was individuals who have attended four-year colleges." That’s a far cry from Walker stated in the interview. He labeled college graduates the largest group entering technical schools. So, let’s dig into the numbers. Technical colleges are a key part of the discussion of how to attack unemployment in Wisconsin, where the jobless rate was 7.8 percent in September 2011, and at the national level. A few days after an October 2011 survey revealed that U.S. manufacturers lack qualified applicants for 600,000 skilled positions, the Wisconsin AFL-CIO cited the shortage and called on Walker to restore a 30 percent funding cut he made to technical colleges in the 2011-2013 state budget. The number of college graduates, meanwhile, who applied to U.S. graduate schools rose 8.4 percent in 2010, according to a September 2011 report from the Council of Graduate Schools. So, are an increasing number of four-year graduates heading to technical college, too? As of 2009, the number of four-year degree holders transferring into one of Wisconsin’s 16 technical colleges"had grown 30 percent in the last decade," according to a publication from the Wisconsin Technical College System. But that statistic is a bit dated and it deals with whether that group is increasing. A small set of individuals can still show a large percentage increase. Moreover, Walker referred to four-year grads in relation to other groups. So, we sought more information from Morna Foy, executive assistant and vice president of policy and government relations for the technical college system. Foy said she believed Walker was trying to repeat a statement that she and other technical college system officials had made -- that a growing percentage of transfer students into the technical colleges are students who already have four-year degrees. We asked her for a breakdown of transfer students who entered technical college in 2009, 2010 and 2011, to see if there were any trends. Foy emphasized that the 2011 figures were just being finalized, so Walker would not have been aware of them when he made his statement. The figures show that students with four-year degrees -- more specifically, those who had completed 16 or more years of schooling -- made up 15 percent of the nearly 10,000 technical college transfer students in 2009. The rate increased to 16 percent in 2010. So, based on figures that had been publicized when Walker did the TV interview, there was a 1-percentage-point increase between 2009 and 2010 in the number of people entering technical college who had four-year degrees. (The rate remained at 16 percent for 2011.) But in each of the three years, the largest category of students transferring into the technical colleges each year remained those who had completed 12 years of schooling -- in other words, high school graduates. High school graduates made up more than one-third of the transfer students each year, more than twice the level of four-year grads. Our conclusion Walker said "the largest category of people coming into the technical schools in Wisconsin are people with four-year degrees." Walker’s spokesman said the governor actually meant to claim that an increasing number of people with four-year degrees are going to technical college. Between 2009 and 2010, the percentage of college graduates entering technical college rose a bit. But high school graduates make up the largest category of transfer students in technical schools, far outnumbering those with college degrees. We rate Walker’s statement False.

pomt-02970	"No one beta-tested" healthcare.gov.	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2013/oct/22/sam-stein/huffington-posts-sam-stein-says-no-one-beta-tested/	The rollout of the Obama administration’s health insurance marketplaces website has been so roiled with problems -- from a pricing glitch, to flawed data, to widespread log-in fails -- that even journalists from left-leaning media are calling for top officials to be hauled before Congress. But while appearing on MSNBC’s Morning Joe, Huffington Post political editor Sam Stein went a bit too far in criticizing the agency’s prep work before the Oct. 1 launch of healthcare.gov. Or at least that's what he told us when we asked him. "It seems from all of the reporting, and from what I can gather, that up until very recently they (the Obama administration) didn’t realize how bad this was going to go out," Stein said on MSNBC. "And no one beta-tested the site, which is almost criminal when you think about it." The beta-testing line got picked up by conservative outlets such as the National Review and the Blaze, and we wanted to check it out. Stein directed us to a Washington Examiner report with a headline that somewhat contradicted his statement, which he acknowledged: "Troubled Obamacare website wasn’t tested until a week before launch." "Unfortunately, in the rush of cable news, I didn't add the clause ‘until a week before launch,’ " Stein told us. "I should have done that and apologize." That’s true. But Stein is more right than even he thinks, in part because he inadvertently used the word "beta" to describe the specific website testing. In the IT world, there are many kinds of tests under many kinds of names. Put another way, Stein goofed -- but by goofing, he got closer to the truth. Here’s what you need to know. The Examiner story, quoting someone speaking anonymously, said officials did not allow testing on the website until just days before it went live Oct. 1. The biggest problem, according to this report and others, was that leaders of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services decided to act as the central coordinator for the project (CMS would not tell the Examiner if the agency holds that role). The next day, the Washington Post described how government officials and contractors proceeded with the rollout despite a botched crucial test days earlier. They ran a simulation, unsuccessfully, in which a few hundred people tried to log onto the website at the same time. The failure proved an early warning of the bumpy road to come. Officials went forward with the launch, and the website "locked up" almost immediately when 2,000 users tried step one, the Post reported. Unnamed sources told the Post that an end-to-end trial run of the process did not happen by as late as Sept. 26, the week before the launch. (Here at PolitiFact we don't rely on unnamed sources, but the reports from the Examiner and the Post appear credible.) "Beta testing" is a very specific term in the tech world that most professional software goes through before launching. It comes after a product is in an "alpha" phase, or the earliest version of software that is subject to some tests to find any big issues. When a product reaches beta, it is tested by a larger group of people not connected to its development in an effort to gather feedback and make more fixes before a large-scale launch. Big tech companies like Google sometimes launch products in beta mode, but enterprise and government software vendors don’t usually do it that way, said Alexander Howard, former Washington correspondent for tech-centric O’Reilly Media and a fellow at the Tow Center for Digital Journalism at Columbia University. They stop adding features in the months preceding a launch to "start testing the heck out of it," Howard said. The development of healthcare.gov has been an entirely different story, he said, with no use of those terms. "The only thing we have is reporting that says the first testing occurred the last week before it went live, and then it went live," Howard said. "There was testing, but it’s not clear that it was in a beta version." According to published reports, healthcare.gov got additional features quite close to the launch, with no evidence of a consumer-centric test that went outside of the government. So Stein might have inartfully used the word beta-testing, but he might also have a point. "Even if those tests nominally did occur, they were as good as nonexistent based on the complexity of the project," said Patrick Ruffini, a Republican digital strategist. Testing of any kind was difficult because the specifications for the website were evolving the month before the website went up, said Gail Wilensky, senior fellow at Project Hope and former Medicare director under former President George H. W. Bush. The Post story, by the way, said a test group of 10 insurers that had access to the site advised the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services that the site was not ready to launch nationwide. Insurers have been in "regular communication" with government officials and contractors to test the back end of the site dealing with enrollment, Robert Zirkelbach, spokesman for the industry group America's Health Insurance Plans, told us. But most people are getting hung up on the earliest steps of setting up an account and verifying who they are. We reached out to CMS and CGI Federal, one of the main contractors for the website, but did not hear back. (We suspect they’re busy.) Our ruling Here’s what Stein said: "No one beta-tested" healthcare.gov. Stein, in fact, meant to say something else, he told us. But at PolitiFact we check the statements as they are made. In this case, Stein is closer to the truth than maybe even he thought. Stein specifically referred to beta testing on MSNBC, which is a phrase that traditionally means certain members of the public were allowed to access the website well before it opened. There's no evidence to suggest that happened, and the federal government isn't talking. Ultimately, this is a glitch of a statement talking about the glitches of a website. But it rates Mostly True.

pomt-08247	Portland Community College serves more students than all of the state’s universities combined.	false	/oregon/statements/2010/nov/13/portland-community-college/portland-community-college-tries-put-enrollment-nu/	It’s that time of the year again, when universities and colleges start to release their fall headcount numbers. Normally PolitiFact Oregon would leave this stuff to the education reporters -- except that one figure in the article Portland Community College wrote about its enrollment caught us by surprise. After noting the total student headcount for this fall -- 41,409 -- PCC went on to say that annually, it serves "more than 93,800 students ... (more than all of the state’s universities combined)." It was that last note that gave us pause. Could one community college really be serving more people than the entire state university system? We decided to find out. First, we went back to Portland Community College and asked for more specific numbers. Laura Massey, the college’s director of institutional analysis, said that for the 2009-2010 academic year, Portland Community College served roughly 93,799 students. So the news release had that number right. Next we went to the Oregon University System to check out their numbers. Bob Kieran, the assistant vice chancellor of institutional research and planning, told us that, for the same time period, the state-run universities served 122,883 students. It’s clear that, with these numbers, the statement in the PCC release doesn’t hold up. Before we issued a verdict, though, we decided to look at the numbers one other way. Overall student headcount can be a little misleading in that it counts every student, no matter the amount of time they actually spend on campus. Say you decide to take a single photography course for leisure, well, you’re counted the same as a student going to school full time in pursuit of a degree. Luckily, Oregon community colleges and universities are also required to report "full-time equivalent" numbers. That means they combine part-time students and count them as one full-time student. One full-time equivalent is equal to a student being fully enrolled for the fall, winter and spring terms of a given year. According to Massey, for the 2009-2010 school year, Portland Community College counted 31,395 full-time equivalents. Kieran says the entire Oregon University System counted 80,944. Again, the numbers don’t support the PCC claim. (That, of course, doesn’t diminish the fact that Portland Community College serves an awful lot of students each year.) James Hill, the man who wrote the enrollment numbers article, said that "it’s always been that case" that PCC served more students annually. He said he would review his numbers and thanked us for pointing out the discrepancy. Seeing as how neither the total headcount or full time equivalent figures back PCC up, we find this claim False.

pomt-08443	"If you want to see the jobs that I've saved and created in this storm he helped create, go anywhere in Ohio."	mostly true	/ohio/statements/2010/oct/16/lee-fisher/fisher-touts-job-development-success-stories-acros/	If Ohio voters take away one line from this years election, it will be that the state has lost 400,000 jobs. It's a number more ubiquitous than your ZIP code and the first talking point of GOP statewide candidates, from treasurer to governor. And its the mantra of Republican U.S. Senate candidate Rob Portman, a former congressman and top adviser to President George W. Bush. Portman uses the figure to put his Democratic opponent, Lt. Gov. Lee Fisher, on the defensive. That's because Fisher, who took office in January 2007, also served as the state's development director. That's the position responsible for creating jobs, and Fisher held the title until he announced his U.S. Senate bid in February 2009. PolitiFact Ohio has found the figure is accurate, ebbing and flowing from month-to-month, but that it leaves out a lot of context. Namely, the national recession influenced the states job losses more than any single politician, and the states been losing jobs under both Democrats and Republicans for more than a decade. Fisher blames the state's job losses entirely on the recession created by Bush's job and trade policies, which were influenced by Portman's two years in the White House. While Fisher offered the same defense again in the most recent debates, he also highlighted his argument that as lieutenant governor and development director, he was busy negotiating deals to save and create other jobs across the state. He drew loud applause from his hometown crowd at the Oct. 8 debate at the City Club of Cleveland when he walked off the stage with this line: "If you want to see the jobs that I've saved and created in this storm he helped create, go anywhere in Ohio. If you want to see the jobs he helped to create, go to Beijing, Shanghi, or Hong Kong." PolitiFact Ohio already has examined the second part of this statement. We thought now we'd examine the first part, that Fisher created or retained jobs around the state. Fisher is referring to a number of Ohio companies, some well known, such as Akron's Goodyear Tire & Rubber, and some much less familiar, such as Toledo's Xunslight Corp. So let's look at some of the deals he has mentioned by name in the debates and on the campaign trail: Goodyear: Fisher and his colleagues in the development department worked closely with Goodyear officials for months to put together a lucrative aid package that helped persuade the tire maker to build a new headquarters in Akron. Goodyear received a $20 million low-interest loan and $30 million in tax credits from Ohio. These were tied to keeping 2,900 workers for 15 years and its headquarters in Akron for 30 years. Of course, many others, notably Akron Mayor Don Plusquellic and developer Stuart Lichter, also played key roles. First Solar: The company started here using technology developed at the University of Toledo, but now is based in Arizona. It still has a production plant in Perrysburg. The company received a $225,000 grant in 2009 to expand that facility while Fisher headed the Ohio Department of Development. Amylin Pharmaceuticals: The San Diego-based company made a decision to open a facility near Cincinnati and later expand its operations before Fisher was in office. But in 2007, Gov. Ted Strickland's administration cut a deal to give the company a 10-year, 75 percent tax credit to encourage it to invest $400 million in an expansion project. At the time, the Cincinnati Enquirer quoted West Chester Township Trustee President George Lang, a Republican, crediting Fisher with helping get the deal done. Xunlight: The flexible solar panel maker received a $7 million loan from the state in 2008 through a couple of sources. The company has complimented the Strickland administrations focus on renewable energy. General Motors: On the verge of collapse just a couple of years ago, the company received support from both Bush and President Barack Obama. Fisher and other Democrats supported the federal governments decision to loan the company $50 billion. And Fisher and Strickland help secure a nearly $82 million state tax package for the company to help expand in 2008. While Fisher cant claim credit for being singularly responsible for landing any of these deals, he played a role as development director and lieutenant governor. And the state has helped far more companies than noted above. So, can you find Fisher handiwork in the four corners of the state, as he suggests? While he's adding a bit of rhetorical flair when he says, look anywhere in the state, he is conveying an accurate picture of his and the development department's work. So we rate his statement Mostly True.	None	Lee Fisher	None	None	None	2010-10-16T13:30:01	2010-10-08	['Ohio']
pomt-11943	"Loopholes in current law prevent ‘Unaccompanied Alien Children’ (UACs) that arrive in the country illegally from being removed."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2017/oct/11/donald-trump/donald-trump-omits-facts-claim-loopholes-minors-un/	President Donald Trump recently sent Congress a list of his immigration priorities as legislators consider a plan to allow Dreamers to stay in the United States. Dreamers are young people who grew up in the United States after being brought here illegally as children or infants. Trump has said he was willing to negotiate with Democrats in order to allow them to stay. In exchange, Trump is seeking changes to immigration law that would affect other minors who come to the United States illegally. "Loopholes in current law prevent ‘Unaccompanied Alien Children’ (UACs) that arrive in the country illegally from being removed," said Trump’s outline. "Rather than being deported, they are instead sheltered by the Department of Health and Human Services at taxpayer expense, and subsequently released to the custody of a parent or family member -- who often lack lawful status in the United States themselves." The children Trump is talking about tend to be from Central America, as opposed to Mexico. Waves of unaccompanied minors from Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador came to the United States in recent years fleeing gang violence and poverty. Trump wants to make it harder for these children to claim asylum (a type of relief sought by unaccompanied minors) and to be able to remove them all expeditiously. Typically, a loophole refers to an unintended consequence, ambiguity or omission from a law that allows something to be evaded. The Trump administration, however, deems the procedures laid out in law for treating unaccompanied minors as "loopholes" that need to be changed. But the law explicitly requires that a federal agency place children from non-border countries "in the least restrictive setting" (in many cases with family members) and to help them access legal counsel for their removal proceedings. Even with these procedures, however, thousands of children are still ordered removed. Trump’s claim gives a misleading impression. How the laws for unaccompanied minors work An Unaccompanied Alien Child is the legal term for a child who does not have a lawful immigration status in the United States; is under 18 years old; and has no parent or legal guardian in the United States, or for whom no parent or legal guardian in the United States is available to provide care and physical custody, according to U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services. The number of apprehensions of unaccompanied minors peaked in 2014 at 68,541, up from 38,759 in fiscal year 2013. Their apprehensions have fluctuated since 2014. Border Patrol agents tallied about 38,500 apprehensions of unaccompanied minors from October 2016 to August 2017. There have been concerns for years that unaccompanied minors were not being adequately screened to determine if they should be sent back to their countries. So Congress passed the William Wilberforce Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act of 2008, formalizing how they should be treated, and President George W. Bush signed it into law. "Special rules" in the law allow unaccompanied minors from contiguous countries (Mexico and Canada) to be quickly returned to their countries. But unaccompanied minors from other countries are not immediately sent back by immigration officers; they are placed in formal removal proceedings. The law requires that they be transferred within 72 hours to HHS, which places them "in the least restrictive setting that is in the best interest of the child." In many cases, children await their immigration court hearing while living with family members in the United States, including relatives who are in the country illegally. The law directs HHS to ensure "to the greatest extent practicable" that unaccompanied minors have access to legal counsel, including pro-bono services. The procedures for unaccompanied children cases are not loopholes, but rather basic requirements of the law, said Mark Greenberg, a senior fellow at the nonpartisan Migration Policy Institute and a former acting assistant secretary for the Administration for Children and Families within HHS during the Obama administration. Legal representation a factor in case outcome The most common immigration relief granted to unaccompanied minors includes asylum, special immigrant juvenile status, and "T nonimmigrant status" for victims of trafficking, said a January 2017 Congressional Research Service report. Data shows that children with an attorney are more likely to be allowed to stay in the country than children who lack representation. The Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse (TRAC) at Syracuse University examined outcomes for unaccompanied minors cases filed and decided from fiscal years 2012 to 2014. Outcomes for unaccompanied minors with an attorney (8,761 cases): In 73 percent of cases an immigration court allowed the child to stay in the United States, in 12 percent of cases a child was ordered removed, in 15 percent of cases a judge entered a "voluntary departure" order (child still has to leave the country, but the voluntary departure carries less severe consequences than a removal order). Outcomes for unaccompanied minors without an attorney (12,817 cases): In 15 percent of cases the child was allowed to stay in the country, in 80 percent of cases a child was given a removal order, and in 5 percent of cases, a voluntary departure order. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com Our ruling Trump said, "Loopholes in current law prevent ‘Unaccompanied Alien Children’ (UACs) that arrive in the country illegally from being removed." The Trump administration argues there is a loophole for unaccompanied minors primarily from Central America. They are referred to HHS and in many cases placed with family members while they await their immigration court hearing. The law directs HHS to try to connect unaccompanied minors with legal counsel, and having an attorney can help them win their case and allow them to stay in the United States. But this process is not a loophole; it’s outlined in the law. The law also does not prevent their deportation: at least 2,707 unaccompanied minors were removed in fiscal year 2017. The statement has an element of truth but leaves out critical context that would give a different impression. We rate it Mostly False.

pomt-01536	"New Hampshire has lost more jobs to China than any other state."	half-true	/new-hampshire/statements/2014/sep/16/senate-majority-pac/ad-targeting-scott-brown-says-new-hampshire-has-lo/	As Election Day draws nearer, the New Hampshire Senate race has grown in prominence nationally. With polls showing the contest between Democratic incumbent Jeanne Shaheen and Republican challenger Scott Brown closer than ever, both candidates -- and their independent allies -- are airing hard-hitting attack ads, hoping a victory might sway control of the U.S. Senate. One ad released on Sept. 15, 2014, by the Senate Majority PAC, a Democratic-aligned independent group, takes aim at Brown for his alleged support for outsourcing jobs. Part of the ad piqued our interest: "New Hampshire has lost more jobs to China than any other state," the narrator says. Accompanying the narration was a visual that said, "NH has lost more jobs to China than any other state." Given that New Hampshire ranks as only the 42nd biggest state in population, that claim sounded odd. So we decided to take a look. Senate Majority PAC did not respond to an inquiry, but we found the Union Leader article cited in the ad. It covered the publication of a study in 2012 by the Economic Policy Institute, a liberal group based in Washington. It’s worth noting that the report’s authors cautioned that "it is not a statistical survey of actual jobs gained or lost in individual companies, or the opening or closing of particular production facilities." Rather, the group fed federal trade and employment data into a mathematical model to estimate how many jobs were displaced by trade with China between 2001 and 2011. So what did the study find? It found that New Hampshire ranked first among the 50 states in the estimated number jobs lost to China -- as a percentage of the state workforce. That’s similar to, but not the same as, the ad’s language. The ad talked about the number of jobs, not jobs as a percentage of the workforce. If you measure estimated job losses by the raw number instead of the percentage of the workforce, then New Hampshire, a relatively small state, falls far down the list. New Hampshire is tied for the 29th out of the 50 states on the list of estimated job losses. And on the list of congressional districts in the report, neither of New Hampshire’s two districts rank among the top 20 nationally for estimated job losses to China. We’ll close by noting that the Union Leader’s headline got it right, but the ad’s version of that headline dropped four key words at the end. The article said, "NH has lost more jobs to China than any other state, 2.94% of total workforce." Our ruling The Senate Majority PAC ad said that "New Hampshire has lost more jobs to China than any other state." First, the ad did not note that this was an estimate, rather than a hard number of actual jobs lost to China. Second, the estimate was that New Hampshire lost the biggest percentage of its workforce -- not most jobs -- to China. We have no quarrel with the use of workforce percentages as the yardstick for this comparison, since doing so makes it possible to fairly compare 50 states that have widely disparate numbers of residents. But the distinction between jobs and percentage of the workforce should have been reflected in the ad. Otherwise, it makes the ad’s claim seem more powerful than it is. The claim is partially accurate but leaves out important details, so we rate it Half True.	None	Senate Majority PAC	None	None	None	2014-09-16T16:46:42	2014-09-15	['China']
pomt-06199	I differed with my party on business legislation, on consumer protection, and on free trade agreements.	false	/oregon/statements/2011/dec/10/suzanne-bonamici/suzanne-bonamici-says-shes-different-other-democra/	The two major party candidates vying for a congressional seat in January’s 1st District special election both claim to be independent and bipartisan. At a recent debate co-hosted by the Independent Party of Oregon, former Democratic state Sen. Suzanne Bonamici and Republican businessman Rob Cornilles were asked to provide hard evidence. John Schrag of The Forest Grove News-Times asked: "...Can you provide three specific examples of where you differ from your party on matters of policy that are either now before Congress or we can expect to come before Congress in the next couple of years?" We will consider Bonamici’s three examples, on business, consumer protection and free trade, with this question in mind: Did she, in fact, differ with her party on matters of policy? Overall, Bonamici said she looks at policy on its merits, regardless of the forces behind it. "And that happened in the last session, when my party Democratic chair didn’t want to hear a bill that I thought was good for Oregon business. I convinced that chair to hear the bill, it passed and it’s helping an Oregon business right now," she said. House Bill 2095, now law, allows Oregon to join a multi-state compact that makes it easier for insurers to offer new products. It passed out of the Oregon House on a 48-10 vote and landed in the consumer protection committee of Sen. Chip Shields, D-Portland. He was afraid the compact would erode local oversight. Bonamici favored the bill and convinced him to allow a vote in committee. "She bucked a Democratic chairman; no one would have had an opportunity (to vote) had she not taken on her Democratic chairman," said Carol Butler, Bonamici’s campaign manager. Still, the proposal cleared the Senate 28-2. While the no votes came from Democrats, most in her party supported the bill. We give her credit for changing Shields’ mind, but we rule this portion False. Bonamici: "Another place where I’ve differed -- in fact I’ve become a leader in my party -- and that’s on consumer protection issues: cracking down on mortgage fraud, making sure that people who are facing foreclosure have all the opportunities that they can to prevent losing their home, protecting seniors and middle class families from scams. I’ve been a leader and strengthened my party in that way." That’s a sweet talking point. But consumer protection is an issue on which Democrats have long prided themselves. Oregon Senate Democrats highlighted the issue as an agenda item for the 2011 Legislature -- and proudly claimed success after the session. Still, the director of Economic Fairness Oregon insists that many Democrats would have been happy approving watered-down legislation if not for Bonamici’s advocacy. "The best example," said Angela Martin, "is in her advocacy of consumer protection with teeth." So let’s accept that Bonamici goaded skittish Democrats into supporting more consumer friendly legislation. That still doesn’t make up for the fact that siding with consumers is supposed to be a key part of the Democratic Party platform. To suggest otherwise is silly. We could rate this a Pants on Fire. Bonamici: "And finally, during this campaign I could have taken the easy way in a primary campaign and said I wouldn’t support the free trade agreements that were pending before Congress. I took my time and did research and came to a reasoned conclusion about those, rather than just take a party line approach on those." Congress approved agreements with South Korea, Colombia, and Panama, earlier this year. Generally, businesses like trade agreements as a way to get goods into other countries. Labor groups argue they will lose jobs. In the special primary election, Bonamici’s main rivals came out against the trade agreements. Bonamici refused to take a position then, saying that she would need specifics in order to vote. Job creation in the district would be her main criterion. But is being opposed to free trade the party-line approach? Oregon’s Democratic delegation split on the proposals. Sen. Ron Wyden and Reps. Earl Blumenauer and Kurt Schrader came down on the free-trade side (although Blumenauer and Schrader did vote against the pact with Colombia, where there are particular concerns over the killing of unionists). Sen. Jeff Merkley and Rep. Peter DeFazio voted against all three. Bonamici now says she would vote for the South Korean agreement, but against the other two. We don’t see how her position differs with those in her party. Democrats in Congress split. But we’ll give her a Mostly False, because she was under pressure from her primary opponents. We get what Bonamici is trying to say. In the first case, she differed with Shields, a Democrat, who controlled the committee, but not from the rest of her caucus. In the second case, she differed with some Democrats who, according to one lobbyist, had to be coaxed into tougher legislation. In the third case, she differed with her primary opponents. But that doesn’t mean she’s differed with Democrats on matters of policy. We combine the three mini-rulings to come up with a False.

pomt-14008	The presence of gorillas calls into question the concept of evolution.	false	/punditfact/statements/2016/jun/03/rush-limbaugh/rush-limbaugh-asks-why-cincinnati-zoo-gorilla-hadn/	A question for the ages: Why is a gorilla a gorilla, and not a human? Conservative radio host Rush Limbaugh wondered aloud about primate evolution while discussing the case of a boy who fell into a gorilla enclosure at a Cincinnati zoo. Limbaugh said the zoo keepers did the right thing when they made the difficult but necessary choice to shoot and kill Harambe, a 400-pound male gorilla, to protect the toddler in the May 28 incident. But some animal activists are outraged at the death of a critically endangered animal. One dimension of this outrage, Limbaugh said, is people think they’re related to gorillas. "A lot of people think that all of us used to be gorillas, and they're looking for the missing link out there," Limbaugh said. "The evolution crowd. They think we were originally apes. I've always had a question: If we were the original apes, then how come Harambe is still an ape, and how come he didn't become one of us?" Limbaugh has delivered mixed messages on his belief in evolution in the past. In 2004, he asked why chimpanzees and baboons "got stuck being idiot gorillas" instead of becoming humans. Then in 2010, he said, "clearly things evolve," while still expressing skepticism about the progression of human and primate evolution. We thought we’d take the opportunity to answer Limbaugh’s question and explain why the presence of gorillas doesn’t negate the concept of evolution. Humans are apes, as members of the taxonomic family hominidae, which also includes the great apes — orangutans, chimpanzees and gorillas. Humans, the great apes, monkeys and more are all primates. However, humans didn’t evolve from gorillas or other apes, as Limbaugh suggests. Rather humans, gorillas and all other apes evolved from a common ape-like ancestor (now extinct) around 5 million to 8 million years ago. See the primate family tree to the left. Scientists know this from studying the comparative anatomy and DNA for humans and other creatures, said Blythe Williams, a professor of evolutionary anthropology at Duke University. "Each species has changed over time," Williams said. "For reasons that are not clear, our own species has changed in some very dramatic ways, such as becoming bipedal and getting really big brained." Some experts believe this common ancestor was chimp-like, while others think it might have been different from anything currently living, said David Pilbeam, professor of human evolution at Harvard University. Williams said the question Limbaugh poses — why gorillas and humans coexist despite evolution — is akin to asking why Rush Limbaugh hasn’t evolved into his cousin, Stephen, or vice-versa. The two share a common ancestor, but they’re not the same person. "They are different people, with some shared DNA," Williams said. "But because of the introduction of other genes into their gene pool, via parents, they are not exactly the same as one another or their shared grandparent." So it’s not that there was a linear progression from gorillas to humans, and some gorillas just didn’t evolve. It’s that over some 6 million years, descendants of a single, common species became gorillas, and others became humans. "Evolution, including human evolution, doesn't have a goal beyond survival and reproduction," Pilbeam said, making the argument that becoming human isn’t the end-all-be-all in evolution. Homo sapiens are the only remaining human species, having emerged about 200,000 years ago, though there used to be numerous human species, including our closest extinct relative, the neanderthal. Certain genes differ just 1.8 percent between humans and gorillas. The difference in those genes is about 1.2 percent between humans and our closest animal relative, the chimpanzee. Our ruling Limbaugh said the presence of gorillas calls into question the concept of evolution. Limbaugh hit on a common misconception that humans evolved from modern-day apes. In reality, modern-day humans and modern-day gorillas are cousins, having both evolved from a common, but now extinct, ancestor. We rate Limbaugh’s statement False. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/b42f712a-3014-4819-ac8e-9e84151e6146	None	Rush Limbaugh	None	None	None	2016-06-03T14:21:19	2016-05-31	['None']

"As secretary of state, she worked hard to get strong sanctions against Iran's nuclear program," Clinton said on the second night of the 2016 Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia. "And in what the Wall Street Journal no less called a half-court shot at the buzzer, she got Russia and China to support them." This sounded like a fact-check we’ve done before. On the campaign trail, Hillary Clinton has said she put together the sanctions that helped usher Iran to the negotiating table, ultimately resulting in the landmark nuclear deal.

Throughout her first 18 months as secretary of state — from January 2009 to June 2010 — U.S. and global sanctions on Iran increased, and it’s fair to say that Clinton and the State Department played a major role in this development. The invitation Upping sanctions on Iran was a clear priority for Clinton’s State Department. She talked at length about the importance of pressuring Iran to discontinue nuclear activity, including through sanctions, at her nomination hearing in January 2009. She and other members of the Obama administration spoke publicly about the topic regularly. The State Department, including top aides and Clinton herself, led the diplomatic effort to get other countries to join the U.S. plan to pressure Iran, overcoming large hurdles such as getting Russia and China on board. In her memoir Hard Choices, Clinton recalls hashing out final details of a plan over drinks with a Chinese official. The New York Times reported that she personally talked with Russian foreign minister Sergey Lavrov. As Bill Clinton said in his speech, a Wall Street Journal editorial did call this feat "a half-court shot at the buzzer." In June 2010, the United Nations Security Council approved tough new sanctions on Iran, including expanding an arms embargo and restricting certain financial and shipping enterprises. At the time, Obama called them "the toughest sanctions ever faced by the Iranian government." Those sanctions enabled even tougher measures from the United States and the European Union, which were passed immediately. Congress passed several more bills containing additional sanctions on Iran during the rest of Clinton’s tenure, which ended in early 2013. While the Treasury Department is the primary agency responsible for enforcing sanctions, Clinton appointed a special adviser in 2010 to oversee U.S. efforts "to ensure full and effective implementation of all U.N. Security Council resolutions related to Iran, including most recently UNSCR 1929." Experts told us that Clinton is correct to take some of the credit for the rapid increase in international sanctions on Iran, and these sanctions were a big part of the reason why Iran rejoined multilateral talks about its nuclear program. The RSVP The State Department was key to getting other countries to go along with and add to U.S. efforts to pressure Iran, said Patrick Clawson, senior fellow and research director at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy. The international sanction ramp-up "shocked Iran's leaders," Clawson said. "Besides the pain the sanctions inflicted, they raised the possibility more — worse — was coming. That was a key factor pushing Iran to resume more serious talks." There is room for subjective interpretation on who deserves the credit for effective sanctions because many corners of the U.S. government are involved in the Iran effort, said Suzanne Maloney, deputy director of the foreign policy program at the Brookings Institution. But the State Department had its hands in every aspect of new sanction-making and implementation. And in the absence of the United Nations resolution, which was Clinton’s lobbying success, it would have been challenging to get a global coalition to significantly ramp up the sanctions, she said. But whether sanctions were a big factor in bringing Iran to the negotiating table is not crystal clear, Maloney said. Iranian officials have historically denied the significance of sanctions, but Ayatollah Ali Khamenei has said recently that Iran negotiated the deal specifically to have sanctions lifted. Beyond the multilateral effort, Clinton’s team also played a role in the sanctions that Congress passed, said Richard Nephew, an expert on sanctions with the Center on Global Energy Policy at Columbia University. Lawmakers would not have written that legislation without consulting the State Department and the administration (as evidenced in this 2010 New York Times article). Nephew noted, though, that Congress did pass some sanctions that went further than the administration’s wishes. "Without Secretary Clinton's good diplomacy— and the message that she radiated down the system to make this a priority and so forth — you can argue that the reductions would not have been as steep or as lasting," Nephew said. Congress’ sanctions that affect Iran’s oil exports resulted in a 50 percent reduction in oil exports and were instrumental in getting Iran to the negotiating table, said Nephew, who worked at the State Department under Clinton. Our ruling Bill Clinton said, "As secretary of state, (Hillary Clinton) worked hard to get strong sanctions against Iran's nuclear program" and "got Russia and China to support them." During Hillary Clinton’s first 18 months as secretary, the State Department led the global effort to increase sanctions on Iran — notably getting Russia and China on board — culminating in an important U.N. resolution. Clinton was personally involved in these diplomatic efforts and pushed them publicly. Experts said these sanctions, on top of other sanctions passed before and after, were crucial to getting Iran to the negotiating table. However, Clinton wasn’t singularly responsible for the sanctions or getting China and Russia to support them, just as the sanctions passed under her watch likely weren’t singularly responsible for opening up Iran to talks.

pomt-08553	"An organized crime syndicate was extorting money from his (Tom Ganley’s) business, threatening his family, but he fought back and won the FBI's highest civilian award"	true	/ohio/statements/2010/sep/30/tom-ganley/tom-ganley-touts-role-fbi-investigation/	Tom Ganley is the largest automobile dealer in Ohio, and the owner of other businesses including insurance, real estate, aviation, and finance companies. But it is a reference to his encounter with organized crime in the 1980s that opens the first TV ad in his GOP campaign for Congress against 13th district Democratic Rep. Betty Sutton: "An organized crime syndicate was extorting money from his business, threatening his family, but he fought back and won the FBI's highest civilian award." PolitiFact Ohio earlier gave Ganley a rating of Barely True rating for his claim, in a Sept. 13 interview with The Plain Dealer’s editorial board, that he took down the mob in Northeast Ohio. That claim overstated his role. Truth be told, though, we felt bad about putting a mark against Ganley’s reputation in what is, by all accounts, a laudable act: endangering himself in the interest of justice. He was instrumental in helping the Justice Department put several dangerous criminals behind bars. We wondered whether his overstatement to the newspaper’s editorial board is how he has been portraying his role in the investigation to the public. Before we get to what we found, we note, in the interest of transparency, that Ganley is a major advertiser in The Plain Dealer. We did not find that Ganley has overstated his role in the investigation when speaking to the public, although others have. Generally, Ganley has portrayed his role the way he portrays it in his political ad: someone who helped the FBI with an investigation. Our reporting for the earlier PolitiFact item backs up what the TV ad says. Articles in The Plain Dealer archives show that two organized crime figures -- former Teamsters Union leader John J. (Skip) Felice and Joseph C. Ilaqua -- were sent to prison by U.S. District Judge Alvin I. Krenzler in July 1983 after pleading guilty to conspiring to extort $10,000 and a car from Ganley in 1981 and 1982. The indictment against Felice said he told Ganley in April 1981 that high ranking organized crime figures wanted Ganley killed, and that Felice could get the contract canceled in exchange for money. Ganley wore a wire when he met with the extortionists and asked questions at the FBI's request to help the bureau crack other cases, former FBI agents said. "During this investigation, it became evident to these organized crime members that Mr. Ganley was cooperating with the FBI and that he would be testifying against them at trial," says a 2007 press release the FBI issued when it gave Ganley its Louis E. Peters Memorial Service Award. "This realization resulted in additional death threats directed at Mr. Ganley and his family. Mr. Ganley refused to be intimidated by these criminals and consented to having FBI agents live at his residence to provide security for himself and his family." Retired FBI agents contacted by The Plain Dealer described Ganley’s actions as courageous and important to the FBI’s investigative strategy. We rate the claim in his television ad to be True.

pomt-07849	"In the month of January, Canada created more new jobs than we did."	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/feb/11/mitt-romney/mitt-romney-tells-cpac-canada-created-more-jobs-ja/	At the Conservative Political Action Conference, an annual pep rally for the political right, former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney complained that the economy had not recovered under President Barack Obama. He said, "Today there are more men and women out of work in America than there are people working in Canada. And in the month of January, Canada created more new jobs than we did." We’ll look separately at these two claims, which came from his CPAC speech on Feb. 11, 2011. In this item, we’ll analyze the claim that "in the month of January, Canada created more new jobs than we did." We found the relevant data for Canada at the website of Statistics Canada. For the month concluding in January 2011, Canada created a net 69,200 jobs. For the U.S. numbers, we turned to the Bureau of Labor Statistics and found Romney is correct. Over the same period, the U.S. created a net 36,000 jobs. So the U.S. created about half as many jobs even though it is nine times larger than Canada. It's worth noting that U.S. job growth was substantially stronger than Canadian job growth in each of the previous three months. In October, the U.S. economy created 171,000 jobs, compared to just 3,000 for Canada. In November 2010, the U.S. economy created 93,000 jobs, compared to 15,200 for Canada. And in December 2010, the U.S. created 121,000 jobs, compared to 22,000 for Canada. But on a per capita basis, in recent months U.S. job creation exceeded Canada's only in October. January happened to be a month when U.S. job creation was especially low and Canadian job creation was especially high, but it is the most recent month and it reflects the general pattern when you account for population.

pomt-10668	"Sixty-five percent of the Iraqi people now say it's okay to shoot an American soldier."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2007/dec/21/bill-richardson/he-hypes-the-language-the-numbers/	In a Democratic debate on Nov. 15, 2007, Bill Richardson had a startling way to support his view that the situation in Iraq is not improving: "What I'm saying, also, is that look at this statistic — 65 percent of the Iraqi people now say it's okay to shoot an American soldier." Where did that number come from? Katie Roberts, Richardson's deputy communications director, points to a BBC-sponsored poll of Iraqis in September 2007. BBC says the poll was conducted in face-to-face interviews with 2,212 people "in more than 450 neighborhoods across all 18 provinces of Iraq in August, and has a margin of error of plus or minus 2.5%." But the poll does not directly support the 65 percent figure. Nor does the poll put the question nearly as starkly as Richardson stated. "Thinking about the political action of other people," the question says, "do you find each of these items to be acceptable or not acceptable?" The first item was "attacks on coalition forces," and 57 percent of the respondents found them "acceptable." Among Sunnis, 93 percent said "acceptable;" among Shiites, it was 50 percent, and among Kurds, it was 5 percent. It's not at all clear that the same number would have said it is acceptable if people had been asked, "Is it okay to shoot an American soldier?" So Richardson is at least casting the response in more dramatic terms than the question interviewers asked. At the same time, the poll clearly suggests that about half of the Iraqi people consider attacks on coalition forces "acceptable." The Richardson campaign did not respond to our request to explain the disparity in numbers. Polling expert John G. Geer, professor of political science at Vanderbilt University and editor of the forthcoming Encyclopedia of Public Opinion, theorized that Richardson excluded the responses of Kurds. Sure enough, if you subtract the 354 Kurd responses from the 2,212 total, the math supports Richardson's 65 percent figure. This makes sense if you consider many Kurds would eventually like to have a state of their own. But removing the Kurds exaggerates the poll results and does not accurately reflect Richardson's statement, which referred only to "the Iraqi people." "The question," says Geer, "is whether 'attacks on coalition forces' equates to 'shooting an American soldier,' which of course it doesn't. Possibly they'd be more likely to say it's acceptable, I don't know." He adds, "It's generally a fair point to say Iraqis are unhappy with the American presence in Iraq. The general point has some validity, but he's exaggerated. That's what campaigns do." And what we do is call them on it. Richardson wasn't just "juicing the numbers," as Geer said. He was deliberately hyping the language and hyping the numbers to make a stronger point than the facts justified. The best we can rule is Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.

pomt-04883	"As president, Barack Obama has never visited Israel."	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/aug/07/mitt-romney/romney-says-obama-has-not-visited-israel-president/	Following a trip in which he said Israel was blessed by the hand of providence, Mitt Romney is out with an ad questioning President Barack Obama’s allegiance to the Jewish state. "Who shares your values?" a narrator asks as an image of Obama appears. "As president, Barack Obama has never visited Israel and refuses to recognize Jerusalem as its capital." Romney, the ad continues, "will be a different kind of president who stands by our allies. He knows America holds a deep and cherished relationship with Israel." The ad closes with clips of Romney giving a speech in front of the Old City and praying at the Western Wall. In another fact-check, we’ll look at the ad’s claims about Obama’s record on Jerusalem as the nation's capital. Here, we ask, has the president been there? Before he moved to the White House As an Illinois senator, Obama made his first visit to Israel in January of 2006. In 2008, while running for president, he returned on a multi-nation trip to Israel, Jordan, Germany, France and Britain. That trip, like Romney’s this year, was designed to bolster his foreign policy credentials. At the time, Obama declared America a friend of Israel and said we "must always stand up for Israel's right to defend itself." But Romney’s ad specified that Obama has not been to Israel "as president," and that assertion is correct. As it turns out, that’s not unusual. Our colleagues at the Washington Post’s Fact-Checker column delved into the archives of the historian’s office at the U.S. State Department. According to those records, seven of the last 11 presidents (dating back to Harry Truman who was in the White House when Israel was established) never visited Israel. The Obama campaign, when we asked for a response, pointed out that Republicans Ronald Reagan and George H. W. Bush were among those who never went to Israel. Democratic Presidents Jimmy Carter and Bill Clinton were the only ones to visit during their first term. George W. Bush went to Israel twice during his last year in office. That historical context is noteworthy: A majority of the last 11 presidents did not visit Israel. But the Romney ad’s claim is still accurate. We rate it True.

pomt-00714	Algeria "wanted to be taken off of the terror list" at the time it made an unreported donation to the Clinton Foundation.	false	/punditfact/statements/2015/apr/28/joe-scarborough/scarborough-says-algeria-donated-clinton-foundatio/	Television pundits are raising a lot of questions about foreign government donations to the Clinton Foundation during Hillary Clinton’s tenure as secretary of state. But not everyone get all the details right. Joe Scarborough of MSNBC’s Morning Joe flubbed describing the situation in the April 27 show. He was discussing a column by the Washington Post’s Ruth Marcus, whose op-ed highlighted an unreported donation to Bill Clinton’s foundation by Algeria in 2010 as an example of sloppiness. The donation, and others like it, raises questions about whether Clinton went "soft" on Algeria for contributing to her husband’s cause under the appearance of earthquake relief in Haiti, Marcus wrote. Scarborough said the situation will "stink to high heaven" even if it’s a legal gray area. "I think it was Algeria, maybe, that had given a donation that went unreported at a time when they wanted to be taken off of the terror list in the State Department," Scarborough said. "They write the check, they get taken off the terror list. ... At the same time, and then it goes unreported by the Clinton Foundation." "Is there a quid pro quo there? I don't know, that's really hard to tell," he said. Scarborough went on to break down to his panelists how easy it would be to explain to voters what might have occurred. "This is pretty simple stuff. So Algeria is on the terror list, they want off the terror list, the State Department's making a decision to do it, they write a check for what? How much? How many million dollars do they write a check for? I don't know, but Algeria writes a check. You're from Boston, you know how politics works. They write a really big check to the Clinton Foundation," Scarborough said. "The Clinton Foundation takes the check, and then just, out of nowhere the State Department then decides, well, they are going to take Algeria off the list. Now why did Algeria write a big check to the Clinton Foundation at the time they want something from the State Department? That's pretty simple for most voters." The problem with all of this isn’t the donation, or questions about a quid pro quo with Algeria. It’s the fact that Algeria wasn’t ever on the terror list. (Media Matters first pointed out what Scarborough said.) An ally against terror The list Scarborough mentions is a serious designation given to just four countries the State Department considers state sponsors of terrorism: Syria, Iran, Sudan and Cuba. President Barack Obama is poised to remove Cuba from the list as a show of improved diplomatic relations. (Libya, Iraq and North Korea are the only countries that have been removed.) Algeria is actually a key partner of the United States in fighting terrorism in North Africa and "has a long history of fighting terrorism," the State Department says. The country spent about 20 years locked in a civil war between the military and various Islamist groups after an Islamist group won a 1991 election that was scrapped. The country’s president, Abdelaziz Bouteflika, lifted a state of emergency in April 2011. But the country continues to struggle with radical violence in neighboring countries. Algeria was attacked by the group that calls itself al-Qaida in the Lands of the Islamic Maghreb almost 200 times in just 2013 in the form of improvised explosive devices, bombings, kidnappings, and fake roadblocks. Human rights violations hamper relations The Algerian government is not a state sponsor of terror. But its hands are not clean when it comes to human rights, which is most likely what Scarborough was trying to recall on air. The Washington Post story that revealed the Algerian embassy’s donation of $500,000 also mention that the one-time gift coincided with increased lobbying visits to the State Department about human rights violations. In 2010, Algeria spent more than $420,000 lobbying American officials on inter-country relations and on "human rights issues," the Post found, citing documents filed as part of the Foreign Agents Registration Act. The year also saw an increase in meetings between State Department officials and lobbyists representing Algeria, growing from "a handful" of recorded visits in the years before and after to 12 visits in 2010, the Post reported. The Algeria donation came soon after the Jan. 12, 2010, earthquake in Haiti, the Clinton Foundation said. It was unsolicited and went to the Clinton Foundation Haiti Relief Fund, "where the entire amount of Algeria’s contribution was distributed as aid in Haiti." Algeria had not donated before and has not donated since, a foundation spokesman said. The foundation acknowledged it did not alert the State Department about the gift for vetting, which was required under a memorandum of understanding between the Obama administration and the Clintons in an effort to prevent foreign governments from trying to curry favor with Hillary Clinton’s State Department by donating to Bill Clinton’s philanthropy. So what are the human rights issues Algeria was lobbying on? Reports by Human Rights Watch, Amnesty International and the State Department outline the activities of a strict authoritarian government that represses its people’s freedom of assembly and association, overuses pretrial detentions, and employs a judicial system that is susceptible to corruption. The State Department’s 2010 report of human rights issues in Algeria highlights more issues including reports of arbitrary killings, the government failing to account for people who disappeared during the civil war in the 1990s, violence and discrimination against women, and continued restrictions for workers’ rights. The government of Algeria has resisted inspections by independent human rights groups. MSNBC's Diana Rocco said Scarborough deserves some credit for indicating he "wasn’t sure it was" Algeria, and that the exchange that followed "clearly shows he’s using it as a hypothetical scenario to make his larger point about how the quid pro quo scenario may have unfolded." None of that, though, means that Algeria was on the terror watch list in the first place. Neither Algeria nor other governments revealed to have given to the foundation — Australia, the Dominican Republic, Kuwait, Norway, Oman and Qatar — are sponsors of terrorism, either. Our ruling Scarborough was trying to recall the details of a news story about Clinton Foundation donations from foreign governments when he brought up Algeria’s donation to the foundation to try getting off the "terror list." There are parts about the donations that may not look good for Clinton. Maybe it becomes a legal problem, maybe it’s just a political one. But to claim the foundation took donations from a country on the terrorist list is inaccurate. Scarborough’s claim rates False.

pomt-02381	In the U.S., "African-Americans continue to be arrested at nearly three and one half times the rate of whites" on marijuana charges.	true	/rhode-island/statements/2014/mar/16/naacp/new-england-naacp-says-african-americans-us-are-ar/	While there’s a growing debate over whether to legalize marijuana, some are troubled by what they see as unfairness in enforcement of existing laws. Among them is the New England Area Conference of the NAACP. The organization released a statement March 3 in support of a Rhode Island House bill that would legalize using marijuana or possessing up to an ounce. Currently, possession of an ounce or less of marijuana is a civil offense, punishable by a $150 fine. Among their reasons for supporting that change, the statement said, was that in the United States, African-Americans were 3.7 times more likely than whites to get arrested on marijuana charges, based on the number of arrests and their share of the nation’s population. James Vincent, president of the Providence NAACP, said the claim was based on a June 2013 report by the American Civil Liberties Union, "The War on Marijuana in Black and White." That report charted how many blacks and whites were arrested for marijuana possession and then, based on the racial population of each state, what the marijuana arrest rate per 100,000 people was for each race. The ACLU report used statistics compiled by the FBI’s Uniform Crime Reporting Program, a wide-ranging database of annual crime statistics that are often used in national crime studies because each state submits the same type of information, which allows apples-to-apples comparisons. Nationally, according to the report, the marijuana arrest rate for African-Americans in 2010 was 716 per 100,000, while for whites it was 192 per 100,000, meaning African-Americans were 3.7 times more likely to be arrested for marijuana possession. The disparities were present across the country; in some states, the arrest rate for African-Americans was as much as 8.3 times the white rate. In Rhode Island, before possession of small amounts of marijuana was decriminalized, the arrest rate for African-Americans was 524 per 100,000, while the rate for whites was 201 per 100,000. That meant African-Americans were 2.6 times more likely to be arrested on marijuana charges than their white fellow citizens. That Rhode Island disparity was specifically cited in the bill text as a proposed "legislative finding" justifying enactment of the legislation. The authors of the ACLU report cautioned the FBI data wasn’t perfect. They noted that the FBI didn’t count Latinos as a separate group, usually putting them in the ‘‘white’’ classification. That has the effect of preventing an accurate measurement of Latino arrests and inflating the number of white arrests, the report said. The authors said more research could be done to explore how other factors, such as past criminal records, age of the persons arrested or the population density of the location of the arrest might affect the arrest rates. The authors said they weren’t trying to prove or disprove a particular theory on why the disparities they found existed, just that the disparities were there. And they aren’t the first to study the issue. In 2009, Human Rights Watch, based in Washington, D.C., did a similar study, "Decades of Disparity, Drug Arrests and Race in the United States." While the ACLU study focused on marijuana possession arrests, the Human Rights Watch looked at all drug arrests by race from 1980 to 2007. Like the ACLU, Human Rights Watch used the FBI statistics and found arrest rates for blacks were multiple times higher than whites. In the last year it analyzed, 2007, it found African-Americans were 3.6 times more likely to be arrested on a drug charge, close to the ACLU’s 3.7 multiple for marijuana arrests in 2010. Our ruling The NAACP New England Area Conference said "African-Americans continue to be arrested at nearly three and one half times the rate of whites" on marijuana charges. The group accurately cited a nationwide study that used a widely accepted data source, and a similar study done a few years earlier found almost the same disparity. We find the statement True.

pomt-05239	"Women have come through the recession worse off than men … the numbers bear that out. We went from a 7 percent unemployment rate for women when he (President Barack Obama) was elected to an 8.1 percent now."	mostly true	/new-jersey/statements/2012/jun/04/caroline-casagrande/caroline-casagrande-says-women-have-come-through-r/	The recession and its aftereffects have been hard on millions of people across the country. But it’s been especially hard on women, according to state Assemblywoman Caroline Casagrande (R-Monmouth). "Women have come through the recession worse off than men … the numbers bear that out," Casagrande said to My9TV’s Brenda Blackmon on the April 29 "New Jersey Now" program. "We went from a 7 percent unemployment rate for women when he (President Barack Obama) was elected to an 8.1 percent now." Casagrande is correct about most of her data, PolitiFact New Jersey found. Obama was elected in November 2008 and took office on Jan. 20, 2009. Anita Velardo, Casagrande’s communications director, said in an e-mail that Casagrande’s statistic referred to the period from January 2009 to March 2012. But since Casagrande said elected, we’ll look at the unemployment rate for both periods. From November 2008 to March 2012, unemployment among women rose to 8.1 percent from 6.2 percent, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. For men, the rate climbed to 8.3 percent from 7.4 percent. From January 2009 to March 2012, unemployment for women rose from 7 percent to 8.1 percent. The rate for men, however, decreased from 8.6 percent to 8.3 percent. That’s because the male-dominated industries that lost jobs prior to January 2009 were starting to rebound. Now let’s look at data for the recession, which the nonprofit National Bureau of Economic Research said occurred from December 2007 to June 2009. During the recession, unemployment among women spiked from 4.9 percent to 8.3 percent. For men, the rate more than doubled, from 5.1 percent to 10.6 percent. Men’s unemployment was higher than women during the recession, but women have had a tougher time getting work and living day-to-day during the ongoing economic recovery, according to a September 2011 report, "Women and Men Living on the Edge: Economic Insecurity After the Great Recession," prepared by the Institute For Women’s Policy Research and funded by the Rockefeller Foundation. Economic and labor experts we talked with supported Casagrande’s claim. Male-dominated fields such as construction and manufacturing often are hit first in recessions and tend to rebound first during an economic recovery, according to Elisabeth Jacobs, a Governance Studies fellow at the Brookings Institution; Gary Burtless, a senior fellow in Economic Studies at Brookings; and Harry Holzer, a professor of Public Policy at Georgetown University. Female-dominated fields such as education, public sector jobs and retail often are hit later and rebound slower, they said. "In terms of lost jobs, men suffered worse than women and have seen a bigger drop in their employment rate," said Burtless, who contributed $750 to Obama’s campaign in 2011 but also was an adviser on aspects of labor policy to the presidential campaign of Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.). "In terms of the number of adults who are still looking for work, women’s situation looks (proportionately) a bit worse than that of men." "The recovery has progressed more slowly for women than for men, and the unemployment rate for women is indeed higher today than it was when President Obama was elected president," Jacobs said in an e-mail. But is Obama to blame? Our colleagues at PolitiFact.com addressed this issue in April after Mitt Romney’s campaign claimed women were hit hard by job losses under Obama. Their report showed that women have had a more difficult jobs recovery than men, but Obama cannot bear all the blame, just as he couldn’t take the credit if jobs were booming when he took office. Our ruling Casagrande said, "women have come through the recession worse off than men … the numbers bear that out. We went from a 7 percent unemployment rate for women when he was elected to an 8.1 percent now." Labor statistics show and some experts told us that while men took the brunt of job loss during the recession, the industries they dominate – construction and manufacturing – tend to bounce back first during economic recovery. Women often are affected much later than men during a recession, meaning they are more likely to have a slower rate of gaining employment. Casagrande’s timeframe is off slightly for the statistic she cited, and Obama can’t be held completely responsible for the slow recovery among women. We rate Casagrande’s statement Mostly True.

Recently a New Boston reader reached out to PolitiFact New Hampshire with a campaign mailer he received from Speaker of the House Bill O’Brien R-Mont Vernon this summer. The material was one of many tools incumbents are employing in a tussle for party control of the statehouse in 2013. "When Republicans took over the legislature in 2010, we inherited a tax rate for employers that was 50th -- dead last -- in the nation," O’Brien said. "Add to that one of the most intense regulatory state government structures in the country, and it was no wonder that the unemployment rate had more than doubled since the Democrats took power four years prior." Along with this excerpt, our reader had a simple request: "Would you be willing to crunch the numbers here?" We were happy to oblige. First, we reached out to O’Brien through his campaign email and phone number, but we heard nothing back. We broke his claim into two parts, and reached out to The Tax Foundation and the New Hampshire Employment Security for some answers. The Tax Foundation, a business-backed policy group, offered some guidance for the part of the claim where O’Brien speaks about New Hampshire’s "tax rate for employers" in 2010. That year New Hampshire ranked 50th on The Tax Foundation's corporate tax index, according to economist Scott Drenkard. Every year The Tax Foundation takes an "all-encompassing" look at the entire tax system of a state, Drenkard said, breaking it into five subcategories: corporate, income, sales, unemployment insurance, and property taxes. "The word ‘rate’ is concerning to me because it’s not exactly what it looks at," Drenkard said. "The rate is only part of this story." Drenkard pointed us to a New Hampshire Watch Dog article that broke down the Tax Foundation’s ranking at the time. As part of the study, New Hampshire ranked 7th best for overall business tax climate, and had been 7th since 2007. In 2006, the Granite State was 6th. "New Hampshire’s economic competitiveness was dragged down in the rankings by its worst in the nation corporate tax policy," according to the article. "The rate is fairly high," Drenkard said. "That's part of the component there. There's a business profits tax and New Hampshire limits carryforwards, one of the things that's an important part of the base." New Hampshire also got "dinged" in 2010 for offering credits for creating jobs, as well as research and development credits and investment credits, which The Tax Foundation scores as negative in its corporate tax policy, Drenkard added. "Those, for the most part, mixed with the high rate, ended up putting it in 50th in 2010," Drenkard said. "In general, the spirit of what he’s trying to say is certainly true. We rank it as one of the worst corporate tax structures in the country." State legislatures write the laws that impact tax structure, Drenkard said. But it’s important to note that in 2012 -- under a Republican-controlled legislature -- the Granite State only hits 46th in its corporate tax rank compared to the rest of the country. Each Tax Foundation study is considered exclusive to the year in which it is conducted and should not be compared with previous ranks, Drenkard said. "For the most part, I don’t remember hearing any fantastic corporate tax reforms from New Hampshire at least recently," Drenkard said. "So the story is it was bad in 2010 and for the most part is still one of our lowest ranked corporate tax codes." As for the Granite State’s unemployment statistics, O’Brien is fairly accurate on the numbers by themselves. "Roughly, you could say it doubled," Annette Nielsen, an economist for New Hampshire Employment Security said. Looking at 2006 generally -- four years prior to Republicans taking over the state legislature in November 2010 -- unemployment was in the 3.4-3.7 percent range, Nielsen said. It stayed that way through May 2008, she added. In November and December that year, the recession hit, and state unemployment numbers started rising. By December 2008 the unemployment was 4.8 percent. By October 2009 it peaked at 6.7 percent and stayed that way through January 2010. Not quite the "more than doubled" number O’Brien cited, but close. New Hampshire’s increasing unemployment rate followed nationwide trends, Nielsen said. "The nation was at a much higher rate, it peaked in October at 10.1 or 10.2 percent," Nielsen said. "It followed the general trend of the nation." Are Democrats to blame for the increased unemployment figures? "Whether it could be better or worse, that's kind of a little more individual -- what people maybe feel," Nielsen said. "There are some forces that are national that have an impact. New Hampshire is not an island by itself. It’s part of the nation and there were some greater forces that were taking place at that time." Dennis Delay, an economist with the N.H. Center for Public Policy Studies, an independent nonprofit that pursues data-based research on public policy matters, agreed. Unemployment increased in New Hampshire as a result of the Great Recession, he said. "States with Republican legislatures also saw unemployment rates rise substantially after 2007, because of the worldwide financial crisis and its impact on local economies," Delay added. He provided a graph of job losses in the U.S. and compared it to New Hampshire, which shows the spike in job losses nationwide during that period of time. "The situation in New Hampshire looks similar, although New Hampshire did not lose as many jobs in percentage terms as the U.S.," Delay added. Our ruling: O’Brien said that when Republicans took over the state legislature in 2010, the state's tax rate for employers was last in the nation, and unemployment had more than doubled under Democrats. We find he generalized a 2010 tax study, zeroing in on New Hampshire’s corporate tax rate, when several other factors contribute to The Tax Foundation’s corporate tax index for New Hampshire. And he failed to mention that New Hampshire’s corporate tax rank is still in the same ballpark in 2012. O’Brien used accurate unemployment figures comparing 2006 to 2010, but the numbers have more to do with the Great Recession than with the people (or the party) running the state. O’Brien was on target with the rank and rates he cited, but there is context missing and misplaced blame. We rate his claim Half True.

pomt-01919	Says 95 percent of people caught crossing the U.S.-Mexico border said in a survey "we are coming because we’ve been promised amnesty."	half-true	/texas/statements/2014/jun/29/ted-cruz/ted-cruz-accurately-recaps-survey-result-indicatin/	People have increasingly crossed into Texas over the Rio Grande because they think Uncle Sam has open arms, U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas said the other day. Cruz, at a San Antonio press conference with fellow Republicans Texas Attorney General Greg Abbott and U.S. Rep. Michael Burgess, said a May 2014 government survey of over 200 people apprehended trying to enter the country illegally proves his point. Asked "why are you coming here?," Cruz said, "95 percent said we are coming because we’ve been promised amnesty. We are coming because if we get here, we were told that we are allowed to stay, that we will have a permiso." We wondered if most recent arrivals are citing expectations of amnesty. Record crossings Tens of thousands of people, including children mostly from Central American countries, have been crossing the border, resulting in a record number of non-Mexicans getting apprehended. Accounts have varied on why more are coming than before. For instance, a June 16, 2014, National Journal news story quoted Leslie Velez, a senior protection officer at the U.N. High Commission for Refugees, as saying its 2014 interviews of 404 children revealed many were fleeing violence and crime in their home countries. Survey says... And what was Cruz citing? By email, Cruz spokeswoman Catherine Frazier pointed out June 2014 news stories in The Washington Post and the Washington Examiner summarizing a Border Patrol survey reportedly brought to light in an undated document Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, placed into the records of the Senate Judiciary Committee at a June 2014 hearing. A copy of Grassley’s document, emailed to us by Texas Sen. John Cornyn’s office, describes May 2014 interviews of adults and children by Border Patrol officers in the agency’s Rio Grande Valley sector. By telephone, Grassley spokeswoman Beth Pellett Levine said the senator knows a whistleblower summarized the interviews, though she said that as of June 24, 2014, Homeland Security hadn’t confirmed or denied the document’s authenticity. By email, a Del Rio-based Border Patrol spokesman, Dennis Smith, declined to comment on the four-page document. According to the document, the agents interviewed 230 adults and unaccompanied children from El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala on May 28, 2014. The focus, the document says, was to "obtain a general consensus as to why" the border crossers "are migrating en masse" into the country through the Rio Grande Valley. The word "amnesty" doesn’t appear in the summary of results. Also, the document says in many cases, "the subjects mentioned more than one reason," including gang-related violence, extreme poverty, high unemployment, poor living conditions and subpar educational circumstances -- with many women mentioning domestic abuse. Still, the document says, the main reason interviewed individuals "chose this particular time to migrate" was to "take advantage of the ‘new’ U.S. ‘law’ that grants a ‘free pass’ or permit (referred to as ‘permisos’) being issued by the U.S. government to female adult" non-Mexicans "traveling with minors and to" unaccompanied children." The document says the issue of "permisos" was the "main reason provided by 95% (+/-) of the interviewed subjects." The document doesn’t confirm any new law and we’re unaware of any. Confusingly, too, the document says the permisos are "Notice to Appear" documents, but it also says those documents aren’t free passes to stay in the country. Rather, the document says, the notices are routinely issued to undocumented entrants "when they are released on their own recognizance pending a hearing before an immigration judge." The document goes on to say the granting of permisos "is apparently common knowledge in Central America and is spread by word of mouth, and international and local media. A high percentage of the subjects interviewed stated their family members in the U.S. urged them to travel immediately, because the United States government was only issuing ‘permisos’ until the end of June 2014," while several people said they’d heard they’d be issued only through May 2014, the document says. Most unaccompanied children, the document says, stated they were going to join a parent or parents or other family members already in the country. The children "stated they wanted to take advantage of the ‘permiso’ being issued by the U.S. government to minors traveling alone." Many children cited high crime in their countries and forced recruitment into gangs, the document says, with others mentioning educational opportunities in the U.S. Outside lawyers: ‘It’s not amnesty’ To our telephone inquiries, immigration lawyers who looked over the Grassley-publicized document offered different interpretations of the references to permisos. Each one also said it would be inaccurate to interpret the permisos as amnesty, as in passes to remain in the country without risk of being deported or other penalties. Elizabeth Lee Young of the University of Arkansas School of Law, who emailed us a "Notice to Appear" document, characterized it as an immigration court summons. "Most of the people know it’s a notice to go to court," Young said. Anyone who doesn’t show up for their court date, she said, is subject to immediate deportation. Significantly, Young said, no one caught after crossing is given a work permit, which is how she said she usually interprets "permiso." Detainees given a notice near the border, the lawyers told us, can then be held in a government facility or released deeper into the country on personal recognizance -- as children and women with children often are, the lawyers said. Toni Maschler, a Washington, D.C., attorney, said generally, she considers a permiso a permit, like a driver’s license, and not the notice to appear for an immigration hearing. Maschler speculated the document’s references to permisos were really to the document that releases someone on their own recognizance. Lisa Brodyaga, a lawyer in San Benito, close to the Texas-Mexico border, similarly said the document’s references to permisos probably mean paperwork related to releases on personal recognizance, which she said clear the way for women and unaccompanied children to leave the border region; men, for the most part, she said, are kept in detention. Each release "allows you to get out of detention, allows you to travel, it allows you to go be with your family," Brodyaga said, "and, as long as you go to your hearings when you have them, it allows you to stay in the United States. It’s a ‘permit,’ until you get deported." "It’s nowhere near amnesty," Brodyaga said, which would mean "you are forgiven for something. You’re not forgiven. You’re subject to the laws of the United States… This does not entitle them to remain indefinitely." Similarly, Maschler said the release on personal recognizance is "not amnesty. It doesn’t give anybody a permanent right to stay in the United States." Young said: "Amnesty would indicate some form of legal waiver of your undocumented presence or entry. That is not the situation." Apprised of the lawyers’ assessments, Cruz’s spokeswoman said by email Cruz didn’t say that any legal papers deliver amnesty to border crossers. The point is people are coming because they think they’ll be allowed to stay, as they have been, Frazier said. Our ruling Cruz said a survey indicates 95 percent of people caught crossing the U.S.-Mexico border said "we are coming because we’ve been promised amnesty." This statement accurately recaps a statistic in a document made public by another senator: 95 percent of 230 adults and unaccompanied children interviewed recently by the Border Patrol gave as the main reason for their journeys the U.S. government issuing permisos, which the document defines as notices to appear in immigration court enabling recipients to stay in the country at least until then. But that’s not "amnesty," as in an absolution enabling people to stay indefinitely without risk of penalty, and indeed "amnesty" goes unmentioned in the survey summary. Also, as unsaid by Cruz, the immigrants listed other reasons for coming, including crime and violence in home countries. The document, with its anonymous origins, doesn’t specify how many individuals singled out these other factors. Another study, in which the United Nations earlier surveyed twice as many immigrants, pointed to gang violence as the vital factor. We rate this claim, which is partly accurate but leaves out relevant details, as Half True.

pomt-10671	"I can't sign money. That's illegal."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2007/dec/19/hillary-clinton/if-shes-right-bills-a-criminal/	During a campaign stop at a supermarket in Des Moines, Iowa, Hillary Clinton was asked by a shopper to autograph a dollar bill. She refused. "I can't sign money. That's illegal," Clinton said, according to a CBS News video of the exchange. "I'm so sorry." The shopper then showed reporters the dollar, which had apparently been autographed by Clinton's husband. "Well," the shopper said, "Bill signed it." So let's explore whether Sen. Clinton is correct, which would implicate her husband in a federal crime. In fact, the Treasury Department says "defacement of currency" is against the law. The law specifies that "whoever mutilates, cuts, disfigures, perforates, unites or cements together, or does any other thing to any bank bill, draft, note, or other evidence of debt issued by any national banking association, Federal Reserve Bank, or Federal Reserve System, with intent to render such item(s) unfit to be reissued, shall be fined not more than $100 or imprisoned not more than six months, or both." But if Bill is busted for violating Title 18, Section 333, then the feds will also have to prosecute some other prominent law-breakers, including treasury secretaries who have routinely autographed dollar bills, which are printed with their signatures. Like so many laws, this one becomes a matter of interpretation. In this case, it's a question of whether an autograph is a deliberate attempt to deface a bill so it can't be used again. The Treasury Department doesn't think so and says autographing dollar bills is permitted. A department fact sheet says, "Throughout the years, the Secretary of the Treasury and the Treasurer of the United States have autographed currency notes bearing their signatures at the request of private citizens. This practice is not considered as defacement since the autographs are generally provided to persons as keepsakes as opposed to circulating currency." Claudia Dickens, a spokeswoman for the Bureau of Engraving and Printing, said it only becomes a violation when it is mutilated so much that it is" unacceptable to a merchant or vending machine. That's defacing." She said autographing "is certainly not something that the Department of Treasury encourages, but it's not disallowed." And so we find that although Clinton's statement has a germ of truth because defacing dollars is illegal, she is wrong about an innocent autograph. She could have signed that buck without fear of prosecution. We find her statement Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.	None	Hillary Clinton	None	None	None	2007-12-19T00:00:00	2007-12-18	['None']
pomt-04279	Says during George W. Bush’s administration "we were losing millions of jobs per month," while under Barack Obama we have "three years of gaining hundreds of thousands of jobs per month."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/nov/02/michael-moore/michael-moore-said-us-lost-millions-jobs-month-und/	On the day of the final release of jobs numbers before the presidential election, liberal filmmaker Michael Moore tweeted a comparison of how the job market has fared under President Barack Obama and his predecessor, President George W. Bush. "Under Bush we were LOSING MILLIONS of jobs per month; under Obama we have 3 yrs of gaining hundreds of thousands of jobs per mo," Moore tweeted to his 1.2 million followers. Were Moore’s figures correct? No -- in fact, Moore conceded so himself when he sent a corrected tweet about five hours later. Let's look at the numbers. Job losses under Bush We turned to data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the government’s official collector of employment numbers. Since Moore didn’t specify what types of jobs he was referring to, we took the most basic measure -- private sector jobs combined with government jobs, not counting farm jobs or the military. During Bush’s final year -- the year with the heaviest job losses during his tenure -- the monthly net change in jobs bottomed out in the fourth quarter. Between October 2008 and November 2008, the economy shed 803,000 jobs. Between November 2008 and December 2008, the economy lost 661,000 jobs. And between January 2009 and December 2008, the economy lost 818,000 -- the highest number of Bush’s tenure (and higher than any monthly loss under Obama). That’s a huge number, but it’s not "MILLIONS." In fact, it’s not even 1 million. So Moore’s tweet exaggerated the size of the losses under Bush. Job gains under Obama The job picture did eventually improve under Obama, but Moore exaggerates when he says the economy has been gaining hundreds of thousands of jobs per month for the last three years under Obama. During 2010, the job market expanded by an average of 85,000 per month. In 2011, the average rose to 153,000 per month. And in 2012, the average rose again, to 157,000 per month. Those numbers are a whole lot better than what the nation experienced in 2008, but these rises don’t qualify as "hundreds of thousands," which we would define as at least 200,000. What about increases above 200,000 during individual months? Looking at the 34 months since January 2010, the net increase has exceeded 200,000 jobs a total of 10 times, or less than one-third of the time. And several of those were months where the job numbers were boosted only temporarily due to a flurry of hiring for the once-a-decade U.S. Census. Moore's correction About five hours after Moore's original tweet was posted, and after we had contacted his office, he sent a tweet correcting the record. "Thx for tweets on job loss - worst month w/Bush was 800K+ jobs lost, most months since '10 have had 100K+ jobs gained http://mmflint.me/QbEkPM." Moore's second tweet was correct. Our ruling Moore's initial tweet was incorrect when it said the nation was "losing millions" of jobs per month under Bush, since even the weakest month under Bush saw the economy lose less than 1 million jobs per month. And he was also incorrect to say that the economy has been "gaining hundreds of thousands of jobs" per month for three years under Obama. The economy has averaged well under 200,000 jobs per month during that period and only exceeded the job-gain threshold of 200,000 in 10 months. We applaud his correction, but we still rate his initial tweet False.	None	Michael Moore	None	None	None	2012-11-02T16:49:39	2012-11-02	['Barack_Obama', 'George_W._Bush']
pomt-14527	Travis County residents "trusted me to take on Tom DeLay — and we won."	mostly false	/texas/statements/2016/feb/17/gary-cobb/gary-cobb-won-guilty-jury-verdicts-against-tom-del/	It’s no secret: A Democratic candidate for Travis County district attorney starred in the high-profile prosecution of a felled U.S. House majority leader found guilty of campaign finance violations. A May 2015 Austin American-Statesman news story summed up: "Travis County prosecutor Gary Cobb persuaded jurors in 2010 that former U.S. House Majority Leader Tom DeLay had illegally channeled corporate funds to Texas candidates." Still, an adviser to one of Cobb’s opponents in the March 2016 primary asked us to gauge a TV ad posted on Cobb’s campaign website. In the spot, Cobb faces the camera and says: "You trusted me to take on Tom DeLay — and we won." By email, Jeff Crosby, an adviser to candidate Margaret Moore, noted that while a local jury found DeLay guilty, his convictions were thrown out on appeal. We asked Katie Naranjo, a consultant to Cobb’s campaign, about Cobb’s victory statement. By email, Naranjo told us Cobb "was entrusted as lead trial lawyer" in DeLay’s trial "and Gary (and his trial team, other attorneys, investigators and support staff—that is, ‘we’) won the trial." Naranjo acknowledged the convictions were overturned. Still, she wrote, "Gary was not the appellate lawyer, which was another team. Trial lawyers often win a trial, and then that result might get overturned on appeal. That doesn’t mean that the trial lawyers didn’t win the trial." News accounts Let’s revisit the DeLay turning points as depicted in Statesman news stories, starting with the trial. In November 2010, eight years after the county launched its investigation, a jury found DeLay, then 63, guilty of laundering corporate money into political donations during the 2002 elections. His indictment on the charges earlier led him to give up the leadership post; next, he left the House. From the Statesman account of the verdict: DeLay, a Republican whose nickname was "The Hammer" because of his heavy-handed leadership style, was accused of conspiring to funnel $190,000 of corporate money through the Republican National Committee, which sent $190,000 in campaign donations to seven GOP candidates for the Texas House. Prosecutors argued that DeLay conspired to launder corporate money into political donations as the first step in creating a GOP majority in the Texas House. It later redrew the state's congressional districts to favor Republicans, which prosecutors said bolstered DeLay's hold on his leadership post in Washington. State law prohibits corporations from giving donations to candidates directly or indirectly. Prosecutors earlier said they thought the DeLay case is the first such criminal charge ever filed over the state's century-old law on corporate contributions in state political races. In January 2011, DeLay was sentenced to three years in prison. But he also was released on a $10,000 bond pending appeals avowed by his lead trial lawyer, Dick DeGuerin. Cobb's role Cobb appears to have led the county’s courtroom team. A web search led us to a 2011 commentary by Rob Kepple of the Texas District & County Attorneys Association stating Cobb was part of a "seasoned team" of prosecutors in DeLay’s trial including Beverly Mathews, Steven Brand and Holly Taylor. Separately to our inquiry, the Travis County district attorney, Rosemary Lehmberg, said Cobb was the county’s lead counsel in the trial. Lehmberg said: "He was not as active in the appeals process," specifying that Taylor steered that task. Appeals courts On Sept. 19, 2013, the state’s 3rd Court of Appeals sided with DeLay and overturned the convictions won by Cobb. In a 2-1 ruling that broke along party lines, the judges said the prosecution had failed to prove "proceeds of criminal activity." It further noted that the jury on two occasions had asked trial Judge Pat Priest whether the $190,000 was "illegal at the start of the transaction" or "procured by illegal means originally." And, the court said, prosecutors didn’t prove that point — a critical element to conspiring to launder money — and the judge never answered the jurors’ questions. More than a year passed. But on Oct. 1, 2014, the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals, splitting 8-1 along party lines, upheld the lower court. DeLay’s political committee could legally donate corporate money to the Republican National Committee and the national organization could legally make political donations to Texas candidates, the court found, and the agreement to swap money didn’t constitute conspiracy -- and DeLay didn’t "knowingly" violate the law. District attorney comments At the time, Lehmberg said in a written statement the court had effectively repealed the state law prohibiting corporate donations to candidates and placed an impossible burden on the state to prosecute violators of the ban. "The decision undermines the fairness and integrity of our elections," she said. For this fact check, we asked Lehmberg if Travis County "won" against DeLay. She credited Cobb with winning at trial. But, she said by phone, "ultimately, we didn’t" prevail. Our ruling Cobb says Travis County residents "trusted me to take on Tom DeLay--and we won." Cobb and the county won a jury verdict against DeLay. However, the convictions were tossed by an appeals court; its ruling was upheld by the state's highest criminal court of appeals. We rate Cobb's claim Mostly False. MOSTLY FALSE – The statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression.

pomt-10929	Says he’s "never voted ‘present’ in the House instead of taking a yes or no position.	true	/texas/statements/2018/jul/26/roger-williams/roger-williams-says-hes-never-voted-present-us-hou/	U.S. Rep. Roger Williams, who represents the 25th Congressional District running north and west from Austin to just south of Tarrant County, declared that he always commits to a position on issues before the House--never voting "present" the "chicken way." A reader asked us to fact-check Williams's tout. Williams, a former Texas secretary of state who faces Democratic nominee Julie Oliver on the November 2018 ballot, was asked by Maria Bartiromo, who hosts the Fox Business Network’s "Mornings with Maria," why some Democratic colleagues had voted "present" instead of "yes" or "no" on a House-approved resolution. The measure expressed support for officers who carry out the mission of Immigration & Customs Enforcement, the agency that some Democrats lately say should be disbanded. The House vote on the resolution was 244-35 with 18 Democrats joining Republicans favoring the proposal and 34 voting against it, The Hill reported--with another 133 Democrats voting "present" as urged by Democratic leaders. The leadership "strategy was aimed at both protecting vulnerable Democrats from a contentious vote," The Hill said, "and protesting what most Democrats deemed a political stunt designed to distract the media and the public from Congress’s failure to enact immigration reforms, including efforts to address the separation of migrant families on the U.S.-Mexico border," its story said. The morning after the House action, Bartiromo asked Williams: "How do you justify voting ‘present?’" Williams replied: "Well, I never voted ‘present.’ So I don’t know that I can justify it. It’s the chicken way out is the only way I know we can put it." Checking vote histories We didn’t divine a way to plumb a government website to determine if Williams, who joined the House in 2013, had never voted "present." But to our inquiry, Joshua Tauberer, founder of GovTrack.us, a site that compiles congressional votes, confirmed Williams’s statement. Tauberer said by email that Williams, who as of late July 2018 had been eligible to vote in 3,604 roll-call votes, "has never voted ‘present,’ except in quorum calls where ‘present’ is the only vote one can make." Tauberer told us he reached his conclusion by querying the site’s internal database of votes, which he described as built in part from member votes posted by the House clerk. We were curious too about other Texas members voting "present." On that front, Tauberer emailed us a spreadsheet showing more than 1,900 "present" votes by Texans since 1990, though most weren’t substantive, we found. We sifted the provided information to find that 26 Texas members, from both parties, accounted for more than 680 non-procedural votes of "present" since 1990 with Rep. Eddie Bernice Johnson, D-Dallas, leading the delegation with 84 votes of "present" followed by Democratic Rep. Gene Green of Houston, with 61. According to our sort, Republican Rep. Joe Barton of Ennis placed third with 59 "present" votes; he was trailed by GOP Reps. Sam Johnson of Plano and Lamar Smith of San Antonio, with 57 "present" votes each, and Democratic Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee of Houston, who voted "present" 50 times. We sifted the information even more to find that since Williams joined the House in 2013, 11 House Democrats had voted "present" 20 times across nine issues -- topped by Rep. Joaquin Castro, D-San Antonio, doing so five times. Most recently, the results show, Reps. Green and Vicente Gonzalez of McAllen each voted "present" on the ICE resolution that Williams supported. Since 2013, the information indicates, no Texas Republicans in the House voted "present" on non-procedural issues. Outside analyst Finally, we asked an expert on Congress generally about the prevalence and significance of "present" votes. Steven Smith, a Washington University political scientist, said by email that party strategy or an individual’s political calculation often underlie the semi-rare "present" votes. "At times, a legislator may want to avoid committing to the ‘yea’ or ‘nay’ position without reducing his or her rate of voting participation," Smith wrote. "The legislator will be counted as having voted but without having committed to either side. This probably can be rationalized as having unacceptable alternatives, but it avoids adding a vote for or against a cause, group or constituency," Smith said.

pomt-13924	Austin was the "site of the first mass shooting in the country."	false	/texas/statements/2016/jun/23/steve-adler/steve-adler-wrong-first-us-mass-shooting-occurred-/	Austin’s mayor struck a grim historical note when asked if he could help people understand the June 2016 shooting rampage that took 49 lives in a gay club in Orlando. "For me it’s beyond understanding," Steve Adler replied on KOKE-FM’s morning program a couple of days after the carnage. "It’s the kind of thing that could happen anywhere, though. You know," Adler said, "Austin was ... the site of the first mass shooting in the country, from that tower, that was the very first one." Adler was referring to the Aug. 1, 1966, acts of University of Texas student Charles Whitman, whose shots from atop UT’s iconic Main Building ultimately took 14 lives, wounding 31; he’d earlier stabbed to death his wife and mother. Whitman’s fusillade ended when he was shot and killed at short range. KOKE host Bob Cole followed up, asking Adler if he was saying Whitman represented "the first mass shooting in our country." "That’s what I’m told," Adler replied. "First one." No doubt, Whitman holds broad significance. Texas author Gary Lavergne’s 1997 book, "A Sniper in the Tower: The Charles Whitman Murders," says: "With deadly efficiency, he introduced America to public mass murder, and in the process forever changed our notions of safety in open spaces." Before 1966, Lavergne wrote, "mass murder was so rare that the" criminal justice "system had no special category or documentation for it. Statistics and prosecutors had treated such criminals and their crimes in the same manner as a single murder." However, mass shootings take in far more events than Adler acknowledged, making this Austin-was-first statement incorrect. Adler spokesman concedes error Mayoral spokesman Jason Stanford owned up to error when we inquired into the basis of Adler’s statement. By email, Stanford said he’d given the mayor the "first mass shooting" conclusion based on what he’d personally heard since moving to Austin in the 1990s. Next, we looked at news stories fetched from electronic archives, finding that the Austin American-Statesman didn’t deem Whitman the nation’s first mass shooter, at least in recent decades. Rather, a July 1991 American-Statesman news story called the day’s events "one of the worst mass killings in American history." Later in 1991, the Associated Press recapped the death of Richard Speck, who "shocked the nation in 1966 by stabbing and strangling eight student nurses" in a night. That story quoted James Alan Fox, then dean of Northeastern University’s College of Criminal Justice, saying the Speck slayings marked the start of America's "age of mass murder. Mass murder was not something that was in our vocabulary until Richard Speck," Fox said. Whitman, the story noted, fired from the UT Tower two weeks after the Speck murders. Defining mass shootings That story's mention of Fox prompted us to seek the professor’s analysis of Adler’s statement. By phone, Fox reminded us that a mass shooting has conventionally been defined as one involving four or more deaths by gunfire, not counting military operations or shoot-outs connected to gang activity or other crimes, all in the same one-day period--a definition he sticks with, he said, for the sake of comparisons over time. That definition is in keeping with a 2008 FBI report stating that over the previous three decades, a mass murder was defined as four or more murders occurring during the same incident, with no distinctive time period between the murders--though later, a 2012 law set the federal threshold for a "mass killing" as three or more people killed, we noted in a January 2016 fact check. Yet there’s room for other definitions and a narrower term. By email, Fox noted a Stanford University database of U.S. mass shootings launched after the 2012 Sandy Hook shootings. The Stanford project advises: "Instead of limiting our data collection to incidents in which four or more fatalities occurred (the previous FBI definition for mass murder), we instead collect incidents of three or more shooting victims (not necessarily fatalities). All mass shooting definitions are arbitrary in that there is no natural way to quantify such an event." In June 2016, Stanford’s database, which chronologically starts with the Whitman shootings, listed more than 300 incidents fulfilling its "mass shooting" definition, most recently an April 2016 drive-by incident in Missouri that left four people injured. Mass public shootings To our inquiries, Fox and Grant Duwe, author of a book on mass murder in the U.S. and director of research and evaluation for the Minnesota Department of Corrections, each noted another term with a slightly different definition--"mass public shootings." A 2013 Congressional Research Service report defined such shootings as "incidents occurring in relatively public places, involving four or more deaths—not including the shooter(s)—and gunmen who select victims somewhat indiscriminately." Whitman, Fox suggested to us, accounted for the first mass public shooting on a college campus and the largest to that time. A memorable previous public mass shooting, Fox said, occurred in September 1949 when Howard Unruh shot and killed 13 people, including three children, in a 20-minute stroll through his neighborhood in Camden, N.J., according to Unruh’s October 2009 obituary in the New York Times. Duwe said in an October 2014 article in Reason that he’d identified 161 U.S. mass public shootings since 1900, "which I've defined as incidents that occur in the absence of other criminal activity (e.g., robberies, drug deals, gang ‘turf wars,’ et cetera) in which a gun was used to kill four or more victims at a public location within a 24-hour period." And from 1900 until Whitman acted, Duwe told us by phone, there were 30 U.S. public mass shootings. His break-out, provided by email, showed pre-Whitman mass public shootings in 20 states--all but two resulting in less than 10 deaths. "Even though they didn’t match the number of victims killed or wounded in the UT-Austin shooting," Duwe said, "they certainly qualify as mass public shootings." According to the compilation, two pre-Whitman shooters caused more than a dozen deaths: Unruh and Frank Gonzalez, a California man who shot pilots on a passenger plane in May 1964; 43 people perished. A caution Generally, Fox and Duwe each cautioned against getting bogged down in assessments of first or worst mass shootings partly because, due to the limits of the commonly accepted definition, incidents such as the Saint Valentine’s Day and Wounded Knee massacres get parsed out. "This whole thing of what’s the largest," Fox said, "is really an absurd exercise as if any of these episodes would be any less tragic if wasn’t the largest." Whitman, he added, "certainly did for many many years embody what Americans thought of when they heard mass murder." Our ruling Adler said Austin was the "site of the first mass shooting in the country." The UT tragedy appears to have been the nation’s first mass public shooting on a college campus. But there were 30 mass shootings--mass murders of four or more individuals in a 24-hour period--just in the 60-plus years before Whitman acted. We rate the statement False.

pomt-05299	Says New Jersey’s prison system is "61 percent African-American even though our state is just 13 percent black."	true	/new-jersey/statements/2012/may/21/cory-booker/cory-booker-said-black-people-represent-more-60-pe/	If the United States wants to secure a future as a leading democracy, it must invest in its children, according to Newark Mayor Cory Booker. But right now the country is failing to live up to its potential, Booker said in a speech at a May 4 forum held by the American Federation for Children, a group that advocates for school choice. At the end of his speech, Booker, talking about "the carnage that happens when we fail to live up to the promise of this nation," told a story about the death of a boy he knew when he first took office in 2006. While recounting that story, Booker stopped himself and said: "I know the data. I see what's happening to young minority men in this country. I see how much, when looking from a financial perspective how much we as taxpayers pay, billions of dollars in New Jersey for a prison system or correctional system that doesn't correct. Recycling the same people over and over and over again. A prison system that is 61 percent African-American even though our state is just 13 percent black." PolitiFact New Jersey checked Booker’s statistics on the state’s prison population and found that he knows the data well. New Jersey housed 23,810 people in all of its correctional facilities, including halfway houses and county jails, as of Jan. 3, according to data from the state department of corrections. Of those nearly 24,000 offenders, 61 percent, or 14,469 people, are black. By comparison, 22 percent, or 5,300 inmates, are white and 16 percent, or 3,785 inmates, are Hispanic. New Jersey’s prison population, excluding offenders held in a facility for women and another facility for adult male sex offenders, is smaller, with 15,407 inmates. Of that population, 62 percent are black. How does the racial makeup of the state’s prison population compare with the state’s overall population? According to the U.S. Census Bureau, 13.7 percent of New Jersey’s population is black. So Booker’s numbers are right. But we wondered how New Jersey compares with the rest of the nation. Based on estimates from the U.S. Bureau of Justice Statistics, the statistical arm of the U.S. Department of Justice, nearly 38 percent of prisoners under state and federal jurisdiction at the end of 2010 were black. According to the same data, about 32 percent of prisoners were white and more than 22 percent were Hispanic. The Bureau of Justice Statistics estimates are based on prisoners with a sentence of more than one year. Overall, 12.6 percent of the U.S. population is black, according to 2010 census data. John M. Paitakes, professor of criminal justice at Seton Hall University, said there are many factors behind these statistics, citing prior records and legal representation. He also noted that profiling and prejudice could be factors, but said, "I don’t think it’s any more in New Jersey than in other areas." "I think before you draw any conclusions you have to look at all those factors to get a realistic picture of what it is," he said. Our ruling Booker said New Jersey’s prison system is "61 percent African-American even though our state is just 13 percent black."

pomt-00488	Says Mahlon Mitchell "received a massive raise on the backs of hard-working firefighters and turned the union into his own personal political slush fund."	half-true	/wisconsin/statements/2018/aug/09/republican-party-wisconsin/wisconsin-gop-takes-jabs-democratic-gubernatorial-/	As eight Democrats fight for the right to take on Gov. Scott Walker in November, the state Republican Party is throwing its own punches from the sidelines. Their latest jab came in the form of an Aug. 1, 2018, news release announcing a series of radio ads against four Democrats running for governor. The ads pick up some of the same themes found on a party-created webpage that slams the "Democrats’ dangerous race to the left." Here’s what the GOP has to say about Mahlon Mitchell, head of the statewide firefighters union: "Mitchell received a massive raise on the backs of hard-working firefighters and turned the union into his own personal political slush fund." So, it’s a double shot. Let’s look at both parts of the claim -- the "massive raise" and the "personal political slush fund." Compensation increase When asked for evidence to back up this part of the statement, state GOP communications director Alec Zimmerman referred PolitiFact Wisconsin to a Jan. 22, 2018, piece by watchdog columnist Dan Bice in the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel. The online headline: "Firefighter leader Mahlon Mitchell would take pay cut if elected governor." The piece noted that Mitchell was named president of the state firefighters group early in 2011 in the wake of a scandal in which top union officials were filing fraudulent expense reports. Specifically, Zimmerman cited this paragraph: Since taking the union's helm, Mitchell has seen his pay jump from $54,500 in 2011 to $90,600 in 2016 (plus another $6,787 in other income) — a 66% bump, according to federal Department of Labor filings. His predecessor made about half what Mitchell does. PolitiFact Wisconsin checked the firefighter union’s Department of Labor filings for 2017 and found there had been another increase. Those filings show Mitchell’s 2017 union compensation at $70,922, plus $31,727 for disbursements for official business and an additional $12,431 for other disbursements for a total of $115,080. So, Mitchell’s overall union compensation went from $97,387 in 2016 to $115,080 in 2017, an increase of about 18 percent. When compared to $54,500 when he began in 2011, his union compensation has increased to $115,080 in 2017, or about 111 percent over six years. While there is no official definition for a "massive pay raise," Mitchell’s union compensation increase of 111 percent from 2011 to 2017 compares to an 18.3 percent increase in base pay for an entry level Madison firefighter during that same period. According to the City of Madison Fire Department website, an entry level firefighter is currently paid $50,204.70. In 2011, an entry level firefighter salary was $42,449.16. "Since he’s working at a Union funded by the dues of firefighters, it’s accurate to say that his raises were funded by their contributions," said Zimmerman. Still, framing it as on the "backs of hard-working firefighters" goes a little too far in that it portrays it as something imposed on union members. Steve Wilding, secretary/treasurer of the state firefighters union, told the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel in January 2018 that salaries and per-diems for the union's brass are voted on by the nearly 200 delegates at the group's annual convention. (Note: Mitchell’s pay from the City of Madison is not included in this discussion because the state GOP allegations are specifically addressing compensation from "hard-working firefighters" not city taxpayers.) Political spending On the "political slush fund" part of the claim, Zimmerman provided spreadsheets that showed, in his words, that the union’s political spending under Mitchell shifted to "being overwhelmingly supportive of liberal causes while he was at the helm, including over $40,000 to Mahlon’s campaigns." We turned to Follow The Money, a website that is part of the National Institute on Money in Politics, which compiles campaign-donor, lobbyist, and other information from government agencies nationwide. The site shows that the Wisconsin Professional Fire Fighters of Wisconsin has made an overwhelming majority of its contributions to Democratic candidates over the years, including Gov. Jim Doyle, Mary P. Burke and yes, Mahlon Mitchell, who in 2012 unsuccessfully ran for the office of lieutenant governor in a recall election against Rebecca Kleefisch. The union has also contributed to GOP candidates, such as Scott Walker and Brad Schimel, though the amount of the donations to the Republican candidates have fallen far short of the donations to Democrats. According to the Journal Sentinel January article, since 2011 to that point, the firefighter union's political action fund had donated a total of $129,250 to state candidates and PACs, with 98% of the cash going to Democrats. Also, during Mitchell's 2012 lieutenant governor's bid, the firefighters PAC gave $3,500 to his campaign and the union itself donated $40,000 to an outside group backing Mitchell with independent expenditures, the Journal Sentinel reported in the January article. Mitchell had no role, officials said, in the spending of these union funds, having recused himself on the matter. In the current campaign, a U.S. Department of Labor website listing shows the union contributed $25,000 to Mahlon Mitchell for Wisconsin on Nov. 13, 2017, and $15,444 on Nov. 30, 2017, for a total of $40,444. But what of the "slush fund" characterisation? The Merriam-Webster dictionary defines "slush fund" as "a fund for bribing public officials or carrying on corruptive propaganda; an unregulated fund often used for illicit purposes." While there is plenty of hyperbole in politics, in our view this goes too far. For instance, there are no allegations that contribution limits were ignored or any campaign finance laws broken. What’s more, there is no evidence that Mitchell alone decides where the union contributions go. In January, when the state GOP first made the "slush fund" allegation, Wilding -- the union secretary/treasurer -- told the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel that the union’s bylaws and constitution prevent individuals from enriching themselves at the expense of other members. In an Aug. 8 Journal Sentinel article, Wilding noted to columnist Dan Bice that Mitchell’s base compensation dropped from some $90,000 in 2016 to $70,000 in 2017. Wilding said top union officials are paid a small salary and a payment for services performed for the organization on a day-by-day basis. Meanwhile, Mitchell’s campaign communications director Kirsten Allen responded with a general slam on Walker. Allen did not provide a response when asked in a series of emails and telephone calls to address the specific issues that are part of this factcheck. Our rating The state GOP says Mitchell "received a massive raise on the backs of hard-working firefighters and turned the union into his own personal political slush fund." The union members did OK the compensation increase, so saying it was "on the backs" of firefighters goes too far. But Mitchell’s 111 percent increase over a period of about six years is a major one. So the GOP has a point on that part of the claim. Meanwhile, the union’s political contributions have shifted to Democrats, including more than $40,000 to Mitchell’s current campaign. But the GOP provided no evidence Mitchell solely decides where the political contributions go. Indeed, the union says he recuses himself from any discussions. Even with an allowance for the hyperbole of campaign season, the "slush fund" characterization goes too far.

pomt-02955	For the state of Florida, "there is not an additional cost with implementation of the Common Core standards."	half-true	/florida/statements/2013/oct/26/pam-stewart/state-education-chief-says-theres-no-additional-co/	One of the many complaints about Florida’s move toward new school standards has centered on its cost. "Based on data from several sources, the Common Core standards and accompanying tests will be very expensive – both to implement and to maintain," the Florida Stop Common Core Coalition argues on its website. At a recent public hearing on the standards, Florida education commissioner Pam Stewart challenged the criticism of the K-12 English and math standards. "Our analysis is there is not an additional cost with implementation of the Common Core standards," Stewart said. Her assertion brought out the doubters, even among Common Core supporters. PolitiFact Florida decided to take a closer look. The issue isn’t as clear cut as you might imagine. Most policy analysts watching Common Core agree that its implementation carries expenses. The National Conference of State Legislatures offers a sample list of what to expect: one-time transition costs such as new instructional materials, tests, technology and teacher training, and ongoing maintenance and updates. "When taking into account all of the things that need to be updated and the fact that it’s difficult for state education agencies to change their practice (move away from ‘business as usual’), I think it will be extremely challenging to keep costs flat," said Anne Hyslop, an education analyst for the New America Foundation. Indeed, the Florida Department of Education created a spreadsheet in February detailing more than $100 million in Common Core projects the state had embarked upon. The items included $24 million for the creation of student tutorial lessons, $4.7 million to generate math assessments and lesson study toolkits, and $25.5 million for a database of test questions for teachers to use. Funding for the vast majority of these projects came from a federal Race to the Top grant that Florida won, in part, for agreeing to adopt the Common Core. During the spring 2013 legislative session, Florida lawmakers noted that testing for the new standards would require computers, and they adopted a law barring the state from using Common Core-affiliated tests until all schools had the needed technology in place. The bill analysis noted that the State Board of Education requested $442 million for the improvements, a number later revised downward to $100 million. So the Common Core price tag is well documented. But that doesn’t make Stewart completely wrong. "It costs something," said Patrick Murphy, research director for the Public Policy Institute of California. "The question is, does it cost extra money than we were going to spend?" Murphy noted Stewart’s use of the word "additional," and said that makes all the difference. "It is not impossible to conceive of a scenario where existing funds that may have been slated for, say, ‘general’ professional development will be used to focus on the (Common Core). If I was running a school district, that is what I would do," he said. In a paper for the Thomas B. Fordham Institute titled "Putting a Price Tag on the Common Core," Murphy and colleagues put forth three models under which states might implement Common Core -- "Bare Bones," "Business as Usual" and "Balanced." In two of the three possibilities, the group projected Florida to carry millions in added costs. Florida Department of Education officials did not have any reports that separated costs out in such a way. State officials noted, though, that adoption of the standards cost nothing, and that much of the implementation, such as training and textbook purchases, would have been funded in some form even if the state weren’t using the standards. "The purchase of materials for the new standards was embedded in our regular instructional materials purchase cycle so did not result in additional purchases or increased costs unless school districts chose to do so," DOE spokeswoman Tiffany Cowie said in an email. As another example, the state’s move to improve school technology could be attributed to a 2011 legislative mandate to have materials fully digital by 2015, or an even earlier press to transition all state testing to computers. "This process began before Florida’s standards were adopted and will continue regardless of Florida’s new standards," Cowie said. Also, Florida has paid about $30.59 per student annually for FCAT testing in recent years. It has not selected a Common Core test, so it has no estimate for the potential cost differences. "If the department chooses PARCC, no additional cost will be incurred, as the creation of the test is free to all participating PARCC states," Cowie said. "If another test is selected, there will be costs associated with the procurement of a new test." From the department’s view, then, much of the money would have been spent on similar projects anyway, with or without the new standards. Our ruling Stewart said implementation of the Common Core would not incur additional expenses. Some of the money spent on Common Core is money the state would have spent anyway on curriculum and testing. But experts said it’s unlikely that implementing the new standards cost the state no additional money. Another wrinkle: The state received a federal grant to help pay for Common Core implementation.

pomt-10231	Barack Obama supports plans to raise "income taxes ... payroll taxes."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/sep/03/sarah-palin/obamas-taxes-hit-only-higher-incomes/	Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin accepted the nomination for the vice presidency at the Republican National Convention and used her speech to attack Democratic presidential nominee Barack Obama. "Taxes are too high. He wants to raise them. His tax increases are the fine print in his economic plan, and let me be specific," Palin said on Sept. 3, 2008, in St. Paul, Minn. "The Democratic nominee for president supports plans to raise income taxes ... raise payroll taxes ... raise investment income taxes ... raise the death tax ... raise business taxes ... and increase the tax burden on the American people by hundreds of billions of dollars." Here, we'll review Obama's position on income taxes and payroll taxes. We've checked previous claims about his position on investment income taxes and estate taxes . Obama wants to roll back the Bush tax cuts on the upper-income brackets. So the claim is true if you are a family making more than $250,000 a year, or a single person making more than $200,000. Otherwise, it's generally not the case. In fact, Obama advocates eliminating income taxes for seniors with incomes less than $50,000. The payroll tax claim is a little different. Obama proposes a $1,000 tax credit on income for working families ($500 for singles), to offset payroll taxes. So for most people, Obama is actually lowering payroll taxes. But he has said he would raise payroll taxes on people making higher incomes of about $250,000 in order to keep Social Security solvent. Currently, only the first $97,500 of a person's income is taxable. So for higher incomes, Obama would raise payroll taxes. Palin is painting Obama's proposals with a broad brush and not including crucial context. Obama does intend to increase taxes. But most people have incomes of less than $200,000, and these people would not see income tax increases or payroll tax increases under Obama's plan. We rate Palin's statement Half True.

"The focus of this body will be the economy and to help the private sector create jobs," Rep. Matt Huffman, the majority floor leader, said at a news conference at the Statehouse to roll out this year’s party agenda. House Republicans proclaimed the same message last year after they reclaimed the majority in the 2010 fall election. But state Rep. Armond Budish, the minority leader in the house, would beg to differ. He asserts that House Republicans instead pushed an agenda to diminish workers’ rights, voting rights and abortion rights. "We've seen more anti-women's choice bills introduced in the first half of this session than we've seen in the last three General Assemblies," Budish said at a Jan. 31 news conference announcing his party's priorities. PolitiFact Ohio asked Budish's office for the numbers. They provided a list identifying legislation that would restrict abortion that was introduced last year and from previous General Assemblies. We checked that list ourselves, too, using the search engine for laws, acts and legislation on the legislature's website. The list, we noted, includes such measures as HB 125, prohibiting abortion as soon as a fetal heartbeat is detected, and HB 153, the state operating budget, which contained two provisions restricting access to abortion. It did not include such measures as HB 180, creating the "Massillon Tiger Football Booster Club" license plate and prohibiting any money raised by it to go to "abortion-related activities." The list showed 11 bills that would affect abortion rights from 2011, the first session of the 129th General Assembly. That’s more than any of the three previous two-year sessions. There were eight bills in 128th General Assembly, nine in the 127th and six in the 126th. We rate Budish's statement as True.	None	Armond Budish	None	None	None	2012-02-03T06:00:00	2012-01-31	['None']
pomt-09577	"Because of the steps we took, there are about 2 million Americans working right now who would otherwise be unemployed."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/jan/27/barack-obama/obama-claims-two-million-more-americans-would-be-u/	The number of jobs "saved or created" by the massive economic stimulus championed by President Barack Obama has been a matter of intense partisan disagreement all year, and no doubt the president's claims in his State of the Union address will reignite the debate. "Because of the steps we took" in the stimulus, Obama said, "there are about 2 million Americans working right now who would otherwise be unemployed." Obama's numbers come from a Jan. 13, 2010, report from the White House Council of Economic Advisers, which concluded that through the fourth quarter of 2009, the stimulus raised employment relative to what it otherwise would have been by 1.5 million to 2 million jobs. So right off the bat, the president has chosen to highlight the top end of his own advisers' projection. And it is a projection, as the CEA report acknowledges, subject to a large margin of error. "As we have emphasized, measuring what a policy action has contributed to growth and employment is inherently difficult because we do not observe what would have occurred without the policy," the report states. "Therefore, it must be understood that our estimates are subject to substantial margins of error. The results, however, are strong enough and clear enough that we are confident that the basic conclusions are solid. That a wide range of private and government analysts concur with our estimates adds a reassuring check on our analysis." Let's taker a look at some of those other private and government analyses. The Congressional Budget Office, a nonpartisan government agency regularly cited by politicians in both parties, pegged the number of jobs saved or created by the stimulus through the fourth quarter of 2009 at somewhere between 800,000 and 2.4 million. That's obviously an extremely wide range, which the CBO said was "intended to reflect the uncertainty of such estimates and to encompass most economists’ views on the effects of fiscal stimulus." Obama's number is within that range, but well toward the high end. As an aside, the CBO recently revised its projection of the cost of the stimulus, estimating that it will cost $75 billion more than originally anticipated. The new estimate is that the stimulus will increase budget deficits by $862 billion over the next decade. The CEA report notes projections from several other economic forecasters: IHS/Global Impact, which projected the number jobs saved or created by the stimulus in 2009 at 1.25 million; Macroeconomic Advisers, 1 million; and Moody's Economy.com, 1.6 million. Obama's 2 million number is rosier than all of those projections. Many Republicans have attacked the "saved or created" numbers cited by the White House as ridiculous in light of an unemployment rate hovering around 10 percent; and the loss of roughly 3 million more jobs since the stimulus was passed. "There is absolutely no evidence whatsoever that the stimulus has saved or created any jobs, let alone 2 million," said Brian Riedl, lead budget analyst for the conservative Heritage Foundation. "It's impossible to know how the economy would have performed without the stimulus," Riedl said, and he finds it "implausible" that the country would have lost 5 million jobs in 2009 (the 3 million lost plus 2 million "saved" by the stimulus) if the stimulus had not passed. "I don't know how they can back that up." It's a classic case of single-entry bookkeeping, Riedl said. The government is just shifting jobs from one part of the economy to another, he said. The $250 billion spent by the federal government surely created jobs, he said, but fails to account for pulling $250 billion borrowed by the federal government from other sectors of the economy. "That's money that would have been spent somewhere else in the economy," Riedl said. "The effect is that you are going to cancel stuff out. That's why unemployment numbers aren't dropping." For the president's numbers to be true, Riedl said, you'd have to assume those who lent the federal government the money would otherwise have stuffed that $250 billion "in a mattress or put it in a safe." However, Gus Faucher, director of macroeconomics at Moody's Economy.com, said while Riedl's argument might hold water in robust economic times, the fact is that when the government passed the stimulus, "People weren't borrowing; the demand wasn't there." The last Moody's projection was for the third quarter of last year, he said, and at that point, Moody's estimated that employment was about 1.1 million greater than it would have been without the stimulus. Faucher expects that when fourth quarter numbers are added, that number will be closer to 1.5 million. "I would say that he (Obama) is in the ballpark," Faucher said. "It may be a little high, but not ridiculously high." But, he warned, these numbers are all just economic projections. "By definition, this is an art, not a science," Faucher said. And that's our biggest issue with Obama's definitive claim that if not for the stimulus, 2 million Americans working right now would otherwise be unemployed. It's a projection. Economists can't say for sure what would have happened if the stimulus had not passed, and whether those who got jobs through the stimulus would otherwise be unemployed. And while the number cited by Obama is backed up by the projections from his Council of Economic Advisers, it's on the high side of the projections from the CBO, and significantly higher than projections from several other economic forecasters. And so we rate Obama's claim Half True.	None	Barack Obama	None	None	None	2010-01-27T22:06:55	2010-01-27	['United_States']
pomt-13176	Says Democratic U.S. Senate candidate Russ Feingold "voted over 250 times to raise taxes."	false	/wisconsin/statements/2016/oct/27/americans-prosperity/americans-prosperity-falsely-claims-250-tax-increa/	Democrat Russ Feingold spent nearly two decades in the U.S. Senate, and is now trying to win back his old seat from Republican Ron Johnson, who ousted Feingold in 2010. A recent campaign ad from Americans for Prosperity claims one theme permeated Feingold’s tenure in Washington — a push for higher taxes. The conservative political advocacy group even puts a precise number on that claim: "He voted time and again to make life more expensive for families in Wisconsin," the narrator says in the ad, released in August. "Russ voted over 250 times to raise taxes — 250." The Club for Growth, another conservative group, used the same figure in an ad released Oct. 12, 2016, wording it as "250 votes for higher taxes." Did Feingold really cast that many votes to raise taxes? The matter isn’t as straightforward as the nice round number leads viewers to believe. Disagreement over budget votes When asked for backup, Americans for Prosperity, founded by billionaire businessman and activist David Koch, provided a list of 264 votes dating back to Feingold’s 1993 debut in the U.S. Senate. We did our own research and also sent the list to Feingold’s campaign for feedback. The foundational question is what constitutes a vote to "raise taxes"? More than half the votes cited in the ad — 150 — came on budget resolutions, which set non-binding parameters for considering tax and spending legislation. They are used as blueprints for the budget or in some cases to make a political statement. But PolitiFact has noted repeatedly that it is inaccurate to suggest votes on non-binding budget resolutions are the same as votes on legislation that sets policy. The resolutions often don’t include precise details and don’t on their own raise, lower or even keep taxes the same. "You’re voting for kind of an overall map and taking multiple votes on that same map, and not directly raising or lowering taxes in a piece of legislation," said Joshua Gordon, policy director of the Concord Coalition, a group that urges deficit reduction. Americans for Prosperity contends the votes are a fair addition to the tally. "Although many of the spending and revenue levels set in budget resolutions require additional legislative action to implement, there are a number of spending and tax policies set by budget resolutions," said James Fellinger, a spokesman for the group. "Budget resolutions enact procedural changes in order to ease the passage of those policies — voting for a budget resolution is plainly supporting the policies it outlines." The ad’s tally also includes many votes that were actually against tax cuts — not in favor of tax increases. Feingold spokesman Michael Tyler said Feingold campaign counted more than 150 such examples among the votes cited by Americans for Prosperity. It’s not merely a semantic distinction. When PolitiFact Florida fact-checked a nearly identical claim about votes to raise taxes, three federal budget experts generally agreed that a vote against a new tax cut isn’t the same as a vote for a tax increase. Gordon said that element of the ad’s claim "is probably the worst argument of all of them" from a fiscal policy perspective. "The voter reading that is going to believe (Feingold) voted in 250 separate times to raise an individual’s own income tax," Gordon said. "By any standard that sort of accounting is false in terms of what we expect the average voter to take away from the (claim)." A counting question Meanwhile, there is another problem: Though Americans for Prosperity cited 264 separate votes from Feingold, they came on only 65 pieces of legislation. The votes came on amendments that varied widely in content and scope, so each represented a different position. Nevertheless, that counting approach inflates the total. For example, Feingold cast 34 votes on Senate Concurrent Resolution 23 in 2003, which established Congress’ version of the budget for the following year. Each vote took a position on a proposed change of some kind, but should that count as 34 votes or one? "Counting multiple votes on the same legislation and all of its permutations just serves to pad the number, but in some cases isn’t completely inaccurate, just not telling the full tale," Steve Ellis, vice president of Taxpayers for Common Sense, told PolitiFact Florida in 2012 when it tackled and rated a similar item. Another problem with the 250 tally: some of the votes come on nuanced, multi-part amendments that are not easily categorized. One example is the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010, companion legislation to the Affordable Care Act that helped established Obamacare. Feingold cast three votes on March 24, 2010, against amendments that would exempt certain devices from a 2.3 percent tax (in effect, voting to raise a tax). But the amendment would have offset that by lowering the law’s affordability tax exemption for individuals (voting to lower a tax). Despite the offsetting effect, Americans for Prosperity lists it as a tax increase. Our rating Americans for Prosperity says Feingold voted more than 250 times to raise taxes as a U.S. senator, contending any vote in support of a higher tax should be part of that tally. But that number is built on assumptions and simplifications. Though Feingold cast tax-related votes that many times, more than half of those came on non-binding resolutions that took a position in favor of raising taxes but did not raise taxes by themselves. The claim also does not account for the large number of votes that were actually against a tax cut, not in favor of a tax increase. Experts say that’s a big difference. And it doesn’t acknowledge the nuanced nature of the votes themselves or that many votes came on elements of the same legislation. We rate the ad’s claim False. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/8aecd592-a350-4255-97a3-e1210795a4a1	None	Americans for Prosperity	None	None	None	2016-10-27T05:00:00	2016-08-22	['Russ_Feingold']
pomt-10123	"The Democrats in the Senate and some members of Congress defended what Fannie and Freddie were doing. They resisted any change."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/oct/13/john-mccain/theres-plenty-of-bipartisan-blame-for-crisis/	In the back-and-forth campaign blame game going on over the financial crisis, Sen. John McCain pointed the finger at Democrats and Obama for failing to support a plan to exert regulatory control over Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac in 2005 and 2006. "But you know, one of the real catalysts, really the match that lit this fire was Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac," McCain said at the second presidential debate on Oct. 7. "I'll bet you, you may never even have heard of them before this crisis. But you know, they're the ones that, with the encouragement of Senator Obama and his cronies and his friends in Washington, that went out and made all these risky loans, gave them to people that could never afford to pay back. "And you know, there were some of us that stood up two years ago and said we've got to enact legislation to fix this. We've got to stop this greed and excess. "Meanwhile," McCain said, "the Democrats in the Senate and some ? and some members of Congress defended what Fannie and Freddie were doing. They resisted any change." Set up decades ago by the federal government to underwrite mortgages and promote home ownership, Fannie Mae (the Federal National Mortgage Association) and Freddie Mac (the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp.) became major players in the domestic mortgage market. They don't make loans to homeowners directly, but they purchase mortgages, bundle them into securities, and sell some of them on the open market. Together, Fannie and Freddie owned or guaranteed about $5-trillion in mortgages, about half of the U.S. market. After years of rapid growth in home prices, foreclosures and mortgage delinquencies began rising by 2006. Some homeowners had adjustable-rate mortgages that were resetting to higher rates they could no longer afford. In other cases, speculators were overextended and dumping properties. Outright fraud had some role: people who took out loans never intending to pay them back. Regardless of the reasons, by 2008 foreclosures were affecting Fannie and Freddie. The agencies didn't have enough money to meet their financial obligations, and the U.S. government took them over on Sept. 7. When McCain points an accusing finger at the Democrats for encouraging Fannie and Freddie to make too many risky loans, he's talking about the Federal Housing Enterprise Regulatory Reform Act initiated by Republican Sen. Chuck Hagel in 2005. In 2006, McCain signed on to the Republican-led attempt at regulatory overhaul of the mortgage-financing firms, which both went through multibillion-dollar accounting scandals earlier in the decade. The occasion that prompted McCain’s involvement was the release of a 340-page report from the Office of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight that concluded that Fannie Mae had manipulated earnings and violated basic accounting principles. It describes an “arrogant and unethical corporate culture” in which executives were more concerned about their bonuses than meeting the company’s housing mission. The findings, based on a 27-month investigation and resulting in a $400-million fine paid to the government, prompted McCain to join other critics and call for more scrutiny of Fannie and its sibling, Freddie Mac."If Congress does not act, American taxpayers will continue to be exposed to the enormous risk that Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac pose to the housing market, the overall financial system, and the economy as a whole," McCain declared in a May 26, 2006, news release. While McCain is quick to blame Democrats for opposing the legislation — they did — the Republicans controlled Congress at the time, and there was a Republican in the White House. Yet the bill languished in the Senate, and it wasn't until earlier this year that Congress and the Bush administration, shaken by the extent of the subprime crisis, completed a regulatory overhaul by combining OFHEO and the Federal Housing Finance Board into a new regulatory body, the Federal Housing Finance Agency. We should also note that prior to 2000, support for Fannie and Freddie was more bipartisan. In the late 1990s, the Republican-controlled Congress — with the blessing of Democratic President Bill Clinton — eased the credit requirements on loans that Fannie and Freddie purchased. "It's a bipartisan problem," said Bill Beach, director of the Center for Data Analysis at the conservative Heritage Foundation. McCain rightly notes that the 2005-2006 efforts to regulate Fannie and Freddie were Republican-led, and opposed by the Democrats, but McCain's current attempts to depict those efforts as an early warning that could have lessened the current credit crisis don't wash. McCain was talking mostly about potential fallout from accounting troubles, not freewheeling lending standards based on a housing bubble. And he said nothing about major financial institutions becoming badly leveraged on bad loans and new securities products. Even if the 2006 effort to strengthen oversight had succeeded, it’s debatable whether it would have averted the subprime crisis. The extent of the problems was not yet fully known, and it’s a leap of faith to suggest that regulators granted expanded power would have noticed a deterioration in Fannie and Freddie’s loan portfolios soon enough and would have sounded an alarm. So first, when McCain talks about this legislation, it's not the cure-all he suggests it may have been; the focus then was on corruption in Fannie and Freddie, which isn't really what the financial crisis is about. Democrats may have opposed it, but it didn't appear to have all that many champions in a Republican-controlled Senate, either. And last, if you look back in time, Democrats and Republicans supported an easing of lending standards in the late 1990s. So for McCain to lay Fannie and Freddie woes entirely at the feet of the Democrats is unfair. We rate his statement Half True.

pomt-14145	"In the history of Republican primaries, I’ve gotten the most votes in the history of the Republican party."	false	/california/statements/2016/may/02/donald-trump/donald-trumps-claim-about-receiving-most-votes-eve/	Donald Trump’s march to the GOP nomination picked up steam last week, with dominant primary victories in the northeast. After the wins, several news outlets reported that the New York billionaire could break the record for most Republican primary votes in history — if Trump scores big in Indiana, New Jersey and California. Those states have yet to vote. Trump, apparently not wanting to wait, declared he’s already achieved the voting record. "In the history of Republican primaries, I’ve gotten the most votes in the history of the Republican party," Trump said during his speech on Friday, April 29 at the California Republican Party Convention south of San Francisco. Trump went on to say he’s broken the record without needing to wait for big states like California. Was Trump right? Had he already collected the most primary votes in history? We set out on a fact check. Our research Eric Ostermeier, a political science professor at the University of Minnesota and founder of the number-crunching blog Smart Politics, has taken a look at the data. "He is on pace to break the record, but he hasn’t yet," Ostermeier told PolitiFact California. "I’ve seen no possible configuration of numbers that show he’s already broken it." Ostermeier placed Trump’s primary vote total at about 10 million so far. That’s still short of the 10.8 million votes George W. Bush received in the 2000 GOP primaries. If one counts both primaries and caucuses, Trump would still be short of Bush’s overall tally, the professor said. Bush’s total is considered closer to 12 million if both types of elections are counted, he said. Ostermeier estimated Trump would likely achieve the primary vote record if he earns a strong win in California’s primary, where he could pick up more than a million additional primary votes. He said Trump’s large vote totals can be attributed to the relatively close match-up he’s had with Cruz late into the primary season. Several news articles, including by the Washington Post and Politico, used primary vote totals logged by RealClearPolitics.com. Its data show Trump has yet to break the record. Trump’s campaign did not respond to our request for comment. Our ruling Donald Trump said he’s already earned the most Republican primary votes in history. Experts who track this say Trump is on pace to break the record, but is still shy by about 800,000 votes. They predicted a strong victory in California --- more than a month from now -- could hand Trump the milestone. We rate Trump’s claim False … for now. UPDATE: About one month after PolitiFact California rated Donald Trump’s "most votes in history" claim on April 29, 2016 as "False … for now," the vote totals have changed. Trump now appears to have broken the all-time record for most votes in a GOP presidential primary. That’s according to Eric Ostermeier, a political science professor at the University of Minnesota and founder of the number-crunching blog Smart Politics. Ostermeier told us on June 1, 2016 that Trump’s victory in the Washington primary on May 24, 2016 put him over the top. The rating on his April 29 claim remains the same because we judge statements based on the data available at the time. Trump got ahead of himself again during a speech in Sacramento, also on June 1, 2016, where he said he’s broken the GOP presidential primary record "by millions" of votes. We rated that claim "False again … for now." Ostermeier predicted Trump could smash the record by millions following the June 7 primary in California, New Jersey and other states.

pomt-14768	"If Trump had just put his father’s money in a mutual fund ... he’d have $8 billion."	false	/punditfact/statements/2015/dec/09/occupy-democrats/occupy-democrats-say-simple-investment-trumps-fath/	Donald Trump is a billionaire and he plays it up big in his bid to be president. What he did in business, he argues, he can do for the country. Republican and Democratic critics aim to shoot holes in that assumption. One tack is that Trump hasn’t been the super savvy investor he purports to be. The liberal group Occupy Democrats posted an image on its Facebook page on Dec. 2, 2015, to bring Trump down a notch or 10. Under a smiling photo of Trump, the image has these words: "Bloomberg puts Trump’s current net worth at $2.9 billion. ... If Trump had just put his father’s money in a mutual fund that tracked the S&P 500 and spent his career finger-painting, he’d have $8 billion." The source, included in the post, is Deborah Friedell with the London Review of Books. As it turns out, the graphic from Occupy Democrats did a fine job of quoting Friedell, but Friedell did a less than stellar job of quoting the source for her claim. Friedell’s words come from her review of a new biography of Donald Trump, Never Enough: Donald Trump and the Pursuit of Success by Michael D’Antonio. Here’s the full text relevant to this fact-check: "Bloomberg puts Trump’s current net worth at $2.9 billion, Forbes at $4.1 billion. The National Journal has worked out that if Trump had just put his father’s money in a mutual fund that tracked the S&P 500 and spent his career finger-painting, he’d have $8 billion." But if you read the National Journal story, it doesn’t directly tie whatever money Trump got from his father to an eventual $8 billion today. Here’s the key paragraph from a Sept. 2, 2015, article headlined "The 1 Easy Way Donald Trump Could Have Been Even Richer: Doing Nothing." "Had the celebrity busi­ness­man and Re­pub­lic­an pres­id­en­tial can­did­ate in­ves­ted his even­tu­al share of his fath­er’s real-es­tate com­pany in­to a mu­tu­al fund of S&P 500 stocks in 1974, it would be worth nearly $3 bil­lion today, thanks to the mar­ket’s per­form­ance over the past four dec­ades. If he’d in­ves­ted the $200 mil­lion that For­bes magazine de­term­ined he was worth in 1982 in­to that in­dex fund, it would have grown to more than $8 bil­lion today." There’s a bit of informed guesswork behind these numbers because outsiders can only know so much about Trump’s finances. The National Journal writer, S.V. Dáte, figured Trump started with $40 million in 1974. That’s the year he became president of his father’s real estate company. By one estimate, the firm was worth about $200 million and divided among Donald Trump and his four siblings, each would have received $40 million. But it’s not as though the company was liquidated that year. Trump’s father lived until 1999, so whatever happened, it’s more complicated than Trump receiving a cash inheritance in 1974 and deciding what he would do with it. We’re left with a question of how much money Trump got from his father and, most important, at what point those assets morphed from being his father’s to being his. In 1982, after running his father’s firm for eight years, Forbes magazine estimated Trump’s worth at $200 million. Since he was in charge of the company, then those dollars are more his than his father’s. The Journal article tiptoed around this uncertainty with careful phrasing. The author talked about Trump investing "his eventual share of his father’s real estate company." An eventual share is not cash in hand. Similarly, the article did not say that the estimated $200 million in 1982 was from Trump’s father. Dáte told us in his view, that truly was Trump's money because the real estate company was worth more than that. Dáte said he didn't really care what the status of the assets was. "I just wanted to get to the point of saying that given the amount of money he started with, to be a billionaire — it's not too hard," Dáte said. "I worded it as carefully as I did because there are a lot of uncertainties." Importantly, if the $200 million did not come from Trump's father, then you can't say that the father's money could have been worth $8 billion today. But the Occupy Democrats’ Facebook post took a paraphrase of the National Journal piece and then edited the paraphrase down to the text on the image. Occupy Democrats editor Omar Rivero didn’t defend the graphic he shared. Rivero said his group occasionally shares graphics made by others. "As you can see in the post description and in the watermark, this graphic was made by Santa Pegatina, a political graphics maker," Rivero said. The best summary of the National Journal article is that it presents a hypothetical investment scenario using numbers that have some basis in the value of the Trump holdings, but aren’t necessarily what Trump got directly from his father. Running the numbers Even if the underlying assumptions are dodgy, the math at least is in the ballpark. We used $40 million as the starting point for 1974. Honghui Chen, associate professor of finance at the University of Central Florida, told us the account would have grown to $3.94 billion by November 2015 if the money had followed the S&P 500 index and all dividends had been reinvested. This is a rough calculation that ignores taxes owed on dividends, but it’s on the same scale as what the National Journal reported. Chen said it’s trickier to calculate the value of $200 million invested in 1982. "Because the stock market in 1982 was quite volatile, the current value of $200 million investment in 1982 would depend on the time at which it was initially invested," Chen said. If it went in right at the end of 1981, it would be worth $6.7 billion. Invested in June 1982, the value today would be $8.3 billion. Invested at the end of 1982, it would be worth $9 billion. Again, in the neighborhood of what the Journal said. There is a huge debate over Trump’s current net worth. Estimates from outsiders, such as Bloomberg and Forbes, range from about $3 billion to about $4 billion. Trump says he has closer to $9 billion. Our ruling Occupy Democrats shared an image that said if Trump had taken the money he got from his father and simply put it in a fund that tracked the S&P 500, he’d have $8 billion today. While it's true that Trump got a leg up from his father on the order of many tens of millions of dollars, this specific claim suffers from a key flaw. The only way to hit the $8 billion mark is to start with $200 million in 1982, and it's wrong to say that was Trump's father's money. While the father's business put Trump on the path to have $200 million in 1982, Trump himself had been running the company for eight years. We rate this claim False.

pomt-07680	Says Florida Gov. Rick Scott’s cuts to education are the same as his proposed corporate income tax rate reduction.	mostly false	/florida/statements/2011/mar/08/alan-grayson/alan-grayson-returns-msnbc-stage-criticizes-gov-ri/	Minutes after Florida Gov. Rick Scott finished delivering his first State of the State address, a trio of Democrats took turns rebuffing the new governor on everything he just said. Senate Minority Leader Nan Rich and House Minority Leader Ron Saunders came first in brief televised remarks, attacking Scott’s plans to cut education funding and make teachers, firefighters and police officers take de facto pay cuts in order to contribute to their own retirement. They were, in many ways, a warm-up act for former Florida U.S. Rep. Alan Grayson, who used a national cable platform offered by MSNBC to excoriate Scott's plans. Grayson opened the interview on March 8, 2011, by answering a question about how Scott -- whose former hospital company Columbia/HCA pleaded guilty to 14 corporate felonies and paid $1.7 billion in fines -- could be elected governor in the first place. He said it was par for the course for Florida Republicans. "The last head of the Republican Party of Florida was literally led away in chains and indicted," Grayson said, referring to deposed RPOF chairman Jim Greer. Then Grayson cracked a joke, saying Scott once refused to answer questions during a deposition by invoking his 5th Amendment constitutional rights 75 times. "That’s like pleading the 375th." Grayson closed the interview by criticizing Scott’s plan to cut and eventually eliminate the state’s 5.5 percent corporate income tax, suggesting education spending reductions are funding the corporate tax cut. "He wants to eliminate the corporate income tax and cut corporate taxes in Florida by $1.5 billion," Grayson said. "He wants to cut funding for the schools by $1.5 billion. "He’s taking money out of children’s pockets dollar for dollar so he can stuff it in his own." We knew we’d find a fact check among all the one-liners. We wanted to see if Grayson’s shrewd ledger work is right: Does Scott’s budget reduce education funding by the same amount he would cut corporate taxes? The numbers are fairly easy to find, it turns out. Scott’s budget proposal for 2011-12 reduces the total amount of state K-12 education funding from $18.2 billion, to $16.5 billion -- a total cut of $1.7 billion. That number includes local property taxes the state mandates school boards collect (the required local effort), the state contribution from sales tax revenues and trust funds, and money passing through the state from the federal government. The cuts break down this way (we’re rounding a bit, so everything might not add up exactly): * The state’s contribution would decrease by about $11 million, but remain largely the same, about $8.9 billion. * Required local education taxes would shrink by about $660 million, and discretionary local taxes would shrink an additional $200 million -- shrinking the local contribution from about $8.4 billion to nearly $7.5 billion. * And the state also would not replace about $873 million in federal stimulus funds. On the other side of the ledger is Scott’s proposed cut to the 5.5 percent corporate income tax. The tax is exactly what it sounds like -- it’s paid as a percentage of the incomes of Florida businesses. Florida already has one of the lower corporate tax rates in the country, but Scott has made eliminating the tax a priority. As part of his 2011-12 budget, Scott proposes reducing the tax rate to 3 percent. His office says the reduction will save corporations $460 million. Put another way, the cut will trim state revenues as part of the 2011-12 budget by $460 million. It doesn’t take an Ivy League mathematics degree to figure out that the numbers don’t begin to line up the way Grayson suggests. The tax cuts represent $460 million, which is less than one third of the $1.7 billion education cut. Part of the issue might be Scott’s budget proposal is actually for two years -- 2011-12 and 2012-13. Over two years -- after factoring in a second reduction of the corporate income tax rate from 3 to 2.5 percent -- corporations would save a total of $1.5 billion, according to the governor’s office. But that’s not being fair -- $1.5 billion over two years doesn’t exactly compare to $1.7 billion over one year. In reviewing Scott’s tax-cutting proposals, it appears Grayson’s error also could have been singling out the corporate income tax as a way to cast Scott as a greedy CEO-type looking out only for his buddies. As we said in a previous item, Scott is proposing a total of $1.7 billion in tax and fee cuts as part of his 2011-12 budget. Scott’s proposal includes cuts to the corporate income tax, a cut to required school district property taxes, and a cut to unemployment taxes. PolitiFact Florida has previously ruled that roughly half of those cuts apply only to businesses, while half apply to homeowners and typical Floridians. Look at the numbers -- a total of $1.7 billion in tax and fee cuts in 2011-12 versus a proposed total education funding cut of $1.7 billion. They match (well, they’re not identical, because of rounding). And there’s one final way to look at this. The corporate income tax is estimated to collect about $2 billion in the current budget year. If it’s eliminated, a goal of Scott’s, that would be $2 billion less the state would receive. That’s on the order of the $1.7 billion K-12 education Scott is proposing for 2011-12. But again, that’s comparing additional budget years beyond even 2012-13 to cuts coming this year. On MSNBC, Grayson targeted Scott’s proposal to cut the corporate income tax, suggesting the cuts for corporate CEOs are being paid for on the back of students. While he’s right that any tax cut results in money not available to be spent on programs like education, he gets his numbers wrong. If Grayson had said the tax cuts and fees being proposed by Scott are being paid for by education cuts, he’d have more of a point. But sticking to what he said, we rate this claim Barely True.

pomt-10215	"While Sarah was Mayor of Wasilla she tried to fire our highly respected City Librarian because the Librarian refused to consider removing from the library some books that Sarah wanted removed."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/sep/09/chain-email/story-of-banned-books-is-murky/	One of the most potent claims in an e-mail written by Wasilla, Alaska, resident Anne Kilkenny is that when Sarah Palin was mayor, she tried to have some books removed from the city library. Here's how the claim reads in Kilkenny's e-mail: "While Sarah was Mayor of Wasilla she tried to fire our highly respected City Librarian because the Librarian refused to consider removing from the library some books that Sarah wanted removed. City residents rallied to the defense of the City Librarian and against Palin's attempt at out-and-out censorship, so Palin backed down and withdrew her termination letter." ( Read the entire e-mail for yourself here. ) The most definitive record for much of this issue comes from a Dec. 18, 1996, article in the Wasilla newspaper, the Frontiersman. In that story, Wasilla library director Mary Ellen Emmons (now Mary Ellen Baker) said that after Palin was elected mayor, she twice inquired about censoring library books. "I'm not trying to suppress anyone's views," Emmons told the Frontiersman. "But I told her (Palin) clearly, I will fight anyone who tries to dictate what books can go on the library shelves." "This is different than a normal book-selection procedure or a book-challenge policy," Emmons said. "She was asking me how I would deal with her saying a book can't be in the library." Palin told the Frontiersman that she had no particular books or other material in mind when she posed the questions to Emmons. In a written statement to the newspaper, Palin "said she was only trying to get acquainted with her staff" and that the question was "rhetorical." Also from the story: "Emmons said Palin asked her on Oct. 28 if she would object to censorship, even if people were circling the library in protest about a book. 'I told her it would definitely be a problem the ACLU would take on then,' Emmons said. "Asked who she thought might picket the library, Palin said Monday, 'Had no one in mind ... again, the issue was discussed in the context of a professional question being asked in regards to library policy.' " In an interview with PolitiFact, Kilkenny said the issue also came up at a council meeting soon after Palin took office in 1996. Time has passed, Kilkenny said, and she can't remember the exact words, but she said Palin asked Emmons something like, "What would your response be to my request to remove books from the library collection?" "I remember being shocked at the implication," Kilkenny said. She said that there was a long pause of silence, and that Emmons responded that books were selected in line with national criteria for a library its size. Kilkenny said she remembered Emmons concluded firmly: "I would absolutely not comply with your request." Kilkenny said Palin's request didn't sound rhetorical to her. The conversation between Palin and Emmons came the same week that Palin requested resignations from all the city department heads as a test of loyalty, the Frontiersman noted. Emmons, a popular librarian who was then president of the Alaska Library Association, did not resign. On Jan. 30, 1997, about six weeks after the story appeared, Palin told Emmons and the police chief that she was dismissing them. The next day, Palin changed her mind about Emmons and let her stay on. Emmons finally resigned in August 1999. ( See our ruling on the e-mail's claim about the police chief here. ) We can say for certain that no book was ever banned. Nor is there any record that Palin initiated a formal process to censor any books. June Pinell-Stephens, longtime chair of the Intellectual Freedom Committee of the Alaska Library Association, said she scoured the organization's archives and could find no record of any formal actions to ban books in Wasilla under Palin's tenure as mayor. That jibes with Wasilla Library records as well. "We have no records of any books being 'banned or censored' ever," Wasilla Mayor Diane M. Keller said in a statement released about the issue. Keller told PolitiFact that the city hasn't been able to find any minutes to substantiate that the issue was ever raised by Palin at a City Council meeting. Nor does Keller, who was a council member at the time, recall any such conversations. Jeanne Troshynski, president of the Friends of Wasilla Library, said the last formal request to remove a book came in 2005, with the challenge of a book written by Jon Stewart of The Daily Show called America (The Book): A Citizen's Guide to Democracy Inaction. That was three years after Palin left office as mayor. Wasilla records show the last formal challenge before that was in 1986 to Bumps in the Night, by Harvey Allard — well before Palin's tenure as mayor. In both cases, the challenges were denied and the books remained on the shelf. But Kilkenny's e-mail doesn't claim that Palin initiated a formal process to ban books. In fact, Kilkenny said she does not recall that Palin even mentioned specific books that she wanted banned. And Emmons, now Mary Ellen Baker, isn't talking. A message on her answering machine states: "I have nothing to add to reports from that time. I do not want to discuss the matter. Please respect my privacy." But the Frontiersman reporter who wrote that article in 1996 now says Emmons told him Palin did mention three books that she wanted removed from the shelves. Paul Stuart is semiretired, though he still occasionally contributes articles to a weekly paper, the Mountain Ear, in Conway, N.H., where he lives. Stuart told PolitiFact that in a conversation with Emmons after his article ran, she listed three titles. He said he could recall only two, and initially said they were I Told My Parents I'm Gay and I Asked My Sister. We looked for these titles; they don't appear to exist. "Mary Ellen told me that Palin asked her directly to remove these books from the shelves," Stuart said. "She refused." Asked later if the first book could have been Pastor, I am Gay, a controversial book written by a pastor who lives just outside Wasilla, Stuart said that was it. Howard Bess, author of Pastor, I am Gay and former pastor of Church of the Covenant in nearby Palmer, recalls that his book challenging Christians to re-examine their ideas about and prejudices against gays and lesbians was not well received in Wasilla when it was published in 1995 — the year before Palin was elected mayor. Virtually every book store in Wasilla refused to sell it. Bess said he gave two copies to the Wasilla Library, but they quickly disappeared. So he donated more copies. The controversy over the book was part of the context of that time period, he said. "Knowing Sarah's religious connections and the people involved, I would be surprised if my book was not one of those at issue," Bess said. "But I don't know that for a fact." "I don't think anyone has the facts except Mary Ellen, and she ain't talking," Bess said. In addition to Kilkenny's e-mail, there is another one circulating widely with the subject line, "The Books Sarah Palin tried to have banned." It purports to be a list taken from the official minutes of the Wasilla Library Board. ( Read it for yourself here. ) The 93 titles appear to be a generic list of frequently banned books. It was not part of the official minutes of the Wasilla Library Board. In fact, the Harry Potter series listed didn't even begin until 1998, two years after this list is alleged to have been generated. In short, the list is a fake. As for Kilkenny's claim, there is no proof that Palin tried to fire the librarian because she refused to consider removing books. In fact, Palin asked for the resignation of a handful of department heads to test their loyalty, according to reports at the time. The claim that Palin had specific books she wanted removed is also unsupported. Kilkenny herself said she does not recall that any titles were named by Palin at the time. Yes, a reporter provides a secondhand account 12 years later in which he says the librarian named books Palin wanted removed. But Stuart's recollection seems hazy (he didn't get the right title at first). The librarian isn't talking. There are no public records or meeting minutes to substantiate the claim. And no one else corroborates that Palin ever listed any titles. So we find no basis to find that part of the story true. But Palin did ask the librarian if she would consider removing books. Maybe it was posed as a rhetorical question as Palin says. But she asked. So we rule the statement Half True.	None	Chain email	None	None	None	2008-09-09T00:00:00	2008-08-31	['Wasilla,_Alaska']
pomt-10658	"McCain opposes repeal of the death tax."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2007/dec/31/mitt-romney/mccain-wants-to-keep-it-on-life-support/	Gov. Mitt Romney has a television ad in New Hampshire that attacks Sen. John McCain for his positions on taxes and illegal immigrants. Specifically, he charges that McCain "opposes repeal of the death tax," officially called the estate tax, a tax on the property passed forward and received at death. Just looking at the votes, Romney is right. The issue has come before the U.S. Senate at least three times, and each time McCain voted against permanently repealing the estate tax. But in a closer look at McCain's record, we find he supports a plan that would render the tax moot for most people. McCain says he wants a tax exemption on estates worth up to $10-million and a 15 percent tax on inheritances worth more than that. Under that plan, about 95 percent of the estate tax returns filed in 2006 would be exempt, according to Internal Revenue Service statistics. Which means the tax would survive for only the wealthiest few. Still, given McCain's votes against repealing the tax, we rule Romney's claim Mostly True.

pomt-07239	"In the late 1980s, the U.S. was nearly the lowest-taxed nation in the world, and a quarter century later we're nearly the highest."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/may/31/steve-moore/wall-street-journals-steve-moore-says-us-taxes-wer/	In a May 26, 2011, column in the Wall Street Journal, Stephen Moore, one of the editorial page editors, argued that the United States had low taxes compared to its rivals when Ronald Reagan was president, but now ranks among the world’s highest-taxed nations. "In the late 1980s," Moore wrote, "the U.S. was nearly the lowest taxed nation in the world, and a quarter century later we're nearly the highest." The claim came within a column that argued that proposals by President Barack Obama could effectively raise the marginal tax rate for the nation’s wealthiest taxpayers to 62 percent. We recently checked a similar claim by Rep. Paul Ryan, R-Wis., who said that Obama policies would lead to a top rate of 44.8 percent. (Ryan’s claim -- which earned a rating of Mostly True -- used less expansive parameters than Moore's did.) After a reader suggested that we look at the column, we zeroed in on Moore’s claim about comparative international taxes. We should start off by noting that most comparisons like these are not made with every nation in the world but rather with countries that belong to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, or OECD, a group of nearly three-dozen large, industrialized democracies. This makes it a fairer comparison. Because Moore was writing in the rest of the column about marginal personal income tax rates, we first turned to international comparisons of those rates for the OECD nations. We looked at data for 1988 -- Reagan’s last year in office, and a year when top U.S. marginal tax rates reached a new low -- as well as 2010. For 1988, the highest marginal tax rate for U.S. taxpayers was 28 percent. Of the 20 countries in the OECD comparison, only one had a lower rate -- Switzerland, at 11.5 percent. So using this statistic, Moore is correct. However, top marginal tax rates are an imperfect statistic for this kind of comparison. Perhaps the most important problem is that they only take into account national taxes. Some OECD nations levy relatively light taxes at the national level but heavy taxes at the state and local level. This makes international comparisons using only the national statistic incomplete. So we turned to another yardstick -- tax revenues as a percentage of gross domestic product. This measure shows how big the total tax burden is compared with a nation’s economy. It incorporates national, state and local taxes of all types, rather than just income taxes. OECD statistics are available for 1985, in a study of 26 nations. In the U.S., total tax revenue accounted for 25.6 percent of GDP. Only six nations had a lower percentage -- Mexico, Korea, Greece, Portugal, Switzerland and Turkey -- and several of those were not among the top ranks of industrialized nations in 1985. So here too, Moore’s has solid backing for his claim that in the 1980s "the U.S. was nearly the lowest-taxed nation in the world." But what about today? Here, the backing is less solid. Looking strictly at top marginal tax rates, the U.S. rate of 35 percent was solidly in the middle of the pack -- tied for 18th among the 34 nations studied. Moore’s claim doesn’t hold up any better if you use taxes as a percentage of GDP. In 2006 -- the most recent year for which an OECD comparison is available -- taxes accounted for 28 percent of U.S. GDP, up modestly from what it was in 1985. All told, 25 nations had a higher percentage than the U.S., while just four -- Mexico, Japan, Korea and Turkey -- had a lower percentage. That hardly makes the U.S. "nearly the highest" taxed nation in the world. In fact, in order to rank in the top five nations on the 2006 list, the U.S. would have needed taxes to account for 43 percent of GDP -- about one and a half times their actual share. When we asked Moore if there was any data we were missing that would prove his point about the U.S. tax burden today, he said, "today our corporate tax rate is highest and our personal income tax with the Obama proposals (included) would be well above average." He’s basically correct that our corporate tax rate is the world’s highest -- we’ve ruled that claim Mostly True in the past, although for many companies, loopholes and other tax rules bring down the rate they actually pay. Even so, nowhere in the column does Moore bring up corporate or business taxes, so we don’t think that’s strong support for his claim. As for potential tax increases under Obama, those are speculative. Because of that, we don’t see them as justification for stating that "a quarter century later we're nearly the highest" in taxation. Moore would have been on safer ground if he’d written, "If the increases I’ve outlined here are enacted, we might end up with some of the highest tax rates in the world." But even this would be speculative, since we wouldn’t know what other countries’ tax rates will be if and when the U.S. hikes Moore opposes are enacted. We have no quarrel with Moore’s characterization of the late 1980s as a period when U.S. taxes were low compared with its rivals. It clearly was. But Moore's main point, that taxes have gone up significantly since the late 1980s, is a stretch. To the contrary, we find convincing evidence that the U.S. today remains a relatively low-tax nation compared to its industrialized competitors. U.S. tax rates might go up over the next few years, but that's speculation, not established facts. On balance, we rate Moore's comment Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.

pomt-13273	"Lindsay Parkhurst wants to take away programs like Social Security and Medicare that seniors have earned throughout their lifetimes."	pants on fire!	/illinois/statements/2016/oct/13/katherine-cloonen/cloonen-says-her-gop-opponent-wants-strip-seniors/	Few local legislative races in Illinois are as hotly contested as the one in the 79th District between incumbent state Rep. Kate Cloonen, D-Kankakee, and her Republican challenger Lindsay Parkhurst. Cloonen, who won the 2014 election by a mere 122 votes and the 2012 election by just 91, is seeking her third term in the General Assembly. Parkhurst is a political newcomer and a defense attorney who has headed a general practice law firm for 16 years, during which she has represented clients in Social Security disability and workers’ compensation cases. In a Sept. 21 campaign ad posted on Cloonen’s Facebook page, she claimed, "Lindsay Parkhurst wants to take away programs like Social Security and Medicare that seniors have earned throughout their lifetimes." Since state lawmakers play no role in these federal programs, we decided to check the record to see if there’s any merit to Cloonen’s claim. Confusing claim Cloonen’s campaign did not respond to multiple emails and phone messages requesting information and sources used to back up her claim. The ad cites three articles from 2011 by the Philadelphia Tribune, NPR and Bloomberg.com, as well as a March 2014 article by the Chicago Tribune. However, the NPR article dated March 29, 2011, was about Democratic members of Congress holding a rally to support Social Security. The Bloomberg story from Aug. 12, 2011, was about former GOP congresswoman and presidential candidate Michele Bachmann calling for cuts to Social Security and Medicare for future recipients. Neither article mentions Parkhurst. A search of the Philadelphia Tribune and Chicago Tribune archives did not yield any results for the dates listed. But considering Parkhurst was a private citizen at the time and not even on the political radar, it’s unlikely these news stories would include any mention of her, let alone describe her position on Medicare and Social Security benefits for seniors. In a phone interview, Parkhurst told PolitiFact Illinois she has no idea where the Cloonen camp got this information to level the accusation. Parkhurst noted she has represented clients in cases involving Social Security disability benefits for people who were not at the eligible age of 65 -- the opposite of what Cloonen’s ad suggests. "I advocate for people to qualify and obtain those benefits," Parkhurst said. "I have been an advocate for 16 years." When asked about her general position on Social Security and Medicare, Parkhurst said both are part of a contract the federal government has made with U.S. citizens and one that must be honored, not eliminated. Regardless, the claim against Parkhurst is curious because state lawmakers have no authority over these federal programs. State role in Social Security and Medicare Charlie Wheeler, director of the Public Affairs Reporting graduate program at the University of Illinois-Springfield and a long-time former politics and government reporter for the Chicago Sun-Times, says the ad attempts to make a connection that’s not there and ignores the fact that the state only administers these programs and cannot eliminate Social Security benefits or Medicare for seniors. Wheeler said the only quasi-logical explanation behind Cloonen’s claim is that the Democrat is trying to tie Parkhurst to the GOP’s national platform, which many believe includes policies that would hurt the Social Security program. It’s a very old and common campaign tactic to link a local legislative candidate to his or her party’s broader policies and scandals, Wheeler noted, pointing to recent TV ads and campaign mailers in which Democratic and Republican candidates have tried linking their opponents to sex offenders. "The state Legislature and state law have very little to do with Social Security and Medicare. Those are federal programs," Wheeler said. "State involvement would be to the extent that it collects Social Security taxes and passes them on to the federal government." Our ruling In a campaign ad posted on Facebook, Cloonen said, "Lindsay Parkhurst wants to take away programs like Social Security and Medicare that seniors have earned throughout their lifetimes." With Social Security and Medicare being federal programs, state lawmakers have no say in setting benefit levels for these programs. Additionally, Parkhurst has not previously held elected office and therefore has no public voting record on Social Security or Medicare. Nor has she talked about her position on Medicare or Social Security benefits in her campaign. Ironically, Parkhurst is a defense attorney whose law firm has helped clients obtain Social Security disability benefits. She believes both Social Security and Medicare are part of a contract the federal government must honor. Cloonen’s campaign did not respond to multiple emails and messages for comment, and the articles cited in the ad contain no mention of Parkhurst. There is no evidence to back Cloonen’s claim, nor can we find any statement or action by Parkhurst that would have, even indirectly, elicited it. We rate Cloonen’s claim Pants on Fire. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/487f0897-a88a-4c8f-a8c5-4d5464447785	None	Katherine Cloonen	None	None	None	2016-10-13T14:12:31	2016-09-21	['Medicare_(United_States)']
pomt-07784	"The firefighters, the policemen and others who supported (Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker) in his election bid ... don't have to worry about their collective bargaining rights."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/feb/21/donna-brazile/donna-brazile-says-unions-supported-scott-walker-a/	The ongoing budget crisis in Wisconsin got pundits George Will and Donna Brazile debating on This Week with Christiane Amanpour. Will said that changes proposed by Gov. Scott Walker were reasonable and necessary given budget constraints. Brazile countered that the governor was using the excuse of a budget battle to destroy collective bargaining rights for public employee unions. "And, look, what we're talking about is that the governor has cherry-picked what public workers he will subject to this so-called removal of their collective bargaining rights," Brazile said. "The firefighters, the policemen and others who supported him in his election bid, well, guess what? They don't have to worry about their collective bargaining rights." Brazile implied that this was political payback, and we want to be clear that we’re not checking Walker’s motivations. We’re looking only at whether "the firefighters, the policemen and others who supported him in his election bid ... don't have to worry about their collective bargaining rights." Our first stop was checking Walker’s proposal. It asks state workers to pay more for their pensions and health insurance, which reduces take-home pay. But it also sets limits on collective bargaining power for the public sector unions. In a letter to public workers, Walker explained that his proposal would limit bargaining only to base pay, which means unions could not bargain for improved health insurance, working conditions or pension benefits. Pay increases would be limited to increases in the cost of living, using the Consumer Price Index, unless voters approved other pay increases via a referendum. Union members would have to vote to stay unionized each year, and contracts could only last only a year, among other limitations. Walker concluded the list of changes by noting, "Local police and fire employees and State Patrol Troopers and Inspectors are exempted from these changes." So Brazile is right that police, firefighters and others are exempt. Our next question was, are these the groups "who supported him in his election bid"? During the campaign last November, leaders of the Milwaukee Professional Firefighters Association and Milwaukee Police Association appeared in an ad supporting Walker and blasting his opponent, Democrat Tom Barrett. Walker also won endorsements from the West Allis Professional Police Association and the Wisconsin Troopers Association Walker didn’t get the endorsements of two statewide unions, the Wisconsin Professional Police Association and the Professional Fire Fighters of Wisconsin, which both backed Barrett. For the record, the governor told the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel that the charge that he was exempting police and firefighters was "ridiculous." He said he didn't recommend changing the rules for police officers and firefighters because he didn’t want public safety work disrupted. We then contacted the Wisconsin Professional Police Association, the statewide union that endorsed Walker's opponent last year. Executive director Jim Palmer said the statewide organization is much larger than the local Milwaukee police union that endorsed Walker. The state group has approximately 11,000 members versus Milwaukee’s roughly 1,400, he said. Similarly, the state firefighters association has more than 3,000, compared with the Milwaukee union’s 875. The state police union is opposed to the changes Walker is proposing for other public sector workers, which include county jailers and police dispatchers, Palmer said. The statewide firefighters' union also opposes the proposal. Palmer said he believes that Walker exempted police and firefighters not for political payback, but because they are the public workers who are most popular with the public. "And in that way, it’s very political," he said. Brazile said, "The firefighters, the policemen and others who supported (Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker) in his election bid ... don't have to worry about their collective bargaining rights." It’s true that Walker won the endorsement of Milwaukee police and firefighter organizations, and they won’t lose collective bargaining rights if Walker’s proposal succeeds. But not all unions supported Walker. In fact, the two significant statewide organizations endorsed his opponent, and they too would be exempt from restrictions on collective bargaining. Because the statement leaves out the fact that the police and fire unions broke ranks on whether or not to support Walker, we rate this statement Half True.

pomt-01894	Says Greg Abbott "has lost" in court "four times in just the past few days."	mostly true	/texas/statements/2014/jul/06/wendy-davis/greg-abbott-sustained-four-setbacks-court-though-h/	State Sen. Wendy Davis wink-admonished delegates to last month’s Texas Democratic Party convention not to "clap too much" for her "or Greg Abbott will sue you." Davis, the party’s nominee for governor, then noted that Abbott, the state attorney general and Republican gubernatorial choice, often boasts about going to work, suing the federal government and going home. In May 2013, we rated as True Abbott’s claim he’d sued President Barack Obama’s administration 25 times. "He is so proud of that," Davis said. "But what he doesn’t say is that our judges go to work; they rule against him and the people of this state win. In fact, he has lost four times in just the past few days. If he... were your lawyer," Davis said, "you would fire him on the spot." Four Abbott losses in a June jiffy? Davis's list of Abbott's "losses" By email, Davis spokesman Zac Petkanas pointed out news stories published over a week in June 2014 describing court actions while Abbott’s office separately responded that Davis failed to note key details. Let’s walk through how Davis backed up her statement before laying out Abbott’s objections. On June 16, 2014, according to a Dallas Morning News blog post, a state appeals court ruled a former Texas assistant attorney general, Ginger Weatherspoon, could proceed with her lawsuit charging she’d been fired for refusing to lie under oath about a judge. The story said: "The AG’s office has spent years trying to get the suit tossed, claiming, among other things, that Weatherspoon didn’t make a ‘good faith’ effort to blow the whistle to the right links in the chain of command. A three-justice panel disagreed, and issued an opinion Monday written by Justice David Evans that said Dallas County Judge Martin Hoffman did the right thing last year when he refused to grant the AG’s office its request for summary judgment." In the opinion, Evans said Weatherspoon reported suspected criminal violations to appropriate authorities inside the attorney general’s office. She "has sufficiently alleged that she made good faith report of a violation of law by another public employee to an appropriate law enforcement authority," Evans wrote. According to a June 18, 2014, news story in the Austin American-Statesman, a federal judge in Washington, D.C., ordered the state to pay almost $1.1 million in legal fees to lawyers who represented Davis and minority rights groups in a legal challenge to district boundaries drawn by the Republican-majority Legislature. The story said: "U.S. District Judge Rosemary Collyer’s order criticized lawyers in" Abbott’s "office for submitting a legal brief that devoted more effort to complaining than it did to answering the legal issues in the fight over lawyer fees." Collyer, an appointee of President George W. Bush, wrote: "This matter presents a case study in how not to respond to a motion for attorney fees and costs." Five days later, a state judge had spurned Abbott’s attempt to remove state District Judge John Dietz from presiding over the long-running public school finance case, the Statesman reported. Abbott, facing a likely legal defeat in the case as a whole, had argued emails showed the judge was biased in favor of school district lawyers seeking to have the state’s school-finance system declared unconstitutional, the story said. Visiting Judge David Peeples found Dietz had "acted in good faith, holding out-of-court conversations with plaintiffs lawyers because ‘he believed that all parties had agreed to let such discussions take place,’" the story said. The same day, the Texas Tribune summed up a U.S. Supreme Court ruling as the "latest loss for Texas in its ongoing campaign against the federal government and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency." The Tribune news story went on to say the court had "largely dismissed" Abbott’s "challenge of federal climate rules. Seven justices agreed that the EPA is allowed to regulate greenhouse gas emissions from most large industrial facilities, like power plants and factories." Based on the accounts offered by Davis, it looks like Abbott experienced an unappealable loss at the Supreme Court (the EPA case), the loss clearing the way for a former employee to have her day in court, plus two losses that could yet lead to appeals courts making win-or-loss rulings. Abbott's office objects Abbott's state spokesman, Jerry Strickland, said the turns were not so clear-cut. Besides, Strickland told us by email, Davis failed to note a criminal prosecution simultaneously completed by Abbott’s office. According to a Statesman news story posted online June 20, 2014, a Bastrop County jury sentenced a former teacher to 15 years in prison for sexually assaulting a student; the attorney general’s office handled the case after the Bastrop County district attorney’s office recused itself. Of course, Davis didn’t say Abbott had four losses uninterrupted. Strickland said of three of the results Davis was referencing: The decision enabling the former employee’s lawsuit to proceed was only procedural. "Citing the decision as a loss when the case hasn’t even gone before a judge is like saying a team won the game because they won the pre-game coin flip," Strickland said. The D.C. judge who awarded attorney fees also issued a stay on the decision, pausing her order so the state could appeal. The decision not to order Dietz’s removal from the school funding lawsuit didn’t determine how the finance lawsuit itself will be judged on the state’s appeal to the Texas Supreme Court. "No matter what happens on any day, in any motions in the school finance case, those decisions along the way are not the final word," Strickland said. Past those, Strickland said Abbott won the EPA case "on the issues we argued." Specifically, Strickland said, the high court overturned the EPA’s illegal greenhouse gas permitting scheme after determining that it ignored federal law, exceeded the authority granted the agency by Congress and violated the federal Clean Air Act. "That was precisely what the state argued and thus, this was a win" for Abbott, Strickland said. The court’s decision affirmed and reversed, in part, a lower court’s ruling in EPA’s favor. The justices basically said the EPA had exceeded its statutory authority when it interpreted the Clean Air Act to require certain kinds of permitting for industrial plants based on their greenhouse-gas emissions. On the other hand, the court concluded, the agency may continue to treat greenhouse gases as a pollutant subject to regulation under federal law. Expert analyst revisits EPA ruling For expert perspective, we asked Lyle Denniston, a reporter who analyzes Supreme Court decisions for the online Supreme Court of the United States blog, to speak to how Abbott and the state of Texas fared in the EPA case. Denniston said by email that states including Texas made arguments that paralleled those offered by lawyers for business firms--and those arguments prevailed. Specifically, he said, the states said EPA couldn’t bootstrap its regulation of greenhouse gases from motor vehicle exhausts into a broad regime of regulating greenhouse gases from industrial plants. Still, Denniston said, Texas fell short of a complete victory because the court didn’t agree the EPA has no authority to regulate greenhouse gas emissions from power plants and other stationary sources. Rather, he wrote, the court decided EPA could regulate greenhouse gases from sources already that were obliged, under law, to curb air pollution--meaning the agency could regulate 83 percent of greenhouse gas sources instead of the 86 percent that would have come under its regulatory sway if the administration’s broadest argument had stuck, Denniston said. Strickland, provided Denniston’s comments, cautioned against reading the high court’s ruling too narrowly. The case, Strickland emailed, "was about separation of powers, and the limits of EPA's authority. The court rebuked what they saw as a federal government that tried to rewrite the rules and laws, without legislative approval. This is a victory" for Abbott. Our ruling Davis said Abbott "has lost" in court "four times in just the past few days." Abbott sustained four legal setbacks, we conclude, but the Democrat's statement needs clarification. Three rulings could prove to be bumps along the road o’ litigation possibly culminating in Abbott wins. And in the EPA case, the justices partly agreed with Texas, though they upheld federal regulation of greenhouse gases as pollutants. Notably, too, just one of the referenced rulings involved the Obama administration. We rate this claim as Mostly True.

pomt-03909	"About two-thirds of all consumption is services. . . It was just the opposite" when the sales tax was enacted in the '30s.	mostly true	/ohio/statements/2013/feb/27/joseph-testa/ohio-tax-commissioner-joseph-testa-says-consumptio/	Ohio Gov. John Kasich has proposed a broad overhaul of the state’s tax system as part of his biennial budget proposal. At a news conference to unveil his plans, he called on Ohio Tax Commissioner Joseph Testa to help explain proposed changes in the tax code. The governor’s proposal includes cuts to the state’s personal income tax and a 50 percent income deduction for small businesses. One way some of that revenue loss would be offset is through changes to the state’s sales tax. While the 5.5 percent rate would be cut to 5 percent, the tax base would be broadened by applying it to most services. It now principally applies just to sales of goods. Testa, while explaining the plan, said the changes were long overdue and needed to address the evolution of the state’s economy over nearly eight decades. "About two-thirds of all consumption is services. The tax code has never been updated to address that. It was just the opposite (when the tax was enacted) in the '30s." PolitiFact Ohio decided to assess the tax commissioner’s claim. Ohio enacted its sales tax in 1935 as a way to raise revenue to help public schools that were struggling to pay their bills during the Great Depression. At the time, most schools received their funding through property taxes. Many Ohioans failed to pay their taxes because of the difficult economic times, according to Ohio History Central, an online product of the Ohio Historical Society. As a result, schools had less money to pay educational expenses. Prior to enactment of the Ohio Retail Sales Tax Law there were taxes on sales of cigarettes and gasoline, but on few other products. The new tax extended to nearly all goods, and dramatically increased tax receipts. It raised nearly $17 million for public schools in 1935. Some revenue also went to help local governments. Since then, the tax has remained focused on the sale of goods. The governor’s budget proposal, though, would add the tax to sales associated with nearly all services. Everything from haircuts and movie tickets to lawyer bills and real estate services would be subject to a 5-cent tax on every dollar. But what about Testa’s contention that Ohio’s economy has evolved and that transactions involving services now account for two-thirds of all personal consumption expenditures? We contacted Testa’s office to ask on what he based his statement. Were there numbers to support the reversal in spending habits? Gary Gudmundson, a spokesman for Testa, provided a chart that the Department of Taxation had prepared for the budget rollout. It attributed its figures to the Bureau of Economic Analysis, which is part of the U.S. Department of Commerce. For 1935, the year Ohio enacted the sales tax, it showed total personal consumption of $55.9 billion, with $31.6 billion (56.5 percent) going toward goods and $24.3 billion (43.5 percent) going to services. Not quite 2-to-1 in favor of goods, but goods sales accounted for a solid majority of purchases. Money spent on personal consumption climbed steadily over the years. By 2012 the total consumption figure was about $11.12 trillion. About $3.78 trillion (34 percent) was for goods purchases. About $7.34 trillion (66 percent) was for services. We checked and the numbers provided in the state’s chart match the Bureau of Economic Analysis data. It should be noted, though, that the data reflects money spent on goods and services on a national basis. The Bureau of Economic Analysis told us that it didn’t have state-by-state data. Gudmundson said the state had rough figures that only went back to the ‘80s, but that the expectation was that Ohio, as one of the larger states in the nation, would have economic experience similar to the national figures. State-specific numbers on production help bolster Testa’s contention, although production is not the same as consumption. In 2011, the state saw $326 billion in privately produced services and $102 billion in privately produced goods. The figures illustrate "the continuing shift in Ohio’s economy away from goods production and towards services," according to a report last year from Ohio’s Policy Research and Strategic Planning Office. So where does that leave Testa’s claim? He said that about two-thirds of consumption is for services, and on a national basis, data shows he is correct. One could reasonably conclude that the same trend holds true in Ohio. Testa also said it was just the opposite when the state enacted its sales tax. On a national basis, the goods purchases didn’t account for two-thirds of total consumption in 1935, but it was a significant majority. And the numbers support Testa’s overarching point that the economy has changed significantly since then to be a service dominated market. With those points of clarification, the tax commissioner’s claim rates Mostly True.	None	Joseph Testa	None	None	None	2013-02-27T16:59:31	2013-02-04	['None']
pomt-04031	Research shows that "a vast majority of arriving immigrants today come here because they believe that government is the source of prosperity, and that's what they support."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2013/jan/31/rush-limbaugh/limbaugh-says-immigrants-come-us-seeking-prosperit/	Florida Sen. Marco Rubio talked immigration recently with conservative radio host Rush Limbaugh, steering into an interesting side issue: why people come to the U.S. "You look at people that come from Latin America. They come to get away from stale, stagnant economies where the rich keep winning and everybody else keeps working for them because big government dominates those economies," Rubio said. To which Limbaugh responded: "Well, is that the reason that a majority of immigrants come to this country today? I know it used to be. They wanted to be Americans. They wanted to escape oppression. They wanted to become citizens of the greatest country on earth. I've seen a number of research, scholarly research data which says that a vast majority of arriving immigrants today come here because they believe that government is the source of prosperity, and that's what they support." Here, we’ll look into Limbaugh’s assertion that belief in an expansive central government is what draws people to our shores. Polling Hispanics We did not hear back from Limbaugh’s show, but we suspect that the research he referred to is a 2012 Pew Research Hispanic Center poll, asking Hispanics about their political ideology. The poll broke down the results by generation, so it’s possible to distinguish first-generation Hispanics (i.e., immigrants) from U.S.-born Hispanics. The poll, which queried 1,220 Latino respondents ages 18 and older, asked, "Would you rather have a smaller government providing fewer services, or a bigger government providing more services?" In the results, 75 percent of Hispanics said they preferred bigger government (compared with 41 percent of the general population.) A breakdown by generation showed an even greater skew: Among first-generation Hispanics (i.e., immigrants), 81 percent favored bigger government. In the second generation, 72 percent favored bigger government, and the figure fell to 58 percent in the third generation and higher. Steven Camarota, with the Center for Immigration Studies, a group that favors stricter immigration laws, pointed us to another Pew poll asking people’s opinions of socialism, capitalism and libertarianism. Among blacks, whites and Hispanics, Hispanics had the most unfavorable view of capitalism: 55 percent. Overall, 50 percent had a favorable view of capitalism, while 40 percent had an unfavorable view.) In Camarota’s view, "the general sentiment (of Limbaugh’s statement) seems to be right that a very large fraction -- of Hispanics anyway -- show a very strong sentiment toward what could be called progressive or liberal views of government." But that’s just Hispanics, and Limbaugh simply referred to "a vast majority of arriving immigrants." Camarota cited similar figures about Asian immigrants, also from Pew polling. In a 2012 survey, 57 percent of foreign-born Asians in the U.S. said they prefer a bigger government that provides more services, while 33 percent want a smaller government providing fewer services. So there is evidence that recent immigrants, at least among Hispanics and Asians, favor more government, which could reasonably be construed as a belief that "government is the source of prosperity," as Limbaugh said. But is that belief the reason people immigrate? Jobs & family Alex Nowrasteh, immigration policy analyst with the libertarian Cato Institute, dismissed Limbaugh’s claim as off-base. "If Rush Limbaugh was right, we would not have people leaving during a recession like we did," Nowrasteh said in an interview. "About a million unauthorized immigrants have gone home to their home countries because there are no jobs for them here." A separate study by the Cato Institute says "immigrants come to America today to build a better life through work, not welfare, just as they have throughout American history." It backs up this point with U.S. Department of Labor data on labor force participation. Among foreign-born people, the work rate was 67.9 percent in 2010, compared to the native-born rate of 64.1 percent. It’s worth noting that welfare benefits are generally not available to immigrants. Illegal immigrants, of course, cannot receive public services such as cash assistance or Medicaid at all, and legal immigrants aren’t eligible for five years. Other programs are totally inaccessible until they become citizens. "Undoubtedly, there are undocumented immigrants getting some of those things. But they are for the most part not eligible," said Jeffrey Passel, a demographer at the Pew Hispanic Center. Immigration patterns indicate that that "source of prosperity" isn’t what immigrants seek anyway. "Immigrants go to states that have smaller benefits for welfare recipients," Nowrasteh said. "They go to the states that have the fastest-growing economies. If they were coming for welfare, they’d go to the places with the biggest welfare states." A wide-ranging international survey by Gallup of people all over the globe found that 150 million adults worldwide would like to migrate to the U.S., making it by far the top desired destination. "Opportunity" was the most common reason given, meaning "the chance to join family members who are already in other countries, to start a new business, to express one's views without fear, or to live where children are treated with respect." Gallup also found that the human development index of the country of origin was a significant factor too. That index measures citizens’ health, life expectancy, schooling options and wealth. The poll found that the desire to migrate "tends to be higher in countries with medium to low human development." Our ruling Limbaugh said research shows that "a vast majority of arriving immigrants today come here because they believe that government is the source of prosperity, and that's what they support." Surveys of Hispanic and Asian immigrants show that majorities of immigrants favor bigger government, which could be the "source of prosperity" Limbaugh meant. But we could find no research to say that those views are what drive people to immigrate. Family connections and job opportunities in the U.S. are the most common reasons cited in studies. Limbaugh’s claim contains a grain of truth but makes a misleading causal connection. That fits our definition of Mostly False.

pomt-09879	John Holdren, director of the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy, "has proposed forcing abortions and putting sterilants in the drinking water to control population."	pants on fire!	/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/jul/29/glenn-beck/glenn-beck-claims-science-czar-john-holdren-propos/	As evidence that the country is closer to socialist than capitalist these days, radio and talk show host Glenn Beck recently made this claim about John Holdren, director of the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy: "I mean, we've got czars now," Beck said during his July 22, 2009, program. "Czars like John Holdren, who has proposed forcing abortions and putting sterilants in the drinking water to control population." Political figures like Holdren, who are little-known by most Americans, make easy targets. And Beck's biting quick hit on Holdren provides a healthy enough dose of outrage on which to hang his argument. But is it true? Beck's allegation has its roots in a book Holdren co-authored with Paul and Annie Ehrlich more than three decades ago called Ecoscience: Population, Resources, Environment . Conservative bloggers have quoted the book extensively, and often out of context, to make the point that Holdren has advocated positions such as the ones Beck stated. We obtained the book to see exactly what Holdren, then a young man, wrote (or co-wrote). The book is just over 1,000 pages, and it clearly makes that case that an explosion in population presented a grave crisis. Although it is a textbook, the authors don't shy away from presenting a point of view. As the preface states, "We have tried throughout the book to state clearly where we stand on various matters of controversy." In a section on "Involuntary Fertility Control," Holdren and the other authors discuss various "coercive" means of population control — including putting sterilants in the drinking water. But they stop well short of advocating such measures. Here's a few excerpts: "The third approach to population limitation is that of involuntary fertility control. Several coercive proposals deserve discussion, mainly because some countries may ultimately have to resort to them unless current trends in birth rates are rapidly reversed by other means. ... "Adding a sterilant to drinking water or staple foods is a suggestion that seems to horrify people more than most proposals for involuntary fertility control. Indeed, this would pose some very difficult political, legal, and social questions, to say nothing of the technical problems. No such sterilant exists today, nor does one appear to be under development. To be acceptable, such a substance would have to meet some rather stiff requirements: it must be uniformly effective, despite widely varying doses received by individuals, and despite varying degrees of fertility and sensitivity among individuals; it must be free of dangerous or unpleasant side effects; and it must have no effect on members of the opposite sex, children, old people, pets, or livestock. ... "Again, there is no sign of such an agent on the horizon. And the risk of serious, unforeseen side effects would, in our opinion, militate against the use of any such agent, even though this plan has the advantage of avoiding the need for socioeconomic pressures that might tend to discriminate against particular groups or penalize children." Later, the authors conclude, "Most of the population control measures beyond family planning discussed above have never been tried. Some are as yet technically impossible and others are and probably will remain unacceptable to most societies (although, of course, the potential effectiveness of those least acceptable measures may be great). "Compulsory control of family size is an unpalatable idea, but the alternatives may be much more horrifying. As those alternatives become clearer to an increasing number of people in the 1980s, they may begin demanding such control. A far better choice, in our view, is to expand the use of milder methods of influencing family size preferences, while redoubling efforts to ensure that the means of birth control, including abortion and sterilization, are accessible to every human being on Earth within the shortest possible time. If effective action is taken promptly against population growth, perhaps the need for the more extreme involuntary or repressive measures can be averted in most countries." And here's the part that some have interpreted as Holdren advocating for forced abortions. "To date, there has been no serious attempt in Western countries to use laws to control excessive population growth, although there exists ample authority under which population growth could be regulated. For example, under the United States Constitution, effective population-control programs could be enacted under the clauses that empower Congress to appropriate funds to provide for the general welfare and to regulate commerce, or under the equal-protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. Such laws constitutionally could be very broad. Indeed, it has been concluded that compulsory population-control laws, even including laws requiring compulsory abortion, could be sustained under the existing Constitution if the population crisis became sufficiently severe to endanger the society. Few today consider the situation in the United States serious enough to justify compulsion, however." This comes in a section discussing population law. The authors argue that compulsory abortions could potentially be allowed under U.S. law "if the population crisis became sufficiently severe to endanger the society." Again, that's a far cry from advocating or proposing such a position. In the book, the authors certainly advocate making abortions readily accessible for women who want to get them. But they never advocate forced abortions. Big difference. In response to the comments from Beck and others, Holdren's office issued this statement: "The quotations used to suggest that Dr. Holdren supports coercive approaches to limiting population growth were taken from a 1977 college textbook on environmental science and policy, of which he was the third author. The quoted material was from a section of the book that described different possible approaches to limiting population growth and then concluded that the authors’ own preference was to employ the noncoercive approaches before the environmental and social impacts of overpopulation led desperate societies to employ coercive ones. Dr. Holdren has never been an advocate of compulsory abortions or other repressive means of population limitation." Holdren's office also provided a statement from Annie and Paul Ehrlich, the co-authors: "We have been shocked at the serious mischaracterization of our views and those of John Holdren in blog posts based on misreadings of our jointly-authored 1000-page 1977 textbook, ECOSCIENCE. We were not then, never have been, and are not now 'advocates' of the Draconian measures for population limitation described — but not recommended — in the book's 60-plus small-type pages cataloging the full spectrum of population policies that, at the time, had either been tried in some country or analyzed by some commentator. Under questioning by Sen. David Vitter, R-La., during his Senate confirmation hearing, Holdren said he "no longer thinks it's productive to focus on optimum population for the United States. ... I think the key thing today is that we need to work to improve the conditions that all of our citizens face economically, environmentally, and in other respects. And we need to aim for something that I have for years been calling 'sustainable prosperity.'" Vitter continued with his line of question, asking directly, "Do you think determining optimal population is a proper role of government?" Said Holdren: "No, senator, I do not. ... I think the proper role of government is to develop and deploy the policies with respect to economy, environment, security, that will ensure the well-being of the citizens we have." But with regard to Beck's claim that Holdren "has proposed forcing abortions and putting sterilants in the drinking water to control population," the text of the book clearly does not support that. We think a thorough reading shows that these were ideas presented as approaches that had been discussed. They were not posed as suggestions or proposals. In fact, the authors make clear that they did not support coercive means of population control. Certainly, nowhere in the book do the authors advocate for forced abortions. Some have argued that Holdren's view of the imminent and grave global dangers posed by overpopulation should provide pause, given Holdren's current view that global warming now presents imminent and grave global dangers. That's a matter for reasoned debate. But in seeking to score points for a political argument, Beck seriously mischaracterizes Holdren's positions. Holdren didn't advocate those ideas then. And, when asked at a Senate confirmation hearing, Holdren said he did not support them now. We think it's irresponsible to pluck a few lines from a 1,000-page, 30-year-old textbook, and then present them out of context to dismiss Holdren's long and distinguished career.

pomt-09490	"Since 1981, reconciliation has been used 21 times. Most of it's been used by Republicans."	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/feb/25/harry-reid/reid-says-repblicans-have-used-reconciliation-more/	Although the Feb. 25, 2010, televised health care summit was billed by President Barack Obama as an attempt to forge some bipartisan agreement, it didn't take long for the talk to turn to reconciliation. Reconciliation is a legislative procedure adopted in 1974 to balance budget bills. It can be a complex process, but what you really need to know about a reconciliation bill is that it can be passed with a simple majority, rather than the 60-vote supermajority Democrats lost when Scott Brown of Massachusetts was elected to the Senate. In other words, it's an option some Democrats are mulling if a bipartisan plan cannot be achieved. In the Republicans' opening statement, Sen. Lamar Alexander, R-Tenn., said, "You can say that this process has been used before, and that would be right. But it's never been used for anything like this. It's not appropriate to use to write the rules for 17 percent of the economy." Alexander quoted Alexis de Tocqueville that the greatest threat to the American democracy would be the tyranny of the majority. Soon after, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid accused Republicans of having a bit of amnesia on reconciliation. "No one has talked about reconciliation, but that's what you folks have talked about ever since that came out, as if it's something that has never been done before," Reid said. "Now, we as leaders here, the speaker and I, have not talked about doing reconciliation as the only way out of all this. Of course it's not the only way out. But remember, since 1981, reconciliation has been used 21 times. Most of it's been used by Republicans for major things, like much of the Contract for America, Medicare reform, the tax cuts for rich people in America. So reconciliation isn't something that's never been done before." We'll set aside some of the hypocrisy here (see Reid's comments in 2005 when he talked about the "arrogance of power" when Republicans were mulling reconciliation). Similarly, we'll set aside the hypocrisy of Republicans who used reconciliation in the past, but now denounce it. The issue we're looking at here is whether Republicans have really used reconciliation bills more than Democrats, as Reid claimed. On Nov. 14, 2008, the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service put out a report on reconciliation bills between 1981 and 2009. There have been 22 of them, including three that were vetoed by President Bill Clinton. It's been used for health insurance portability (COBRA), nursing home standards, expanded Medicaid eligibility, increases in the earned income tax credit, welfare reform, start-up of the state Children's Health Insurance Program, major tax cuts and student aid reform. While some have tallied the Republican vs. Democratic report card on reconciliation based on the president in power at the time, we think it makes more sense to look at the party in power in Congress when the reconciliation procedure was initiated. By our count, eight of the reconciliation bills were initiated by a Democratic-controlled Congress. The rest, 14, were done by a Republican-controlled Congress. So by that measure, Reid is on target. "It's a legitimate argument," said Thomas Mann, a senior fellow in governance studies at the Brookings Institution. "And Reid is absolutely right. It has been used a lot, and more by Republicans than Democrats." On April 20, 2009, Mann co-authored an article in the New Republic, "Truth and Reconciliation: Sidestepping the Filibuster," along with Molly Reynolds, also of Brookings, and Norman Ornstein, a resident scholar at the American Enterprise Institute, which concluded that "Health reform 2009 style would be the most ambitious use of reconciliation but it fits a pattern used over three decades by both parties to avoid the strictures of Senate filibusters." Still, we think looking at all 22 reconciliation bills casts too wide a net. Many reconciliation bills were not even all that controversial, and enjoyed wide bipartisan support. But other ones have clearly involved policy decisions that otherwise would likely have failed. Only eight involved votes where the winning side had less than the supermajority threshold of 60 votes. One could argue those were the times when Congress got around the need for the standard 60 votes. But even among that smaller group, six of the eight came courtesy of a Republican-controlled Congress. By way of counterpoint, Brian Darling, director of Senate relations at the conservative Heritage Foundation, argues that any comparison of past reconciliation bills to one on health care is flawed. "This is a unique situation," Darling said. "It's completely unprecedented to use reconciliation to amend a bill that is pending in Congress but has not passed." Darling called the Democrats' threat of reconciliation a measure of last resort to steamroll through a bill that can no longer get 60 votes in the Senate and is unpopular with the American public. Whether or not a reconciliation bill on health care meets the intent of the legislative procedure is certainly a matter for legitimate debate. But Reid said reconciliation has been used 21 times since 1981, and that most of the time, it's been Republicans who have initiated it. We find that there have been 22 reconciliation votes, 14 of them by a Republican-controlled Congress, and that it makes more sense -- in light of the debate over making an end-run around the 60-vote threshold -- to focus on the reconciliation bills that passed without a supermajority. But even then, Republicans have reached for reconciliation bills more often than Democrats since 1981. We rule Reid's comment True.

pomt-02446	Says Debo Adegbile "was nominated to serve as a judge on the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals" and "was abruptly withdrawn by the administration."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2014/feb/27/pat-toomey/pat-toomey-says-barack-obama-previously-nominated-/	President Barack Obama’s pick to head the Justice Department’s civil rights division has dredged up a decades old controversy surrounding Mumia Abu-Jamal, a black radical convicted of killing a Philadelphia police officer. Obama nominated Debo Adegbile to be an assistant attorney general in November. Adegbile previously served as director of litigation at the NAACP’s Legal Defense Fund. Sen. Pat Toomey, R-Pa., co-authored an op-ed in the Wall Street Journal with Philadelphia District Attorney R. Seth Williams on Feb. 24 that said Adegbile was not fit for the post because he attempted to "seize on (the Abu-Jamal) case and turn it into a political platform from which to launch an extreme attack on the justice system." In 1982, Abu-Jamal was found guilty of murdering a Philadelphia police officer in a case that garnered national attention. The case went on for many years. In 2009, Adegbile was at the NAACP Legal Defense Fund when it filed an amicus brief before the U.S. Supreme Court, arguing that Abu-Jamal’s sentence was invalid because the jury was racially biased. Later, Adegbile was one of several lawyers to represent Abu-Jamal when prosecutors tried to reinstate the death penalty. Abu-Jamal is serving a life sentence without parole. But it was Toomey’s final salvo calling on Adegbile to withdraw his nomination that caught our attention. "Only three years ago, Mr. Adegbile was nominated to serve as a judge on the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. Months later that nomination was abruptly withdrawn by the administration. That would be the best course here." At PolitiFact, we won’t debate Adegbile’s credentials for this important position, nor weigh in on a decades-old controversy. But whether Adegbile was previously nominated by Obama for a position is something we can, and will, look at. Nominate vs. consider We perused through the record of presidential nominations. Adegbile’s name doesn’t appear prior to his most recent nomination to the Justice Department. So we then turned to Toomey’s office. They immediately conceded their error. "We should have written that he was under consideration," said Elizabeth Anderson, a spokeswoman for Toomey’s office. "He was not nominated." Presidents consider nominees all the time. Some considerations are more public than others. Former United Nations ambassador Susan Rice, for example, was publicly "considered" to be the secretary of state by Obama, but her name was never formally submitted for nomination after Republicans lined up against her. In the case of Adegbile, the Washington Post reported in 2011 that Obama "asked the American Bar Association to evaluate the credentials of Debo Patrick Adegbile, director of litigation for the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund Inc., for a seat on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit." More recently, the Los Angeles Times reported that "Florida lawyer Ben Hill, who was chairman of the bar association committee, said in an interview that Adegbile's name was withdrawn before he was rated by the group." Senate Republicans on the Judiciary Committee asked Adegbile this year why his name was withdrawn in 2011. Responding to a question submitted by Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, the ranking Republican on the Senate Judiciary Committee, Adegbile wrote: "I withdrew myself from consideration for a nomination to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit based upon my personal, professional and practical assessment that my family’s best interests were served by my decision to remain in my position at the NAACP LDF in New York at that time." In his op-ed with Williams, Toomey said Adegbile’s nomination was "abruptly withdrawn by the administration." But Adegbile contends it was his own doing. A spokesman for the White House also said Adegbile took himself out of the running. Toomey’s office pointed to a Washington Post story (which is actually a wire version of the aforementioned L.A. Times article) where it was reported that "the White House later withdrew his name." Finally, it’s worth noting that Obama has had a tough time filling U.S. Court of Appeals seats in the D.C. Circuit. It’s widely considered a stepping stone to the U.S. Supreme Court, and Republicans have repeatedly blocked his nominees. When the Senate Democrats invoked the so-called "nuclear option" to change Senate rules for confirming presidential appointments, it was to move ahead with three Obama appointees to the 12-member U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit. Adegbile’s confirmation for assistant attorney general now only needs a simple majority, which Democrats can arrange without help from Republicans. At the time he was being considered for the judgeship, Republicans could have forced a 60-vote threshold to confirm Adegbile’s nomination, if it reached that point. Our ruling Toomey, along with Williams, wrote that "Adegbile was nominated to serve as a judge on the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. Months later that nomination was abruptly withdrawn by the administration." Adegbile was never nominated, a point Toomey’s office conceded. He was considered for the job by Obama, but only briefly and not formally. Presidents considered many names before making an official nomination. The distinction is important, because having to pull a nomination after it's formally made is a less frequent occurrence and a more significant setback for an administration. We rate this statement False.	None	Pat Toomey	None	None	None	2014-02-27T12:11:58	2014-02-24	['United_States']
pomt-09158	"Almost 1 million children ... have no health insurance in this state."	true	/florida/statements/2010/jun/09/bud-chiles/bud-chiles-1-million-children-health-insurance/	Lawton "Bud" Chiles III, son of the late Gov. Lawton Chiles, announced his independent run for governor on June 3, 2010, by saying he'd be a voice for those who traditionally have been cut out of the democratic process. "I'm here to speak for 1 million Floridians who today are out of work, for almost 1 million children who have no health insurance in this state and for millions of Florida citizens like me, who believe that Florida can and must do better by its families and by its communities," Chiles said. Chiles, previously a registered Democrat, said he opted out of a Democratic primary with Chief Financial Officer Alex Sink after he spoke on the phone with Sink and she told him she plans to raise $30 million in the race. Sink denies using that figure. In this item, we wanted to check Chiles' claim that almost 1 million Florida children are without health insurance. The number is particularly surprising, given that the state operates a program called Florida KidCare, which provides free or heavily subsidized health insurance for many uninsured children under 19. To qualify for Florida KidCare you must be a U.S. citizen or an eligible non-U.S. Citizen (read the eligibility information here). The Florida Department of Health says that 1.8 million children are currently enrolled in the program. To begin to assess Chiles' figure we turned to the Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation, a group that analyzes health care policy. In October 2009, they produced a report called "The Uninsured, a Primer," which details the number of people insured and uninsured by race, gender, age and state. The report is based on Census information and averages 2007 and 2008 calculations to provide state-level data. Kaiser says the data comes with a margin of error between 5 and 7.9 percentage points. According to Kaiser, 18.3 percent of Florida's 4.3 million children under 19 are without health insurance, or about 787,000 children. Only Texas has a higher percentage of children uninsured, Kaiser found. Families USA, a national consumer health care group, said in an October 2008 study that 797,000 children in Florida were without health care (18.8 percent of all children). The study, like Kaiser's, relied on Census data and counted children under 19. Families USA found that over 60 percent of Florida’s uninsured children come from low-income families who likely are eligible for Florida KidCare. A third group, The Commonwealth Fund, found in a 2009 study that 18 percent of children 0-17 in Florida were without health insurance -- the highest percentage of children uninsured in the country. The Commonwealth Fund study did not attach a raw number like the Families USA and Kaiser surveys, but 18 percent is in the same range as the findings of the other two studies. In his announcement as a candidate for governor, Chiles said that almost 1 million children in Florida don't have health insurance. The most reliable and recent studies put the number at close to 800,000. Chiles uses the word "almost," which gives him some leeway. We rate his statement True.

pomt-06125	"Florida is considered the fourth-largest gambling state in the nation."	half-true	/florida/statements/2011/dec/27/ellyn-bogdanoff/ellyn-bogdanoff-said-florida-considered-fourth-lar/	Supporters of a proposed bill that would allow three massive destination casino resorts in South Florida often argue that gambling is already a big business here -- in fact, one of the largest in the country. "Florida is considered the fourth-largest gambling state in the nation, but it has let the industry drive policy decisions and that has produced the worst kind of gaming,'' Sen. Ellyn Bogdanoff, R-Fort Lauderdale, said in an October 2011 interview about her casinos bill. "To me, no kind of gaming is good, but we as policymakers have to decide, do we want gaming with five-star hotels or Internet cafes in strip malls?" That fourth-largest ranking claim has been repeated multiple times by Bogdanoff, including in a joint editorial with state Rep. Erik Fresen, R-Miami, and by other individuals, including former U.S. Rep. Lincoln Diaz-Balart. Diaz-Balart is a lawyer and adviser for the Genting Group, which has purchased the waterfront Miami Herald property with plans to build a mega casino-resort there. We wondered if the ranking is true. The roots of the claim Bogdanoff's legislative assistant, Aaron Nevins, told us that the source of her claim came from a Oct. 24, 2011, report by Bernstein Research, a leading watcher of gambling stocks. "Florida has more gaming options than Las Vegas," the report states. "There is currently $3.4B of gaming occurring in Florida or $7.4B if one includes the lottery ... There are 8 casinos in the state run by Native Americans. Seven of these are Seminole and one is Miccosukee. These casinos generated revenues of just over $2B in 2009, making Florida the fourth largest state for tribal gaming...." Setting aside the numbers for a second, the Bernstein report makes clear it is discussing tribal gaming not gaming overall in that section, a distinction not made by Bogdanoff. "She misspoke," Nevins told PolitiFact in a Dec. 20 interview. "Florida is the fourth-largest state for tribal gaming." Other measures, rankings What else is out there? We asked Nevins if there were any other sources that ranked states' gambling revenues -- and he quickly found a separate report about states' gambling revenues in fiscal year 2010 by the Nelson A. Rockefeller Institute of Government, a group that describes itself as the public policy research arm of the State University of New York. According to the Rockefeller report, 43 states operate lotteries, 15 allow commercial casinos, 12 have racinos, and over 40 states allow pari-mutuel wagering. Lotteries and casinos generate the bulk of gambling-related revenues. The report on Page 5 compares states' revenues from lotteries, casinos, racinos and traditional pari-mutuel wagering. In Florida, revenues totaled about $1.4 billion -- ranking the state third behind New York and Pennsylvania. The group also found that -- in the states where data was available -- Florida ranked third in Native American casino revenues, behind California and Connecticut. (A brief pit stop here to explain why the Bernstein and Rockefeller reports were billions apart on their Florida figures. The Rockefeller report cited about $1.25 billion for the lottery, which is the amount that went to the state's Education Enhancement Trust Fund, while Bernstein cited total lottery revenues of about $4 billion. Those figures can be seen in this chart on page 117 from Florida's Department of Economic and Demographic Research.) Now, back to the Rockefeller chart showing Florida at No. 3. How could Florida be ahead of Nevada, which had $829.3 million in revenues, placing at No. 12? This chart looks at gambling revenues from four sources -- lotteries, casinos, racinos and pari-mutuel wagering -- combined. Nevada only has one category here -- casinos -- while Florida has the lottery, racinos (race tracks with slot machines) and pari-mutuel wagering. But let's take a look at a few other charts in the Rockefeller report that examine states' gambling rankings in various ways: * States' reliance on gambling revenues: In fiscal year 2009, Florida was 15th at 3.3 percent. Nevada -- at 12.5 percent -- had the highest percentage of gambling revenue as a share of the state's own-source revenue. * States' share of nationwide gambling revenues: Florida was third at 5.8 percent behind New York and Pennsylvania for fiscal year 2010. * Gambling revenue per resident 18 & above: Florida was 21st at $94.4. Rhode Island was No. 1. * Gambling revenue as a percentage of personal income: Florida was 19th at 0.2 percent. West Virginia was No. 1. And there are even more charts in the report that compare gambling revenues between 2009 and 2010 and zero in on single sources of gambling such as racinos. But you get the picture -- each measure of gambling can result in a different state being the top, second or fourth. And we'll toss in one more source of state-by-state comparisons. We found a ranking of states related to commercial casino activity from the American Gaming Association's 2011 state of the states survey. For example, on state-by-state consumer spending, or gross gaming revenue -- what a casino earns before it pays taxes, salaries or other expenses, Florida ranked 16th in the country. On tax revenue, Florida ranked 15th. (The AGA is focused here on its definition of commercial casinos, which includes racinos -- but note these rankings don't reflect tribal establishments or the lottery.) And if you guessed Nevada as No. 1 for commercial casino tax revenue you'd be wrong -- Pennsylvania and Indiana were higher. How could Indiana be higher than Nevada? "Indiana ranks higher than Nevada because, while its gross gaming revenue is lower than Nevada, its tax rate is much higher, yielding a larger tax contribution from commercial casinos in the state," said Holly Wetzel, spokeswoman for the association. Check out this article from Stateline.org, a publication of the Pew Center on the States: "Nevada can still lay claim to being the nation’s leading casino state, with a total take of $10.4 billion last year, but casino revenue and casino tax revenue are two very different things. State tax policies for casinos vary widely. Tax rates often are higher for casinos located at racetracks, sometimes called 'racinos,' where the slot machines tend to be operated by the state lottery as opposed to the more traditional state regulatory gaming commission." What's the best source? So is there a preferred way to compare states to conclude which one is the largest, or fourth-largest, gambling state in the nation? Does it all depend on what point you want to make or what you are looking at? We posed those questions to experts in the industry as well as academics. Wetzel, of AGA, told us in an interview: "I don't think there is a right or wrong or agreed-upon way to measure it. It depends upon what question you are asking." Wetzel said most firms comparing markets look at gross gaming revenues -- what a casino earns before it pays taxes, salaries or other expenses. It can also be useful to look at tax contributions -- but there are different tax rates in various states. "You can slice it and dice it anyway you want to depending on what story you are wanting to get at," Wetzel said. "The way we rank it is gross gaming revenue." Lucy Dadayan, one of the authors on the Rockefeller report, agreed with Bogdanoff that gambling is already in Florida in a big way. "However, the statement by the senator isn’t made in terms of reliance on gambling, or on any adjusted basis," Dadayan told PolitiFact Florida in an e-mail. "So total gambling expenditures (which we don’t collect) is the best measure in that regard. From the figures we collect, I’d say total gambling revenues to the state are the most useful measure, and Florida is in the 3rd place by this measure. The choice of the measure is really dependent on the purpose of the comparison." Dean Gerstein, principal investigator for an in-depth gambling study done for the federal government in 1999 and now vice provost and professor at Claremont Graduate University, said the best measure depends on the point a person is trying to make. "A measure is a statistical construct designed to best match the concept you have in mind. If the concept is the sheer size of an industry, then total revenues/sales is the usual metric," Gerstein said. "If it is the significance of the industry to the 'local' economy, it is the industry’s local wages plus locally retained profits (including the tax rake) generated, as a percentage of local wage/profit retention/tax. "If you are interested in gambling by residents, you want to know how much the local residents gamble away per capita, regardless of where they do so. Hence all the CA residents who trek to Vegas are exporting money. But all the multinational corporations that own Vegas casinos are exporting profits. The preferred stat depends on what you are interested in, and it is important to think straight about this. Note that the states with the largest populations — CA, TX, NY, FL — tend to dominate any stat that is based in some part on total population, while Nevada and other small-pop mountain states will be down in the weeds. When you put population in the denominator (that is, 'per capita'), that changes things." Our ruling As Bogdanoff introduced her casino bill she said: "Florida is considered the fourth-largest gambling state in the nation..." But this isn't as simple as college football rankings. There isn't one universally accepted measure. Now, Bogdanoff's legislative assistant acknowledges she should have specified tribal gaming. But that said, Bogdanoff's broader point is certainly supported from the majority of research, which suggests that -- if you include the state lottery -- Florida is certainly a big gambling state. No. 4? That's a lot less clear and very much dependent on what you measure and how you measure it. On balance, we rate this claim Half True.

pomt-07313	The Massachusetts health care plan is "wildly unpopular" among state residents.	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/may/16/laura-ingraham/laura-ingraham-says-massachusetts-health-plan-wild/	On the May 12, 2011, edition of the Fox News Channel's’ O’Reilly Factor, host Bill O’Reilly and conservative commentator Laura Ingraham discussed a speech on health care given earlier that day by possible Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney. Romney’s speech was designed to draw distinctions between the Massachusetts health care plan passed when he was governor and the national health care law signed in 2010. In a separate item, we analyzed whether Romney was justified in calling the national law a "government takeover." Here, we’ll look at a comment Ingraham made regarding in-state public opinion about the Massachusetts plan. "Look, I like Mitt Romney," Ingraham said. "I think he's a really smart guy, and I think he would be a good president. ... On this, I don't get it, though, Bill. I mean, costs have gone up. It's wildly unpopular." We wondered whether the Massachusetts system was in fact "wildly unpopular" with Bay State residents. We found two polls that shed light on this question to one degree or another. One was conducted in early April 2011 by Suffolk University of 500 Massachusetts residents. In response to the question, "Do you think health care in Massachusetts is working?" the poll found that 38 percent said yes, 49 percent said no, and 13 percent were undecided. This would seem to provide a measure of support for Ingraham’s claim. However, the question was phrased more broadly than Ingraham’s claim because it referred to "health care in Masschusetts," which could include factors well beyond the state health plan, such as their own personal experiences with the specific doctors, hospitals and pharmacists they use. And even if the results were a direct commentary on support for the Massachusetts system, a split of 38 percent in favor and 49 percent against doesn’t indicate the state health care law is "wildly unpopular," as Ingraham said. Unpopular, perhaps, but not necessarily "wildly" so. A more appropriate yardstick for measuring the plan’s popularity is a survey taken by the Harvard School of Public Health with the Boston Globe in mid September 2009. Here are two questions that most directly address Ingraham’s claim. Both were asked of the 467 respondents who told the pollsters that they were aware of the law: Given what you know about it, in general, do you support or oppose the Massachusetts Universal Health Insurance Law? Support: 59 percent Oppose: 28 percent Don’t Know: 13 percent Do you think the Massachusetts Health Insurance Reform Law should be repealed, continued as the law currently stands, or continued but with some changes made? Repealed: 11 percent Continued as the law currently stands: 22 percent Continued but with some changes made: 57 percent Don’t know: 10 percent The first question found residents support the law by more than a two-to-one margin. The second demonstrated that residents were not entirely satisfied with all of the law’s provisions, but it did show that support for outright repeal was low -- only 11 percent. A major caveat to the Harvard poll is that it was taken a year and a half ago, and sentiment may have changed since then. (Support for the law did drop by about 10 points compared to a 2008 Harvard poll.) Still, the Harvard data, despite being older, directly addresses Ingraham’s claim and indicates she was wrong. "The statement about the plan being ‘wildly unpopular’ is unfounded given available polling data," said Robert Blendon, the Harvard researcher who helped do the poll. As for the newer poll, David Paleologos, who directed the poll in question, said the question has value, while acknowledging that it is broader in focus. "It’s a snapshot of how people feel currently about Massachusetts health care," he said. "I think that’s all we can garner from the question. … Unless questions are identically worded, a lot of the comparison is left open to one’s opinion." On the advice of experts, we decided not to consider a recent customer satisfaction survey commissioned by the government agency that runs the state health insurance exchange created under the law. That study found that 84 percent of participants in the Commonwealth Care program rated it 4 or 5 on a five-point satisfaction scale, while only 4 percent said they were dissatisfied. Some news accounts mistakenly reported that this was a poll of all Massachusetts residents, but it wasn't, so we don't believe that it's a valid yardstick for assessing Ingraham's comment. We should note that an estimated 400,000 Massachusetts residents -- or only about 6 percent of people living in the state -- have secured health coverage as a direct result of the law, according to the Blue Cross Blue Shield Foundation of Massachusetts. That has enabled 98.1 percent of Massachusetts residents to secure insurance -- the highest rate of any state. But that also means that the impact of the law has been indirect for more than 9 of 10 Massachusetts residents. Residents need to include a certificate of insurance when they file their taxes. More important, but less tangibly, they may find their insurance costs or their taxes going up due to how the law has reshaped the insurance market. And there is evidence that the increase in number of insured residents in the state has put pressure on primary care physicians, potentially leading to longer waits for service. Still, one Massachusetts political analyst, Tufts University political scientist Jeffrey Berry, said he didn’t detect a groundswell of opposition to the law among residents. "Massachusetts voters, like voters everywhere, are unhappy with rising health care costs," Berry said. "They see that in their insurance premiums -- every paycheck and every year, the rates go up. The reform for the uninsured passed during the Romney administration is, itself, largely invisible. People know it's there but don't know how it's working (or, unless they're on it, don't know how it works). There's very little press coverage of the program. In Massachusetts there is simply no controversy about the plan at this point. Most telling is that there is no real organized opposition to it and no effort in the state legislature to revise it." Berry concludes that Ingraham’s "wildly unpopular" claim is "wildly exaggerated." Additional data from the Harvard poll supports Berry’s sense that it’s actually apathy -- rather than opposition -- that’s shaping views of the Massachusetts plan. The pollsters asked, "Generally speaking, do you think this health insurance law is helping, hurting, or not having much of an impact on the quality of your health care, the cost of your health care and your ability to pay medical bills if you were to get sick." Here are the results: • On quality, 23 percent said the law was "helping," 14 percent said "hurting," and 55 percent said it was "not having much of an impact." • On cost, 19 percent said it was helping, 24 percent said it was hurting and 47 percent said it wasn’t having much impact. • And on people’s ability to pay their medical bills, 24 percent said it was helping, 14 percent said it was hurting and 53 percent said it wasn’t making much difference. In other words, for each of these three issues, either a majority or a plurality of respondents said the law wasn’t having a significant impact. So where does this leave us? The Harvard data contradicts Ingraham’s argument, showing a fair amount of support for the law in general alongside feelings that it’s not doing much for them personally. The Suffolk poll is more recent, but the question asked is too broad to speak directly to Ingraham’s claim. And we couldn't find any other support for Ingraham's claim. So we rate Ingraham’s statement False.	None	Laura Ingraham	None	None	None	2011-05-16T14:47:26	2011-05-12	['Massachusetts']
pomt-07514	"I have the No. 1 show on NBC."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/apr/08/donald-trump/donald-trump-says-his-show-no-1-nbc-he-right/	No one ever accused Donald Trump of being modest. So when he was asked in a combative Today show interview when he would formally announce a campaign for president, the tycoon said he was being respectful of NBC. After all, Trump said, his show The Celebrity Apprentice is the network's top-rated show. Here's the exchange with Today host Meredith Vieira: Vieira: "What are you waiting for?" Trump: "I hate to say it, I have the No. 1 show on NBC. Is that a correct statement? I mean, The Apprentice is doing great -- The Celebrity Apprentice." Vieira: "What does that have to do...." Trump: "It has a lot to do. It sounds so trivial, and I hate to even bring it up, but I'm not allowed to run during the show. You're not allowed to have the show on and be a declared candidate. It’s a great show and it’s got phenomenal ratings, and until that show is over, I can’t declare, because otherwise, NBC would have to take the show off the air, and I think that would be very unfair to NBC." This season's Celebrity Apprentice is the latest in a long-running NBC reality show that features celebrities ranging from a country singer to a Playmate of the Year competing in a series of challenges that include creating a children's book and selling pizzas. At the end of each show, one of them gets fired by Trump. So how do the ratings look? It depends whether you're referring to recent weeks or to the entire season. If you look at the most recent week’s Nielsen ratings, Trump is right. For the week ending April 3, 2011, The Celebrity Apprentice ranked higher than any NBC prime time broadcast show among adults age 18-49 -- the coveted demographic for television executives. We should note that the bar is pretty low to be the highest-rated NBC show these days. When you consider shows on all broadcast networks that week, The Celebrity Apprentice ranked 15th. And The Celebrity Apprentice was the only NBC show to rank in the top 22 -- behind 10 from CBS, eight from ABC and three from Fox. We’ll also note that for the previous week -- the one ending March 27 -- The Celebrity Apprentice finished third on NBC and 19th overall. Still, Trump's right for the most recent ratings. For the entire season, however, The Celebrity Apprentice is not the top-rated NBC show. Marc Berman, a senior television editor at AdWeek, provided us with the average Nielsen ratings for all 160 broadcast network shows between Sept. 20, 2010, and April 3, 2011 -- basically, the entire season to date. Here’s how the top NBC shows stack up for the 18-to-49 demographic: 1. Sunday Night Football (3rd overall) 2. Football Night in America pregame show (tied for 17th overall) 3. The Office (tied for 17th overall) 4. The Biggest Loser (tied for 34th overall) 5. The Celebrity Apprentice (tied for 36th overall) And here are the numbers for all ages: 1. Sunday Night Football (4th overall) 2. Harry’s Law (29th overall) 3. Football Night in America pregame show (33rd overall) 4. Law & Order L.A. (42nd overall) 5. The Celebrity Apprentice (44th overall) So in both categories, The Celebrity Apprentice ranks fifth behind a mix of scripted dramas, sitcoms, reality shows and Sunday football. By this standard, Trump is wrong to say he has "the No. 1 on NBC." "It’s misleading," Berman said. "His show is doing well for NBC, but it’s not the No. 1." So Trump's boast needs some context. He's right for the most recent ratings, but not for the season overall. We find his claim Half True.	None	Donald Trump	None	None	None	2011-04-08T14:09:38	2011-04-07	['None']
pomt-01140	"The reason why Cubans don't have access to 21st century telecommunications — like smart phones, like access to the Internet — is because it is illegal in Cuba."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2014/dec/19/marco-rubio/marco-rubio-says-castros-not-embargo-reason-cubans/	There’s a good chance most Cubans won’t be able to read this article. And the reason why — lack of Internet access — is a point of a contention between President Barack Obama and Republican Sen. Marco Rubio. Obama on Wednesday, Dec. 17 announced sweeping changes to the United States’ decades-old isolation policy against Cuba, promising renewed diplomatic relations and an easing of regulations on commerce. Obama said the drastic shift in approach to the Communist-controlled island would help bolster the Cuban people, who he said have suffered from America’s cold shoulder. "I believe in the free flow of information," Obama said. "Unfortunately, our sanctions on Cuba have denied Cubans access to technology that has empowered individuals around the globe." Rubio, a Florida Republican and a Cuban American, chastised Obama’s comments in an animated rebuttal. "The president said that the people of Cuba do not have access to advanced, 21st century modern technology for communications and telecommunications because of the U.S. embargo. That is false," Rubio said. "The reason why they don't have access to 21st century telecommunications — like smart phones, like access to the Internet — is because it is illegal in Cuba." Obama’s statement wasn’t as full-throated as Rubio made it sound. And some of what Obama suggested is true, experts told us. That said, Rubio has the better part of the argument that Cuba’s restrictive policies loom large over the debate. Cuba’s restrictions Cuba has less access to the Internet than most countries in the world. It is the only country in the Western Hemisphere with an Internet access rating of "not free" by Freedom House, a human rights advocacy group. Citing the National Statistics Office in Cuba, Freedom House said about 23 percent of Cubans have access to the Internet. But those numbers, while very low, are likely inflated: Many of those people have access only to a tightly controlled Cuban intranet that includes email and government-approved sites. Outside experts, Freedom House said, estimate only about 5 percent of people have access to the full World Wide Web. The government of Cuba maintains almost complete control over telecommunications industries in the country, and it uses a mix of repressive policies and price gouging to keep Cubans offline. Regulations essentially prohibit private Internet use in homes and it is illegal to access the Internet outside government-controlled methods. On top of that, the cost of even a basic computer is more than twice the average Cuban’s annual salary. Cubans who log on to the Internet do so via public, government-run access points. There, patrons deal with some of the slowest speeds in the world. And rates set by the government make it difficult for the average worker on a $20 weekly salary to consistently log on. Checking email costs $1.50 an hour. Access to the national intranet is $0.60 per hour, and international websites are $4.50 per hour, Freedom House said. Bloggers and dissenters are quickly shut down and, in many cases, imprisoned. Alan Gross, the imprisoned American contractor released by Cuba this week, was arrested for building telecommunications infrastructure on the island. As for smartphones, most mobile phones can send messages, even internationally, but cannot access the Internet. GPS and satellite capabilities are prohibited. An iPhone, if procured, would be a pretty dumb phone in Cuba. Cuban officials have recently indicated a potential shift in policy that could open the Internet to personal and mobile usage, but it’s also possible it will be limited to Cuba’s intranet and email. Such promises have been made before. Cuba installed a 1,600 kilometer fiber-optic cable between the island and Venezuela in 2011 with financial help from China (a project completed despite the U.S. embargo, it should be noted). It was supposed to increase speeds and access for Cubans. Actual advances have been modest. And it’s not as though the United States is the only country capable of supplying Cuba with telecommunications technology in today’s global economy. The regime has prioritized preventing political dissent over technological advancement. There’s no guarantee that will change if U.S. policy does. This is why Rubio is right in saying that the U.S. embargo is far from the only factor affecting access. Sure, Cuba is poor and has bad infrastructure, but there are poorer countries with better Internet access, said Larry Press, an information systems professor at California State University Dominguez Hills who writes a blog on Internet access in Cuba. When infrastructure improved in Cuba, access largely did not. "I think Rubio is closer to the truth than Obama," Press said. "Both have a degree of truth, but the Cuban government's fear of the Internet was a bigger hindrance than the embargo." The embargo effect Rubio was not quite right, however, when he said that Obama’s comment was unequivocally false. Obama said that U.S. sanctions on Cuba "have denied Cubans access to technology." This is true to a certain extent. Part of Cubans’ access problem has to do with the exorbitant cost of technology, relative to how poor the country is, and lifting those restrictions could help that problem. In 2009, Obama cracked the door open marginally for American telecommunications companies to operate in Cuba by allowing them to establish connectivity between Cuba and the United States, and letting satellite radio and television companies serve Cuban customers. Additionally, people could donate (but not sell) telecommunication devices like computers and phones to Cubans. The changes announced Dec. 17 further opened up the ability for U.S. companies to build telecommunications infrastructure in Cuba and it allows for the commercial sale of communication devices and software. Matt Borman, deputy assistant secretary of export administration, told PolitiFact that if American companies were able to compete with other foreign telecommunications suppliers in Cuba, there is an expectation that it would pressure the government to create more viable infrastructure. That could spur more Internet freedom. In a report published in 2010, the Brookings Institution made a similar argument. A of couple experts told us that Obama’s side carries weight because Castro has made an effort in recent years to ease some restrictions, such as lifting the ban on personal computers. (It may be hard to believe, but internet access in Cuba used to be even worse.) So the United States’ sanctions prevent Cubans from acquiring technology that is now legal, said Julia Sweig, an expert on Cuba and Latin America at the Council on Foreign Relations. Our ruling Rubio said that rather than the U.S. embargo, the reason why Cubans "don't have access to 21st century telecommunications — like smart phones, like access to the Internet — is because it is illegal in Cuba." "Illegal" is probably the wrong word. There are some ways to legally access the Internet in Cuba, but not in one's home, or on mobile devices, and not by connecting to the full World Wide Web. Internet use is primarily restricted to government-run access points that are heavily monitored. The usage rates, set by the regime, are so expensive that it is cost prohibitive for most Cubans to log on. Political dissenters are barred from publishing online and are punished if they do. The end result is similar to full prohibition: Cuba has one of the lowest rates of Internet access in the world. The U.S. sanctions have played a role in limited availability of technology. However, Rubio is right that the Cuban government has nearly complete control over the Internet. That isn’t a result of sanctions on telecommunication business activity in Cuba. Even if the United States fully repeals its embargo, government control over Internet access could continue. We rate Rubio’s statement Mostly True.

pomt-13824	"We flood communities with so many guns that it is easier for a teenager to buy a Glock than get his hands on a computer or even a book."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/jul/14/barack-obama/barack-obama-offers-flawed-comparison-between-teen/	President Barack Obama attracted attention for a bold assertion about how easy it is to obtain a gun during his speech at an interfaith memorial service for five officers slain by a sniper in Dallas, Texas. "As a society, we choose to underinvest in decent schools," he said. "We allow poverty to fester so that entire neighborhoods offer no prospect for gainful employment. We refuse to fund drug treatment and mental health programs. We flood communities with so many guns that it is easier for a teenager to buy a Glock than get his hands on a computer or even a book, and then we tell the police, ‘You’re a social worker, you’re the parent, you’re the teacher, you’re the drug counselor.’" Critics pounced on the Glock remark, saying Obama was making a misleading — or even outright false — comparison. But the White House said it had evidence to back up Obama’s line. So we decided to take our own look. What the White House says The White House offered PolitiFact several news reports to back up Obama’s case. The gist of these reports was that there are lots of guns to be found in low-income urban areas, but comparatively few books and relatively little access to the Internet. However, much of the evidence these articles provided was anecdotal, and none of the articles directly compared guns to computers or books --- not to mention Glocks, the specific make of handgun Obama cited. And none of the articles offered a rigorous academic comparison of the specific claim Obama made. For example: • One study by New York University researchers found a scarcity of children’s books in low-income areas of Detroit, Los Angeles and Washington. But the study looked at stores that sold books without taking into account public libraries or school libraries, which make obtaining books easier. More importantly, the study didn’t compare the availability of guns. • Several articles offered quotes by people familiar with low-income communities that included observations similar to what Obama said in Dallas. For instance, one Chicago resident told Al Jazeera America that getting a gun in her neighborhood is as easy as buying a pack of gum. "If you want a gun, you can just go get a gun," she said. "You got the money? You can get a gun." And D. Watkins, a young, African-American writer from Baltimore who wrote The Beast Side: Living and Dying While Black in America, told public radio host Terry Gross that he bought his first gun "from some dudes in the neighborhood that sold guns. It was simple. ... (It was) Business as usual. And it's still like that." None of these accounts offered a direct comparison of guns’ availability compared with books or Internet access. • One link referenced an academic study about a lack of access to food in low-income areas, but it did not address either guns or books. • A news report cited research about the relative lack of Internet access in low-income households. But another article the White House provided said that while teens in families making less than $50,000 a year are less likely to have access to a desktop or a laptop computer than teens in higher income groups, the rate even for the lower-income group is still pretty high: All told, eight of every 10 of these lower-income teens had access to a computer. In all, we find the White House’s evidence unpersuasive on Obama’s specific claim. There’s no hard data making his comparison. And on the question of access to computers, we found data showing a relatively high rate of Internet access even among lower-income teens. Problems with the comparisons We considered the meaning of Obama’s remark a few different ways — but none provide a slam dunk for his argument. He said it was easier for a teen to obtain a Glock over a book or a computer. It might be easier for some people in some places, but it’s still against the law. "It is already against federal law for someone under the age of 21 to buy a handgun, such as a Glock, from a licensed firearms dealer," said John R. Lott, Jr., president of the generally pro-gun Crime Prevention Research Center. And federal law on handguns also makes it unlawful for anyone "to sell, deliver, or otherwise transfer (a handgun) to a person who the transferor knows or has reasonable cause to believe is a juvenile" — that is, under 18. That means that any teen would have to break the law to make such a purchase. Alternately, they could barter for a handgun or steal one, which might be practical but would also be against the law. So let’s now consider the case of teens who are willing to break the law. One interpretation is whether a gun is cheaper to get than a book. Experts said the price of a "street" handgun can range between $50 and $500, depending on the local vagaries of supply and demand. Glocks in particular "are very expensive," said Alan Lizotte, a criminal justice professor at the University at Albany. Street Glocks without a criminal history would be especially tough, he said. That would make them easily more expensive than books purchased at a store, and certainly more expensive than books borrowed for free from a library. "There are 80 public libraries in Chicago and 95 public high schools and 92 private high schools in the city," Lott said. The second interpretation of Obama’s remark is the ease, or accessibility, of locating a gun. This is perhaps the most favorable interpretation for Obama, since credible research shows that there’s both a relative shortage of books and a relative surplus of guns in low-income neighborhoods. But it’s worth remembering that there don’t appear to be any studies that compare books and guns directly. In addition, there’s a lot of variation, neighborhood by neighborhood, across the country. "If there’s lots of street-gang activity where you live, you may know someone who can get you a gun," said James Alan Fox, interim director of the School of Criminology and Criminal Justice at Northeastern University. "If you live in a middle- or upper-middle class suburb, a gun may not be as accessible for a teenager. I wouldn’t know who to ask to buy a street gun." Some points for Obama Experts acknowledged, though, that Obama had a point with his remark, even if he made an imperfect comparison. "It is pretty easy for a teen to get a handgun at little cost and very quickly, at least in some places, including urban places," Lizotte said. That said, Jay Corzine, a sociologist and gun-policy expert at the University of Central Florida, called Obama’s framing "weird." "The most credit I can give the president is that the statement may be true in a very small number of cases that are dependent on the context -- location, day of the week, time of the day, cash in hand," Corzine said. Our ruling Obama said, "We flood communities with so many guns that it is easier for a teenager to buy a Glock than get his hands on a computer or even a book." There’s little doubt that in some lower-income and high-crime neighborhoods, it is strikingly easy for even teens to acquire a handgun. On this, there is ample anecdotal evidence. But buying a gun is not likely to be cheaper than buying -- or borrowing -- a book or securing access to a computer, even for teens in poor neighborhoods. On multiple levels, Obama’s comparison is flawed. We rate it Mostly False. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/08198a52-ac06-472b-8b7e-c51e47432be3	None	Barack Obama	None	None	None	2016-07-14T17:41:51	2016-07-12	['None']
pomt-12531	"The Wawa Welcome America festival (features) . . . America's largest free concert."	pants on fire!	/pennsylvania/statements/2017/apr/21/wawa-welcome-america/pants-fire/	On April 13, Wawa, Inc. and Welcome America, Inc., a nonprofit in partnership with the City of Philadelphia, sent out a press release to announce Wawa’s continued commitment to hosting Wawa Welcome America, Philadelphia’s Fourth of July festival. Wawa confirmed it will continue to host the 25-year-old celebration through 2019. The citywide, six-day festival includes fireworks, free museum admission and what the press release claims to be the largest free public concert in the country: "The Wawa Welcome America festival is the nation’s signature July 4th celebration in the birthplace of our nation. This multi-day, citywide festival features all FREE events such as America’s largest free concert, some of the nation’s largest fireworks displays, outdoor movie screenings, free museum days, neighborhood events and more." Last year’s celebration peaked at around 25,000, but that number accounts for the whole day’s worth of activities at Benjamin Franklin Parkway, from noon until the fireworks, which begin after the concert ends at 10 p.m. The attendance for the concert, which began at 5 p.m., dwindled last year to 6,500 due to escalating rainfall. Generally, Wawa Welcome America does attract a significantly bigger audience. In 2015, Philly.com reported that city officials estimated the crowd at the concert to be upwards of 175,000, with the full day’s attendance reaching 700,000 people. The lineup that year, curated by Philly native sons The Roots, snagged headliners Nicki Minaj and Ed Sheeran, as well as Jennifer Hudson. 175,000 people still isn’t the highest attendance at a free concert, though. Millions came out to celebrate the new millennium in Times Square’s New Year’s Eve bash in 2000. Each of President Obama’s inauguration events (with entertainment provided by Aretha Franklin in 2009 and Beyoncé in 2013) drew over a million people — in 2009 it was closer to two million. And, at the same time as Wawa Welcome America, there’s the July Fourth concert at the Capitol; last year the headliners of that, which also runs live on PBS and NPR, included country stars Gavin Degraw and Cassadee Pope, as well as Christopher Jackson, who played George Washington in the Broadway hit "Hamilton." The year before, Hunter Hayes and KC and the Sunshine Band led up to headliner Barry Manilow. All of these are free events — though some of them aren’t centered around the performances, like the presidential inaugurations — that include concerts that are free and open to the public. They fit the description. Melanie Sole, a spokesperson for Welcome America, explained it’s pretty difficult to accurately compare crowd sizes from events in different cities because "every city counts things differently and there are many factors to be aware of when comparing city to city." Crowd size estimates also tend to have political- and business-related biases. A prime example is the Trump administration’s claim that the president’s inauguration crowd was much larger than it appeared to be in aerial photos. Because of common biases and inaccuracies often involved in measuring crowds, Digital Design and Imaging Services markets itself as being able to provide an "accurate, defensible crowd count." Specialists there have offered crowd size estimates for major events in Washington D.C. like the recent Women’s March and Jon Stewart and Stephen Colbert’s 2010 Rally to Restore Sanity and/or Fear, which DDIS estimated drew 215,000 people, claiming only a 10 percent margin of error. The specialists at DDIS are able to provide some of the most accurate estimations of crowd size partly because of a kind of technology they developed themselves called a balloon test, which isn’t an actual balloon, but a ten inch orb tethered to float above a crowd and use laser rangefinders to scan the area. The Federal Aviation Administration bans flying helicopters over large gatherings for safety purposes, so without a balloon test it’s difficult to get a good aerial view for a measurement tool. Even without use of the DDIS’s resources, to get an even close to accurate estimate, "you must have high resolution photos, you must have orthographic views, and you must have lingering resources to determine a peak [in attendance]," President of DDIS Curt Westergard explained. It’s not an easy measurement to get correct. Inaccurate counts can lead not only to dangerous situations regarding people in the crowds getting swift access to resources in emergency situations, but also make comparing sizes at different events extremely difficult. "We make our comparisons to other publicly reported data by other Independence Day concerts plus review available data from the music industry and other sources," Sole said of Welcome America’s crowd size estimations. She added, "No other free Independence Day concert in America makes our claim nor has sought trademarks as ‘America’s Free Largest Independence Day Concert.’ There may be other data not publicly available or known to us." Even assuming the estimations Welcome America is relying on are accurate, 175,000 people definitely isn’t the largest free concert audience in the United States, as shown above. Concerts at inauguration events and New Year’s Eve celebrations regularly top that count. In a separate email, Sole added quite a few more qualifiers to the initial statement, asserting that the Wawa Welcome America concert is the "longest, diverse, inclusive, free, live concert event on July 4th—Independence Day." Even restricting the comparison to that day, Philadelphia’s concert still isn’t the biggest. Washington, D.C.’s concert has drawn up to 250,000 people in past years, reports The Washington Times. Though the National Park Service no longer provides a count, the Metro system, which provides estimates of crowd sizes by measuring the amount of people using transit, said their count reached 500,000 for 2013’s celebration. Sole also provided a list of additional criteria Welcome America uses to distinguish its event as the biggest nationwide: • The Parkway is one continuous space with unobstructed views from Love Park to the Main stage for one, continuous, live concert experience. The Parkway can accommodate a range of crowds compared to other venues in other cities that may have multiple "official" sites. • Factors in the counting of attendees--over time--include the timing of the Parkway pre-concert entertainment, the length of the live concert, diversity of performers, audience appeal, fireworks timing, weather and other factors (such as day of the week—this year July 4th is a Tuesday versus a long weekend or weekend day itself). • Review of Philly’s July 4th historical data and the Independence Day crowd estimates reported over time by the media and other sources along with visual evidence (such as pictures and videos). • We include live broadcast ratings and live streaming viewers. All portions of Philly’s events are live, never taped. However, none of these criteria were included in the original statement, which just claimed Wawa Welcome America features the largest free concert in the country-- not just on the Fourth of July and not based on the diversity of performers or the length of the live concert or whether the view of the stage is continually unobstructed. Today, Welcome America put out another announcement unveiling Mary J. Blige as the headliner for this year’s concert. This press release instead lauded the event as "America’s largest free Independence Day concert." Our ruling The original claim in Wawa and Welcome America’s press release stated Wawa Welcome America features America’s largest free concert. Welcome America Spokesperson later reiterated in an email that the organization measures a variety of factors including length of the concert, whether it’s live and whether there is an unobstructed view of the stage throughout the crowd. She also revised the initial claim and instead referred to the concert as the largest one in the US on Independence Day (which is still not totally accurate). Regardless, what we’re fact checking is the original statement from the press release. Philadelphia can certainly claim it has a pretty huge Independence Day celebration, but Wawa Welcome America is definitely not the largest free concert in the United States. We rate this claim as Pants on Fire.	None	Wawa Welcome America	None	None	None	2017-04-21T13:40:09	2017-04-13	['United_States']
pomt-04191	Social Security has not contributed to the debt and the deficits.	mostly false	/new-hampshire/statements/2012/dec/10/jeanne-shaheen/social-security-doesnt-contribute-national-debt-sa/	When it comes to the fiscal cliff, U.S. Sen. Jeanne Shaheen is willing to consider anything to ease the fall. Everything, that is, except for one key federal program. "I think we do need to take Social Security off the table because Social Security has not contributed to the debt and the deficits," Shaheen said Tuesday, Nov. 27 in an interview on MSNBC’s Jansing and Co. "We do need to fix it for the long-term," she said. "But that's a different discussion than the one that we're having about those programs that are actually costing." We’ve heard claims like this before. In August 2011, PolitiFact gave a Mostly True ruling to a claim that Social Security didn’t cause the debt crisis. At the same time, we ruled Mostly False on a claim that Social Security doesn’t contribute a penny to the deficit. We decided to take another swing at it. To start, we approached representatives from Shaheen’s Senate office, who reminded us that Social Security is a self-financed program, funded primarily through dedicated payroll taxes. In most years, including the period from 1984-2009, the program takes in more money than it distributes in benefits, creating a surplus. Those surplus dollars add to the Social Security trust funds, which currently hold about $2.7 trillion in assets. The two trust funds -- one dedicated to old age and survivors’ insurance and the other committed to disability insurance -- collect interest over time. And that interest only adds to the surplus, thereby reducing the deficit, according to Paul Van de Water, a senior fellow at the liberal Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. Including interest, the Social Security trust funds held a surplus of $69 billion in 2011, $68.6 billion in 2010 and $121.7 billion in 2009, according to Social Security Administration records. "To that extent, it’s actually reducing the overall federal deficit," Van de Water said. But, other analysts argue the interest payments earned by Social Security only amount to a re-shuffling of government dollars. As noted in the prior PolitiFact rulings, the Social Security trust funds may be considered separate, but, in reality, they are not "locked boxes" or closed-off savings accounts. Rather, Social Security is required by law to put its entire surplus into interest-earning government bonds. The dollars invested in Treasury bonds are frequently mixed and invested with other revenue sources in the government’s general fund, and, together, the money is used for other government purposes, including spending, repaying debts and cutting taxes. So, when the Social Security trust funds collect interest, they are merely accepting money from other parts of the government, according to Howard Gleckman, an analyst for the Tax Policy Center, a joint effort between the Brookings Institution and the Urban Institute. Without considering interest, Social Security has actually been running a deficit over recent years, Gleckman noted. And, when Social Security runs a deficit, the program draws on interest from the Social Security bonds, forcing government officials, already operating at a deficit, to borrow more money from other sources to make up the difference. "It’s an accounting fiction," Gleckman said of the interest payments. "It helps make the Social Security funds look more solvent, but really you've just taken (money) out of general fund. … The money is simply being transferred from one government account to the next." In 2010, the program ran a "cash deficit" of $49 billion, according to the Social Security Administration’s summary of its 2012 annual report. The following year, the deficit stood at about $45 billion, and, looking forward, the program’s future doesn’t look much brighter. Social Security trustees project the program’s cash deficit to exceed $60 billion over the next few years, and by 2033, the trust fund will no longer have enough money to cover full benefits for beneficiaries, according to the most recent estimates. "The Trustees project that (the deficit) will average about $66 billion between 2012 and 2018 before rising steeply as ... the number of beneficiaries continues to grow at a substantially faster rate than the number of covered workers," according to the annual report. Lawmakers from both parties have proposed ways to bridge the gap and salvage the program. But, with the insolvency date looming, Social Security stands to have an even greater effect on the debt moving forward, according to Laurence Kotnikoff, an economics professor at Boston University. "Nobody can claim Social Security isn’t part of the overall problem," Kotnikoff said. "It’s all labeling games. … It absolutely contributes to the overall fiscal situation. It’s in terrible shape." Our ruling: Social Security is designed as a self-supporting, pay-as-you-go program, in which current payroll taxes pay for current benefits. This played out for many years, and with interest, the program has built up an annual surplus, which appeared to help offset the national deficits. But, in reality, Social Security is not closed off from the rest of the government. The program’s surplus funds are frequently invested in Treasury bonds, and during surplus years, the bonds earn interest paid with other government dollars. And in recent years, the amount of taxes collected have not equaled the benefits distributed, leaving the Social Security funds facing a cash deficit, which then forces the government to borrow more money to offset. This was the case in 2010 and 2011, and Social Security trustees anticipate higher deficits looking forward. While there’s a case for both interpretations, we see clear evidence that Social Security does affect the nation’s debt and deficit. We rate Shaheen’s claim Mostly False.

pomt-04106	"[W]e see America's prison population exploding, with America having a greater percentage of its people behind bars than any other nation in the world!"	mostly true	/georgia/statements/2013/jan/14/hank-johnson/does-us-have-highest-percentage-people-prison/	A Georgia congressman recently penned a letter to an American legend that sparked some conversation among the PolitiFact Georgia staff. U.S. Rep. Hank Johnson, a Democrat who lives in DeKalb County, decried the large number of Americans incarcerated, among other things, in a message to Frederick Douglass, the famed 19th-century abolitionist, author and activist. The letter was written to commemorate the 150th anniversary of the Emancipation Proclamation, written by President Abraham Lincoln to end slavery. "[W]e see America's prison population exploding, with America having a greater percentage of its people behind bars than any other nation in the world!" wrote Johnson, a former magistrate court judge. PolitiFact Georgia examined a similar claim by Johnson before. The congressman claimed last year that the United States imprisons more than any nation in the world. PolitiFact Georgia found Johnson was likely correct that the U.S. has more people behind bars than any other country, but America does have one of the largest populations in the world, so it’s not entirely an apples-to-apples comparison. Our research showed there are probably some nations with a higher percentage of people in prison, so we rated Johnson’s claim Half True. We were slightly surprised by this claim floating around again. We wondered whether there was anything new to consider on this issue since we fact-checked it in May. This time, Johnson was talking about the percentage of people in jail, not the total prison population as he did last year. We decided to take a look. Last year, the estimates we found all said there were about 2.3 million people in U.S. prisons. That’s about 730 people in prison for every 100,000 Americans. The estimate remained about the same. The International Centre for Prison Studies, based at the University of Essex in Great Britain, keeps the most detailed information about prison populations worldwide. Its World Prison Population List is widely used in studies and by reporters. In the report we reviewed last year, the U.S. had the highest percentage of its citizens in prison among nations where the ICPS could verify such information. Russia and Rwanda ranked second and third, respectively. Both countries were well behind the United States. Russia had 598 people in its prisons per 100,000 citizens. As for China, the most recent ICPS report states that nation has at least 1.6 million people in its prisons. The number may be as much as 2.3 million if you include an estimated 650,000 held in detention centers. Using the larger estimate, that would be 170 people per 100,000 Chinese citizens, which is far lower than the U.S. At the time, we found it was possible that there were two other countries that put a greater percentage of people in prison: Cuba and North Korea. Has that changed? First, let’s look at Cuba. A 2003 study reported in The Miami Herald found an estimated 100,000 inmates in 200 prisons and labor camps spread across the Caribbean island. Several prominent human rights organizations did not dispute the figure. In 1995, the United Nations estimated there were "between 100,000 and 200,000 prisoners in all categories,'' the Herald reported. "If accurate, the figure of 100,000 inmates in an island of nearly 11.3 million people would give Cuba 888 inmates per 100,000 people, far ahead of the United States," the Herald article said. Johnson’s office sent us information that suggests the number of prisoners on the island may be much lower. The most recent ICPS report shows the prison population was 510 people per 100,000 residents as of May. In May 2011, Amnesty International compiled a report on North Korea and concluded there were an estimated 200,000 people being held in political prisoner camps. The estimate was based on satellite images and eyewitness accounts. That equates to 813 per 100,000, higher than the U.S. The ICPS has similar totals for North Korea, citing the South Korean National Human Rights Commission. North Korea’s total cannot be independently verified. "Otherwise, without any firm, recent, quantified statistics involving North Korean figures, it is very difficult to evaluate whether the statement that they have higher incarceration rates is accurate," said Andy Phelan, a spokesman for Johnson. "It is, however, entirely accurate to state that the United States has the highest reported incarceration rate, as well as the highest total prison population, based on the most recent studies." The United States has the highest percentage of people in its prisons of any nation that can be verified. From the most recent numbers we’ve seen, the U.S. may have a higher percentage than one nation (Cuba) we thought had more of its people in prison. We’ll give Johnson a higher grade this time on the Truth-O-Meter but still leave room for another country (North Korea, perhaps) that may have a higher percentage of its people in prison. Our rating: Mostly True.	None	Hank Johnson	None	None	None	2013-01-14T06:00:00	2013-01-01	['United_States']
pomt-01217	"In Rhode Island, a recent study showed that among a group of people who had been homeless for a year or more, Medicaid costs averaged about $60,000 per person."	false	/rhode-island/statements/2014/nov/23/anne-nolan/crossroads-head-anne-nolan-says-long-term-homeless/	The head of Rhode Island's largest homeless shelter argued in a Nov. 12, 2014 Providence Journal commentary that the costs of not finding someone a home can be very high. Anne Nolan, president of Crossroads Rhode Island, reported that, "In Rhode Island, a recent study showed that among a group of people who had been homeless for a year or more, Medicaid costs averaged about $60,000 per person, which is far higher than the typical $18,096 per person per year for disabled adults on Medicaid and $9,240 per person per year for the average Medicaid recipient." That's a huge difference. We were curious about whether those numbers were accurate and why the gap was so large. Medicaid is a joint state-federal, government health-care program for the very poor. Nolan’s commentary referenced the 2013 "Rhode Island Annual Medicaid Expenditure Report," developed by the state's office of Health and Human Services. We located the report, but we couldn't find any numbers that matched Nolan’s. So we emailed her to make sure that was really her source. She replied that the information actually came from a June 1, 2014, report by Providence College sociologist Eric Hirsch, in which he identified 5,986 Rhode Islanders who had spent at least one night in an emergency shelter over a 28-month period and discovered that 2,308 were covered by Medicaid. Their Medicaid expenses totaled $58 million. Hirsch doesn't calculate the cost per person, so we did. It's $10,795 per person per year. That's pretty close to the average for all Medicaid recipients and a far cry from $60,000. So where did Nolan get her $60,000 figure? In his report, Hirsch wanted to make the point that those costs were not evenly distributed among the homeless. "In fact," he wrote, "the 67 individuals who were homeless for one year or more and had the highest Medicaid bills had total charges of $9,325,375." That's $139,185 per person for these 67 people" over 28 months. "The corresponding annual charge was just under $60,000 per person," Hirsch wrote. But we immediately noticed a problem -- $60,000 isn't the average for all long-term homeless people. It's only for the 67 people who racked up the highest Medicaid bills, a distinction Nolan didn't make in her commentary. When we contacted Hirsch, he explained that, "We do want to be able to argue that it would be most cost effective to house the most vulnerable." In other words, finding housing for 'high cost' homeless are going to save the most money. He said he used an arbitrary cutoff -- expenses of $47,000 or more -- to identify the high-cost users. Because Nolan was talking about all long-term homeless on Medicaid -- not just the 67 with the highest bills -- we asked Hirsh for the information on the larger group. He went back to his data and reported to us that there were 442 long-term homeless people who had, on average, $23,650 in Medicaid charges per person per year. Although that's double the amount for the typical person who was homeless for at least one night, it's dramatically less than $60,000. When we wrote back to Nolan asking if she was aware that the $60,000 figure only applied to homeless Medicaid patients with the biggest bills, she said she had misinterpreted the report. Finally, for the record, Hirsch and Nolan erred when they said the average Medicaid cost is $18,096 per person per year for disabled adults. As Hirsch reported when we questioned the figure based on the state Medicaid report, the correct amount is $21,696. Our ruling Anne Nolan said Rhode Islanders who have been homeless for at least a year cost Medicaid an average of $60,000 per person per year. But the $60,000 cost she cites applied only to the 67 homeless people with the highest medical bills, a major caveat she didn't mention in her commentary. The annual dollar amount for all Medicaid recipients in the study who were homeless for at least a year was $23,650 -- a substantial cost to taxpayers, but far less than what Nolan indicated. Because Nolan's statement makes it sound like it applies to all long-term homeless people on Medicaid when, in fact, it only focuses on the most-expensive subset, we rate it False.

pomt-10289	The musical Mamma Mia! has "been selling out for years."	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/aug/15/john-mccain/mccain-knows-abba/	John McCain may not know much about culture, but he knows ABBA. At a town hall at the Aspen Institute on Aug. 14, 2008, McCain conceded that he didn't know a lot about art and music. New York Times reporter Katharine Seelye wrote that McCain said if he's "lacking in anything," it is an appreciation for music and art and "the other great things in life," partly because he spent 5 years as a prisoner of war. But then the 71-year-old senator launched into a defense of the Swedish pop band ABBA. "Everybody says, 'I hate ABBA, Oh, ABBA, how terrible, blah, blah, blah.' How come everybody goes to Mamma Mia! ?" McCain said. "Everybody goes! They've been selling out for years." We wondered if McCain was right that Mamma Mia!, the musical based on ABBA's recordings, has been "selling out for years." First, we will assume that McCain was referring to the stage version, which has been playing on Broadway since 2001, not the movie version, which opened this summer. The Broadway show's Web site says the stage production, which has been performed in eight languages, has been seen by more than 30-million people in over 170 cities. The Web site calls it "the ultimate feel-good show." And McCain seems to be keeping up with Broadway box office receipts. TicketNews, which tracks Broadway receipts, reports that Mamma Mia! is still selling out. For example, it sold out its performances the weeks ending Aug. 3 and Aug. 10, selling about 101 percent of its seats (the number exceeds 100 because it includes standing-room tickets). A survey of other weeks in the past year found the show nearly sold out or exceeded capacity. Alfred Branch Jr., news editor of TicketNews, told us that the show is "a virtual sellout most nights." So McCain is right that Mamma Mia has been selling out for years. This claim is True.	None	John McCain	None	None	None	2008-08-15T00:00:00	2008-08-14	['None']
pomt-02407	Under Scott Walker, Wisconsin "unemployment's up" from 4.8% to 6.2%	pants on fire!	/wisconsin/statements/2014/mar/07/mary-burke/democratic-challenger-mary-burke-says-wisconsin-un/	Even as it became clear that he's not on track to deliver 250,000 jobs by January 2015, Gov. Scott Walker has repeatedly told voters that Wisconsin’s unemployment rate has gone down since he took office in January 2011. News articles have chronicled a gradual decrease in the rate, including a report that it dipped to a five-year low in November 2013. And yet, with her first TV ad in the 2014 gubernatorial campaign, Democratic candidate Mary Burke contradicts that notion. Midway through the ad, unveiled March 5, 2014, the narrator says that "under Walker, unemployment’s up." Simultaneously, a figure on the screen changes from 4.8 percent to 6.2 percent. So, under Walker, has unemployment really gone up? And what are the numbers? What Burke says The ad starts by touting Burke. It cites Wisconsin jobs at Trek Bicycle Corp., the Burke family business, where Mary Burke worked as an executive years ago. And it states that Wisconsin had 72,000 more jobs when Burke served as state commerce secretary than it does today. (The 72,000 is an updated version of a claim Burke made in October 2013, which we rated Half True. She was correct on the number -- 84,000 at that time -- but overstated the credit she and Democratic Gov. Jim Doyle deserved.) Then the ad stops talking about Burke and transitions to Walker, citing anti-Burke ads from what it calls "Walker's" Republican Governors Association. Walker is a member of the national association's executive committee and was vice chairman in 2013. The narrator then says that "under Walker, unemployment’s up." That’s when the figure on the screen spins from 4.8 percent to 6.2 percent. The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, the federal government’s official jobs counter, is footnoted as the source. The narrator continues the attack on Walker by saying job prospects are down and layoffs continue. Regarding the unemployment rate claim specifically, Burke spokesman Joe Zepecki told us: "We're not examining it in terms of (Walker’s) time in office overall -- we're comparing it what it was when Burke was commerce secretary." But that's not what the viewer sees and hears when the ad pivots from praising Burke to attacking Walker. It talks only about Walker; it doesn’t compare him to Burke. Moreover, with the narrator’s words presented along with the two percentages on the screen, Burke’s message is that unemployment during Walker’s time as governor has risen from 4.8 percent to 6.2 percent. But unemployment was much higher than 4.8 percent when Walker took office. And the trend since then has been down, not up. Rates are down Asked for evidence to back the claim, Zepecki did not cite numbers from the start of Walker’s tenure. He told us that on an annual average, Wisconsin’s unemployment rate was never higher than 4.8 percent during the more 2 1/2 years that Burke was commerce secretary. In contrast, Zepecki said, the monthly rate under Walker has never been below 6.2 percent. We reviewed monthly figures from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the federal agency cited in the ad. -- When Burke served as state commerce secretary -- February 2005 to November 2007 -- Wisconsin's unemployment rate was steady. It started at 4.8 percent, hit a high of 4.9 percent in June 2007 and went as low as 4.6 percent, which was the rate when she left. -- After Burke left the commerce post, unemployment rose, and later dropped, during the rest of Doyle’s second term as governor. The rate peaked three times at 9.2 percent, including as late as January 2010, then eventually fell to 7.8 percent in December 2010, Doyle’s final full month in office. -- Under Walker, the highest unemployment rate has been 7.7 percent -- including in January 2011, the month he took office. Since then, the rate has gradually trended downward, with a bump up here and there, to a low of 6.3 percent in December 2013, the latest month available. (A footnote: The state Department of Workforce Development had reported the December 2013 rate one notch lower, at 6.2 percent. A spokesman for the state agency told us the federal Bureau of Labor Statistics revised the figure to 6.3 percent after the state agency announced its number.) So, without stating any comparison between Burke and Walker, the ad claims unemployment is higher under Walker and provides figures indicating an increase from 4.8 percent to 6.2 percent. But the rate was much higher than 4.8 percent when Walker took office and it has gone down, not up, during his tenure. Our rating Burke's said that "under Walker, unemployment’s up," from 4.8 percent to 6.2 percent. Burke defends the claim by saying 4.8 percent is a reference to when she served as state commerce secretary, which was several years before Walker became governor. But the ad gives no indication that that is the comparison she is making. Moreover, during Walker’s time as governor, unemployment started at 7.7 percent, not 4.8 percent. And rather than trending upward, the rate has steadily dropped to 6.3 percent. For a claim that is false and ridiculous, we give Burke a Pants on Fire.

pomt-08360	The lawyer who brought the case against NationsBank said "publicly that Alex Sink had nothing to do with the case, had nothing to do with the situation and didn't know about the problems."	mostly true	/florida/statements/2010/oct/26/alex-sink/alex-sink-says-lawyer-backs-claims-she-didnt-know-/	In their third and final gubernatorial debate on Oct. 25, 2010, Rick Scott and Alex Sink traded accusations that each has been party to fraud. Sink again hammered Scott for his time running Columbia/HCA and the hospital company's convictions and $1.7 billion in fines for defrauding Medicare and Medicaid. But this time Scott countered with allegations that Sink was the president of NationsBank operations in Florida when that company was accused of fraud and forced to pay government fines and settle a class-action lawsuit. Unlike Scott, Sink said she had what amounts to a get-out-of-jail-free card. "That case, the lawyer that brought that case -- it was a class-action case against another company -- he even has said publicly that Alex Sink had nothing to do with the case, had nothing to do with the situation and didn't know about the problems," Sink told CNN's John King and the St. Petersburg Times' Adam C. Smith, the debate's moderators. "What more can I say?" In a separate item, we dealt with Scott's accusations. You can read that item, here. In this fact check, we'll explore Sink's rebuttal. Some quick background about the case. In 1994, while Sink was president of NationsBank's Florida operations, a stock broker with bank subsidiary NationsSecurities came forward with what he described as an orchestrated nationwide scheme to get bank customers to move investments from safe, federally insured accounts to more risky brokerage and mutual funds. NationsSecurities broker David Cray, who worked in Florida, said the bank intentionally blurred the lines between its traditional banking business and its securities business and misled customers into thinking those securities investments were protected by the bank or the federal government. The scheme permeated the entire bank, Cray, and later others, said. Brokers were given sales scripts to try to convince bank customers to move their money into more risky securities. NationsSecurities branch managers encouraged employees to "use fear to sell" securities. In one orientation sales meeting, a manager suggested that a broker could ask customers: "Is this your risky money or safe money? If this is risky, I know a guy at Merrill or Dean Witter." And NationsBank helped NationsSecurities by providing brokers with lists of customers who had Certificates of Deposit about to mature. The bank and stock brokers pushed the mutual funds because they received more lucrative fees, Cray said. The allegations led to a class-action lawsuit from investors who lost money by unknowingly making the risky investments, which in the end lost money. The Department of Justice and Securities and Exchange Commission also began investigations. Eventually, NationsBank and NationsSecurities settled the investigations, agreeing to pay $8.1 million to investors in 2002, paying civil fines to the federal government of $6.75 million in 2000 and $6.4 million in 2002 and $4 million to the SEC in 1998. No criminal charges were ever filed. Sink says the lawyer who started the case, Jonathan Alpert of Tampa, has said Sink had nothing to do with the scheme. Here's what Alpert told the St. Petersburg Times and Miami Herald in October when previously asked about Sink's role in selling the risky investments. "Alex Sink could've done nothing about it. It was run out of Charlotte," said Alpert, referring to NationsBank's headquarters. "I know she knew what was going on -– that investments were being sold in the bank -- but that's it. And she was powerless to stop it, anyway. I had e-mails where the state presidents were being told what to do, that they had to help the securities people. They would dig into customers bank accounts to identify people who had enough money to buy securities. "Charlotte said: 'This is what's going to happen in your bank lobbies and this is the way it's going to be.' They didn't say you're going to do A, B, C and D, they would say the bank cooperates fully with NationsSecurities," Alpert said. "If Alex Sink were involved in it, it would be a wonderful story for the gubernatorial election. But she didn't know anything about it." Alpert, who said he voted for Sink, said she no doubt knew that riskier investments were being sold in the bank, but that she was likely not aware of the way brokers were manipulating customers to close the sales. And Sink has previously told the Times she "had no authority or control" over the securities sales. "There were very, very strict firewalls between any kind of securities and brokerage operations and operations of commercial banking," she said. Those "firewalls," Sink said, were the result of the Depression-era Glass-Steagall law that separated commercial and investment banking. (The act was repealed in 1999.) But that didn't prevent Sink from finding out what was going on in her bank, noted Yale University finance expert Jonathan Macey. "She's the state bank president," he said. "She has the authority and perhaps the responsibility to know what's going on in her lobby." The original whistle-blower in the case, former NationsSecurity broker Cray, said, "I would tend not to point the finger at Alex Sink for this." Which brings us back to her statement. At the CNN/St. Petersburg Times debate Sink said that the lawyer who brought the case against NationsBank said "publicly that Alex Sink had nothing to do with the case, had nothing to do with the situation and didn't know about the problems." We think Sink is mostly quoting the lawyer in the NationsBank case, Jonathan Alpert, accurately. Alpert said Sink wasn't involved in the deceptive selling of more risky involvements through NationsSecurities and didn't know anything about the deceptive practices being employed. The companies NationsBank and NationsSecurities were managed separately. But Sink did know securities were being sold in her banks, and was in a position to voice questions or concerns about the practice if she sensed anything was being handled inappropriately. That's enough of a connection in our minds to knock this claim down one notch, and rate it Mostly True.	None	Alex Sink	None	None	None	2010-10-26T16:14:08	2010-10-25	['Alex_Sink', 'NationsBank']
pomt-00371	"It is only under President Trump that we have become the largest producer of oil and gas resources."	false	/virginia/statements/2018/sep/11/corey-stewart/corey-stewart-wrongly-says-trump-made-us-top-oil-a/	Thanks to President Donald Trump, Corey Stewart says, the United States is leading the world in oil and gas production. Stewart, Virginia’s Republican nominee for the U.S. Senate, made that claim twice during a July 21 debate with Democrat incumbent Tim Kaine. Stewart — a Trump loyalist — was portraying Kaine as a constant opponent of the president programs, including energy policy. "Because of President Trump, the United States is - now get this - the largest combined supplier of oil and gas resources on the planet," Stewart said. Stewart repeated the claim three minutes later. "It is only because of President Trump that we have become the largest producer of gas and oil resources," he said. We investigated Stewart’s statements. The U.S. is the world’s largest combined producer of gas and oil. The question is whether that happened during Trump’s presidency, which began Jan. 20, 2017. The answer is no. Stewart’s campaign didn’t respond to three requests for proof of Stewart’s claim. So we turned to research from the U.S. Energy Information Administration, which compiles data of global energy production and consumption. Figures and charts in an EIA report this spring show that the U.S. overtook Russia as the world’s largest gas and oil producer in 2011 - when Barack Obama was president. The U.S. produced 43.92 quadrillion British thermal units of gas and oil a day that year (roughly equivalent to 22 million barrels), compared to Russia’s daily rate of 43.85 quadrillion Btu. Saudi Arabia was a distant third, producing 26.5 quadrillion Btu daily. Since then, the U.S. has steadily expanded its lead. In 2017 - the first year of Trump’s presidency - the U.S. produced 59.4 quadrillion Btu of oil and gas daily, compared to Russia’s rate of 46.4 quadrillion Btu a day. Saudi Arabia again ranked third, at 28.7 quadrillion Btu. The EIA and other energy experts attribute the growth in U.S. production to a surge in extracting oil and gas from shale by hydraulic fracturing, or fracking. The process involves using water pressure to fracture rocks and release their natural gas and oil. The U.S. is the world leader in shale gas production. Shale production has made the U.S. the "undisputed global oil and gas leader," Fatih Birol, executive director of the International Energy Agency, which advises 30 nations, told a U.S. Senate committee in January 2018. He said the U.S. should keep that that status for years to come. The U.S. overtook Russia in 2009 to become the world’s largest gas producer. It passed Saudi Arabia in 2013 to become the leading oil producer. Our ruling Stewart said, "It is only under President Trump that we have become the largest producer of oil and gas resources." His campaign didn’t respond to three requests for proof. EIA data shows that U.S. has been the world leader in gas production since 2009, oil production since 2013, and combined gas and oil production since 2011. All of this happened well before Trump came to White House. We rate Stewart’s statement False. Correction: An earlier version of this fact check mispelled the first name of Fatih Birol.

pomt-05249	Says the Affordable Care Act was a federal takeover of the student loan industry and ‘profits’ on the loans go to help pay for the health care law.	mostly false	/new-hampshire/statements/2012/jun/01/kelly-ayotte/kelly-ayotte-claims-student-loan-change-government/	College loans and universal health care might not seem to be related, but U.S. Sen. Kelly Ayotte, R-NH, says there is an unusual linkage. Ayotte tied the two issues together last month in a May 8, 2012, email that her office sent to the press titled, "We Can Prevent a Student Loan Rate Increase Without Raising Taxes." The message, meant to convey Ayotte’s stance on temporarily extending existing rates on new subsidized Stafford loans, raised some questions about where student loan interest is going, and whether government "profits" from those loans are used to help pay for the health care law. "Under the Affordable Care Act, which amounted to a federal takeover of the student loan industry, the government borrows money at 2.8 percent and then loans money to students at 6.8 percent. Government profits are then used to help pay for the health care law," Ayotte asserted. PolitiFact Ohio has already laid out how the federal government is using student loans to pay for some health care reforms when it fact-checked a claim made by Sen. Rob Portman. Through the Reconciliation Act of 2012, which combined student loans and health care in one bill, Congress removed the private sector from the student loan process, to eliminate federal payments to banks and to move the revenue from the lending process into federal coffers. The savings was expected to be about $58 billion over 10 years, according to the Congressional Budget Office, with $39 billion going back into student loan programs, $10 billion toward deficit reduction and $9 billion directed toward health care. Yet, Ayotte’s email took Portman’s logic a step further, claiming a government takeover of the student loan industry and using profits to pay for Obamacare. PolitiFact has given plenty of Pants on Fire ratings to claims that say Obama’s health care law is a federal takeover of the health care system -- it was PolitiFact's Lie of the Year for 2010. But a takeover of the student loan industry? That’s a new one. First we contacted Ayotte’s legislative office to get sources for the claim. They cited PolitiFact Ohio’s Half True ruling on Portman’s claim as back up for Ayotte’s statement. But that only dealt with a portion of what Ayotte was saying. PolitiFact Ohio walked through the history of government involvement with student loans, up to the Reconciliation Act of 2010, which permanently moved the government away from subsidizing private lenders for student loans as had been the practice since 1965. With the Federal Family Education Loan (FFEL) program, created with the Higher Education Act of 1965, the federal government guaranteed student loans against default by promising a certain interest rate to the banks, even if the rates students paid were lower. In other words, the government money has always been behind the loans to American students. "(The Reconciliation Act of 2010) didn’t take over the student loan industry, it ended a federal program," said Jason Delisle, Director of the Federal Education Budget Project at the New America Foundation. "The semantic problem of the government taking over its own program is really kind of crazy." "You wouldn’t talk about the government taking over the Social Security program, or a government takeover of Medicare," Delisle said. "It didn’t take over the industry. The private companies that were involved were participating in a federal program and were getting paid for that. So how do you get ‘federal takeover’ out of that?" Through the FFEL program, the government paid additional fees to banks for administration and collection of student loans, providing them a revenue stream. While millions of Americans earned college degrees, the system required billions of dollars in federal subsidies, and some in Washington, especially Democrats, sought alternatives, which ultimately prompted The Reconciliation Act of 2010. When we asked Ayotte’s office to address the "federal takeover" of student loans, they pointed to the CBO break down of the Reconciliation Act that explains the reconciliation package would eliminate the federal guaranteed loan program and replace it with direct loans administered by the Department of Education and funded through the U.S. Treasury. Because the government has always backstopped student loans, calling the Reconciliation Act of 2010 a "federal takeover" isn’t accurate, said Justine Sessions, a spokeswoman for the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Pensions and Labor, which is chaired by Democrat Tom Harkin. "What the health care reconciliation package did was eliminate the middleman," Sessions said. "The middleman equals a bunch of private banks." In addition, many of the same companies involved in the guaranteed loan program service the expanded direct loan program, Delisle added. They include nonprofit and for-profit companies, including Sallie Mae, Nel Net, Mohela, Granite State Management and Resources, among others. "The federal government can’t do all this work itself," Delisle said. "(The guaranteed loan program) wasn’t really a private sector thing. What’s really important to understand about that is the government set all of the terms on the loans, the interest rates, the terms of repayment, all of that was set in law and the loan companies couldn’t change those." And private lenders can still make loans to students, Delisle added. "They can do it, they just don’t get any subsidies from the government," Delisle said. "They don’t do it because it’s a money loser." As for the rates Ayotte’s staff provided, those were accurate, Delisle said, but to call the interest the government gains on the loans "profits," is a stretch. "Banks can borrow at the same rate as the federal government," Delisle said. "They don’t make money off lending to students at 6.8 percent. … This concept that the difference between the rate the government charges on the loan and the rate they pay to borrow is profit, is totally wrong." Subsidized loans do not make money for the government, Sessions said. They actually cost the federal government money. "The claim seems to conflate two completely unrelated issues," Sessions said. "The 6.8 percent interest rate was set by Congress in 2002 with overwhelming bipartisan support and it was the projected average rate that would result in 2006 under a fixed rate formula." Loans had the same interest rates under both the direct loan and FFEL programs, Sessions said, and the cost of student loans to the government fluctuates with program changes, economic conditions, borrower repayment patterns, and the relationship between the government’s borrowing rate and the interest rate at which borrowers repay loans. There’s also more to the cost of the loan than what the government pays to borrow, Delisle added, including losses from defaults, administrative costs, cost of equity, loan forgiveness, and risk. Current fixed rates do not offset those additional costs. "The bottom line is that the claim about the 2010 legislation that cut out the middleman in the student loan system is completely unrelated to the claim about what government charges for student loans," Sessions said. "Reinstating the FFEL program would cost the government additional fees and subsidies that would be paid to banks." Our ruling The government’s Reconciliation Act of 2010 was not a takeover, but rather an elimination of a federal student loan program the government had used since 1965. Private companies are still involved in servicing the program and private lenders can still make their own student loans without a government subsidy. The government does borrow in the 2.8 percent ballpark and loans money to students at 6.8 percent but the difference is not a profit, it helps compensate for the unanticipated losses inherent with any loan. Finally, the money saved in the Reconciliation Act of 2010, not "profits" from the direct loans, is used to fund elements of the Affordable Care Act. Since Ayotte’s statements have elements of truth but lack critical facts, we give her a Mostly False. UPDATE: This item has been updated to note that Justine Sessions is a spokeswoman for the Democrat-controlled Senate Committee on Health, Education, Pensions and Labor. Also, we have corrected a quotation from Jason Delisle who said he mistakenly said the government does not "make money off lending to students at 2.8 percent," when he meant to say 6.8.

pomt-08655	On whether President Obama's speeches to school children spread "socialist ideology."	full flop	/florida/statements/2010/sep/14/jim-greer/former-florida-gop-chair-apologizes-obama-educatio/	A year ago, we fact-checked a statement from the Republican Party of Florida that claimed President Barack Obama intended to indoctrinate school children with socialist ideology. The alleged vehicle: a back-to-school speech given to the nation's students. Some of Obama's other political opponents echoed the charge, and principals across the country had to answer questions from parents about whether students were required to watch the speech. This year, Obama gave a speech to schoolchildren on Sept. 14, 2010, with little controversy. Like last year, he spoke of the necessity of hard work and a good education. But we were surprised by a dramatic change of position for Jim Greer, the former head of the Republican Party of Florida. Here's his statement from last year: "As the father of four children, I am absolutely appalled that taxpayer dollars are being used to spread President Obama's socialist ideology. The idea that school children across our nation will be forced to watch the president justify his plans for government-run health care, banks and automobile companies, increasing taxes on those who create jobs, and racking up more debt than any other president, is not only infuriating, but goes against beliefs of the majority of Americans, while bypassing American parents through an invasive abuse of power." We fact-checked that at the time and rated it Pants on Fire. We found no evidence that Obama intended to address school children on public policy matters, much less socialism. All evidence pointed to a more generic speech on the importance of education, and that's what Obama delivered. Greer's position has entirely changed since then, and in more ways than one. Greer lost his party chairmanship in January 2010, and state authorities arrested him in June on corruption charges, alleging that he used a secret contract to send party donations to a consulting firm he owned. Greer now faces six felony charges, including fraud and money laundering. (PolitiFact Florida has detailed a timeline on Greer's departure from the state party.) Meanwhile, Gov. Charlie Crist -- who picked Greer as party chairman after Crist became governor in 2006 -- left the Republican Party in April to run as an independent for U.S. Senate. The party supports Marco Rubio, a former state legislator and speaker of the House, in that race. This year, to mark Obama's speech to students, Greer sent the following text message to Florida reporters: "In the year since I issued a prepared statement regarding President Obama speaking to the nation’s school children, I have learned a great deal about the party I so deeply loved and served. Unfortunately, I found that many within the GOP have racist views and I apologize to the president for my opposition to his speech last year and my efforts to placate the extremists who dominate our party today. My children and I look forward to the president's speech." We called the Republican Party of Florida and asked them about Greer's statement, but they declined to comment. That could be because Greer earlier this year filed a lawsuit against the party for failing to pay him severance of $124,000, plus health care. Just this past weekend, party officials said they were contemplating their own lawsuit against Greer and Crist for misspending party funds. So Greer is no longer head of the party and repudiates his own statements from a year ago. Could Greer's new view on Obama's school speech be just another stick-in-the-eye to the people who kicked him out of his job? Sure. Greer sent a letter to Crist last month asking for his campaign contributions back, because Greer said he needs the money to defend himself. In the letter, he blasted state party leaders, some by name, saying they "are simply liars, racists, and extremists ... the current bunch that are running the show will stop at nothing to cover for their own misdeeds." Whatever Greer's motivations, we very seldom see such a thorough change of position on over-the-top political rhetoric, much less an apology. To note that dramatic reversal, we put Greer on the Flip-O-Meter and rate his statement a Full Flop.	None	Jim Greer	None	None	None	2010-09-14T17:36:11	2010-09-14	['Barack_Obama']
pomt-12584	"There is no legal basis" for Donald Trump's "missile strike against Syrian military assets."	false	/wisconsin/statements/2017/apr/07/mark-pocan/mark-pocan-wrongly-claims-donald-trump-had-no-lega/	The morning after the U.S. cruise missiles assault on a Syrian air base, U.S. Rep. Mark Pocan questioned the legal authority of President Donald Trump to order the attack. "There is no legal basis for last night’s missile strike against Syrian military assets," the Madison-area Democrat declared in a statement on April 7, 2017. "Congress must be called back immediately, if President Trump plans to escalate our military involvement. He must send a new Authorization for Use of Military Force (AUMF) to Congress, as I have previously called for." The 59-missile assault was launched in retaliation for a chemical weapons attack by the government against Syrian civilians two days earlier. News reports quoted U.S. officials as saying Trump had the right to use force to defend national interests and to protect civilians from atrocities. Meanwhile, first-term U.S. Rep. Mike Gallagher, R-Green Bay, while praising the "limited strikes," also said Trump "should seek congressional authorization for any sustained military operation in Syria." There’s certainly debate over the extent of a president’s authority to use military force without approval from Congress. But Pocan went too far in saying there is no legal basis for Trump’s action. Competing arguments To support Pocan’s claim, his office noted the U.S. Constitution assigns to Congress the power to declare war, and sent us commentary on that provision and the missile attack by the American Civil Liberties Union. The ACLU reiterated its position that "the decision to use military force requires Congress’ specific, advance authorization." Pocan also cited the War Powers Resolution of 1973, which was enacted over a veto by Republican President Richard Nixon. It says "the introduction of United States Armed Forces into hostilities" can be done only "pursuant to a declaration of war, specific statutory authorization, or a national emergency created by attack upon the United States, its territories or possessions, or its armed forces." And Harvard law professor Jack Goldsmith, an assistant attorney general under Republican President George W. Bush, argued in 2013 that Democratic President Barack Obama didn’t have unilateral authority to launch attacks against Syria, as was being considered at the time. Goldsmith said the president’s authority to use force without congressional approval had been extended to protect American persons and property abroad, but that rationale would not have applied to the attacks Obama contemplated (but never carried out). The Trump administration, meanwhile, also invokes the Constitution (Article 2) in asserting that the president has the power to defend the U.S. national interest. In this case, that interest is described as "promoting regional stability, which the use of chemical weapons threatens" -- which the Trump administration likened to the Obama administration’s justification for using force in Libya in 2011. Other views Experts agree that in limited instances, such as the Syrian missile attack, a president has legal authority provided in the Constitution as commander-in chief. Cameron University history and government professor Lance Janda said he agrees with Pocan’s call for a new congressional authorization for use of force, adding: "We have not declared war on anyone since 1941, and yet we are the most active nation state on the planet when it comes to military action." But "having said that," Janda continued, the Constitution gives the president authority as commander in chief to use force to protect our national interests and War Powers Resolution gives the president "leeway to respond to attacks or other emergencies." McGill University professor of international relations Mark Brawley also said the president has authority to use military force in a crisis, but then should notify Congress within 48 hours. The president also should ask Congress for authority to use military force if there will be extended conflict, or for a declaration of war, if the United States will be at war with Syria, he said. Like the Trump administration, Georgetown University professor Anthony Arend, whose specialties include international relations and constitutional law of U.S. foreign relations, also cited Article 2 of the Constitution and the president’s power as commander-in-chief. He told us: "While the precise scope of this power is unclear, a strong argument can be made that the president can use force in short military operations -- especially where there is minimal risk to American lives -- without congressional authorization. Indeed, over the years, Congress has generally acquiesced in such presidential uses of force. "Because the air strikes were undertaken by cruise missiles that put virtually no American lives at risk and because the strikes lasted only minutes, the president's action would seem to be a lawful use of force under the Constitution. Needless to say, if further military actions were to be undertaken, they could rise to the level of requiring congressional authorization." Added Richard Stoll, an international conflict scholar at Rice University, about the Trump attack: "This is not new." Stoll said he would advise a president to get congressional approval before taking additional action, but presidents many times have taken a "one-off" action such as the Syrian attack. Those views correspond to a 2013 fact check of then-U.S. Sen. Joe Lieberman, who said Obama would have had the legal authority to strike Syria without a vote from Congress. PolitiFact National’s rating was True. As our colleagues reported: Since the last time Congress declared war, at the beginning of World War II, presidents have generally initiated military activities using their constitutionally granted powers as commander in chief without having an official declaration of war in support of their actions. Even under the War Powers Resolution, the president can send in forces without approval from Congress. Lower courts have ruled in favor of the White House in the use of force, and the U.S. Supreme Court declined to hear an appeal on that point. Our rating Pocan said: "There is no legal basis" for Trump's "missile strike against Syrian military assets." For limited military activities like the missile strike, presidents can send in forces without approval from Congress. We rate Pocan’s statement False.

Look in (the) political season. Millions of dollars, millions of dollars are spent by Planned Parenthood to elect Democrats to the House of Representatives and to the Senate. This isn’t about babies; this is about money." A reader asked us to check Duffy’s claim. The videos, the funding The videos, first released in July 2015, show Planned Parenthood officials offhandedly discussing how they sometimes procure tissue from aborted fetuses for medical research. The anti-abortion Center for Medical Progress, which recorded the videos, alleges Planned Parenthood is illegally profiting from fetal organ sales. But Planned Parenthood says it has done nothing illegal, and that the videos were edited in a misleading way. The defunding bill, which has yet to be taken up by the U.S. Senate, would end federal payments to Planned Parenthood for a year, diverting the money to thousands of community health centers. Republicans say those clinics could handle the displaced Planned Parenthood patients, but Democrats say the centers are overburdened and sometimes in remote locations. Planned Parenthood gets around $450 million each year in federal payments, mostly Medicaid reimbursements for handling low-income patients. That's around one-third of the organization's $1.3 billion annual budget. As for Planned Parenthood’s political activity, some of this ground was covered when Republican presidential candidate Carly Fiorina made a similar claim. She said Planned Parenthood "funnels millions of dollars in political contributions to pro-abortion candidates." PolitiFact National rated the statement Mostly True. Millions have been spent. But the caveat is that the operational, medical clinics of Planned Parenthood cannot spend money in politics -- separate entities that are affiliated with Planned Parenthood can. Duffy’s claim Duffy’s claim was a little different -- that Planned Parenthood spent millions to elect Democrats to the House and Senate. We found, using figures from the nonpartisan Center for Responsive Politics, that that was this case. In the 2014 election cycle alone, Planned Parenthood-affiliated groups that can't give directly to candidates or coordinate with them, such as Planned Parenthood Votes, a Super PAC, made over $6 million in independent expenditures. That included $1.85 million spent in support of Democrats and $2.87 million spent against Republicans. "In addition, Planned Parenthood's PAC gave nearly $590,000 to congressional candidates, all of them Democrats." The numbers would be higher, of course, if previous cycles were included. Our rating Duffy said: "Millions of dollars are spent by Planned Parenthood to elect Democrats to the House of Representatives and the Senate." By law, the operational, medical clinics of Planned Parenthood cannot spend money in politics. But separate entities that are affiliated with Planned Parenthood can, and they spent millions just in the 2014 election cycle to elect Democrats. We rate Duffy’s statement Mostly True.

pomt-15249	"In 1947, when I was born, there were about 450,000 lions. In the mid-70s, when my kids were born, there were about 100,000. Today, there are less than 30,000."	mostly true	/punditfact/statements/2015/aug/03/jack-hanna/jack-hanna-talks-cecil-week-claims-africas-lion-po/	As experts debate legal consequences for the Minnesota dentist who killed well-known Zimbabwean lion Cecil, conservationists and animal rights activists are using the opportunity to highlight threats to the long-term viability of lions in the wild. Animal expert and television personality Jack Hanna, who is also the director emeritus of the Columbus Zoo and Aquarium, emphasized how quickly the lion population has decreased within his lifetime on ABC's This Week. "In 1947, when I was born, there were about 450,000 lions," Hanna said in the Aug. 2 interview. "In the mid-'70s, when my kids were born, there were about 100,000. Today, there are less than 30,000." We wondered if Hanna’s claim about the lion population was true. Has the population really shrunk by more than 90 percent in 68 years, and if so, why? When it comes to counting lions, accurate numbers are almost as elusive as the animals themselves. 1940s Most scientists and researchers agree that the number of lions in the wild is in decline. The Switzerland-based International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) lists the species as "vulnerable" on its threat scale, just one level below "endangered." It’s the speed of the decline that is in dispute. A spokesperson for Hanna said he was citing loose figures from the National Geographic Society’s Big Cats Initiative. The organization’s page on lions estimates that there were around 450,000 African lions in the 1940s, 100,000 in the 1980s, and 20,000 today — almost exactly mirroring what Hanna said. Other research questions some of Hanna's figures. He claimed more than 450,000 lions roamed the savannahs in the 1940s, but detailed studies of the population weren’t conducted back then. That means data for that period is virtually nonexistent. Susie Weller, a spokeswoman for Panthera, another big cats advocacy group, cited her organization’s own estimate that there were already as few as 200,000 "over a century ago." In other words, no one really knows how many lions there were in the 1940s. "You might even see numbers in the millions," said Stuart Pimm, a professor of conservation ecology at Duke University and a contributor to the Big Cats Initiative. 1970s Hanna then claimed there were 100,000 lions in the wild during the 1970s. No empirical data exists for that time either, not that scientists haven't tried to make a best guess. In 1996, a team of researchers employed land-use data to predict there were around 75,800 lions in 1980. The study, which was not published, is widely cited and was conducted at Cranfield University’s International Eco Technology Research Centre in the United Kingdom. Pimm said that this strategy was one of the more reliable ways to estimate the size of the population. "What we can consider," he said, "is how much lion habitat there was back then, and then approximate how many lions fit into that area. But if you’re going to put a number on it, you have to be careful to couch it in very, very approximate terms." The geographic analysis is the closest anyone has come to a population count for that time, and it’s a rough guess at best. Jason Riggio, a doctoral candidate at the University of California, Davis and the author of a study on lion populations, said the 1980 number "arguably should not be cited as fact" because it doesn’t take into account expert opinions or survey data. Hanna’s claim that there were 100,000 lions left in the 1970s isn’t far off from the closest estimate for that decade, yet isn’t based on any convincing data. Today Hanna was more on target when he said there "are less than 30,000" lions left in the wild today. A widely used figure for the present population comes from the 2012 study led by Riggio. The paper, which combines data from two counts in the early 2000s, puts the population "between 32,000 and 35,000." Other organizations cited the IUCN's Red List of Threatened Species as an authoritative source for species population numbers and trends. The Red List questions Riggio’s numbers, arguing that, among other issues, his team’s use of older figures ignored downward trends that may have taken place in some regions. "We have greater confidence in the estimate of fewer than 20,000 lions in Africa than in a number over 30,000," reads the group’s file on lions. Still, Hanna’s claim that there are fewer than 30,000 lions left in the wild today is within the range of these two estimates. Lions, Pimm said said, stake out in some of the most unforgiving natural habitats in the world, making them hard to locate, spot and count. "There are roughly 30,000 lions in Africa," said Pimm, "and they’re spread out over a massive area. People just don’t realize how big the continent really is." Some researchers in the field, including Riggio, are reluctant to mention specific numbers for the changing lion population given the problematic data. But the experts agreed that Hanna's general point about a massive decline in the species is accurate. The threat lions pose to farms means that "they are persecuted intensely in livestock areas across Africa," according to the IUCN, and growth in the bushmeat market has led to a decrease in the abundance of their prey. While hunters claim that trophy hunting in small numbers is a valuable way to finance conservation, the IUCN has reported an unsustainable number of kills in regions across the continent. Our ruling Hanna said, "In 1947, when I was born, there were about 450,000 lions. In the mid-'70s, when my kids were born, there were about 100,000. Today, there are less than 30,000." Counting lions in the wild is extremely difficult and requires a lot of estimation. Any hard numbers, therefore, should be taken with a grain of salt. Hanna’s claim reflects the consensus among researchers that lion numbers are in decline. The exact figures are up for some deabte, but his point is certainly valid. We rate it Mostly True.

pomt-01074	"Over half the people on disability are either anxious or their back hurts."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/jan/16/rand-paul/rand-paul-says-most-people-receive-disability-back/	Turning 40? Sen. Rand Paul says you can look forward to back pain in your near future, and maybe some anxiety. But don’t try to turn your ailments into a government check. At a breakfast event Wednesday, Jan. 14 in New Hampshire, the Kentucky Republican and potential presidential candidate spoke out against a public safety net that catches too many people who don’t need help. "The thing is, all of these programs, there’s always somebody who’s deserving. (But) everybody in this room knows somebody who is gaming the system," Paul said. The proof? Look no further than the diagnoses landing people on disability, he added. "Over half the people on disability are either anxious or their back hurts. Join the club," he said to laughter. "Who doesn’t get up a little anxious for work every day and their back hurts? Everybody over 40 has a little back pain." Paul may be having a little fun about the aches and pains of growing older, but his comment raises serious questions about a program relied on by millions of people. Is the majority of the disability population suffering from back pain and anxiety? We decided to check the numbers. Identifying the problem The Social Security Administration has provided benefits to people with disabilities since President Dwight Eisenhower signed legislation in 1956. The program is intended to provide cash assistance to people who are disabled for a year or longer and cannot work or can only work menial jobs for little pay (about $1,000 a month). The number of individuals receiving disability has been on an upward trajectory for decades. In 1970, there were less than 2 million beneficiaries; now, the program has surpassed 10 million, far outpacing U.S. population growth. Nearly two-thirds of people on disability are 50 or older. The large growth in the program has sparked claims of waste, fraud and abuse. And indeed, several reports from the Government Accountability Office have found problems with the program, as Paul’s office pointed out. After an audit of disability insurance in 2013, the Government Accountability Office estimated that in fiscal year 2011, the Social Security Administration made $1.29 billion in potential cash benefit overpayments to about 36,000 individuals who were working and making more than $1,100 a month (the limit to receive disability benefits). The 36,000 people receiving improper payments, while a lot on paper, represent about 0.4 percent of all beneficiaries, the report said. There are other ways Social Security gives out benefits to those not deserving, but paying people already working is about 72 percent of the problem, according to the Social Security Administration. Factoring that in, the GAO estimates overpayments equaled $1.62 billion, or 1.27 percent of all disability benefits, in 2011. It’s a lot of money, but the disability program is a $128 billion program. The Government Accountability Office goes on to say the exact number of improper payments is unknown. It could be higher. Additionally, another GAO report warned the Social Security Administration’s efforts to thwart potential physician-assisted fraud are "hampered by a lack of planning, data, and coordination." Back and anxiety Let’s narrow in on Paul’s specific claim: "Over half the people on disability are either anxious or their back hurts." This is not rooted in the official numbers. Social Security does not group people by back pain or anxiety in any of their published reports. Instead, they track a much broader list of physical and mental ailments. What would back pain or anxiety fall under? Most back problems would fall under the category "diseases of the musculoskeletal system and connective tissue," the most common ailment. In 2013, 27.7 percent of all people received benefits for these types of ailments. If you look at just workers, it was 30.5 percent. There's also another category, "injuries," that might include some back problems. Those affect another 4 percent of workers. But not all musculoskeletal system and connective tissue diseases are back problems. Far from it. They include ailments ranging from a broken bone and bad burns to amputated limbs and deformities. Anxiety would be included in "mental disorders." That category is broken down further as follows: Mental disorder Percent of all workers on disability Autistic disorder 0.2 Developmental disorders 0.1 Childhood and adolescent disorders not otherwise clasified 0.1 Intellectual disability 4.1 Mood disorders 14.9 Organic mental disorders 3.4 Schizophrenic and other psychotic 4.8 Other 3.9 Total 31.5 As you can see, it's a pretty confusing list, and it's not immediately clear which category certain mental ailments would fall into. If by "anxious," Paul meant a catchall term for all mental disorders, then, sure, about one-third of all disabled workers have some sort of mental issue. Paul's spokesman singled out the subcategory "mood disorders" when explaining how Paul reached his conclusion. Other media outlets have similarly placed anxiety under this heading. However, the Social Security Administration told us that category typically includes affective disorders like depression, not anxiety disorders. Instead, people suffering from "anxiety disorders" -- which include things like post-traumatic stress disorder and obsessive-compulsive disorder -- are included in the "other" category. That category also includes diseases like Tourette syndrome and affects far fewer people than mood disorders, about 3.9 percent. For the sake of argument, let's follow Paul's faulty logic. Even assuming generously that every single person with a musculoskeletal system problem came in with "back pain," and every person with a "mood disorder" had anxiety, it still only equals 45.4 percent, less than half. Throw in "other" mental disorders, you're still just below 50 percent. If you categorize anxiety correctly as "other" and add it to all musculoskeletal system problems, you would end up far lower, at 34 percent. And again, not every person with a musculoskeletal problem has a back problem, and not every person with a mental disorder has anxiety. For Paul to imply as much is either stretching reality or downplaying serious ailments. There has been an increase in the number of people receiving disability for musculoskeletal system and mental problems. In 1961, the most common ailment for new beneficiaries was heart disease or stroke. Meanwhile, 8 percent of those going on disability received assistance for musculoskeletal system issues. That’s an interesting and notable statistic, and one worth exploring. NPR published a very extensive report suggesting some older, unskilled workers are going on disability (many with back issues) because the only jobs available to them are physically strenuous. But that doesn’t wash away Paul’s mischaracterization of the ailments nor his inflation of the numbers. Our ruling Paul said, "Over half the people on disability are either anxious or their back hurts." The numbers don’t add up. The two broader disability categories that include back pain ("diseases of the musculoskeletal system") and anxiety disorders ("mental disorders - other") don’t even equal close to 50 percent, let alone those two ailments by themselves. Paul’s quip might make for a good soundbite, but it’s not rooted in reality. We rate the statement False.	None	Rand Paul	None	None	None	2015-01-16T16:23:11	2015-01-14	['None']
pomt-15179	Says "56 percent of (the U.S.-Mexico) border is not under our control."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/aug/23/ben-carson/ben-carson-most-border-not-under-our-control/	Republican presidential candidate Ben Carson suggested drones could really help the country’s overstressed border patrol. Carson told CNN’s Jim Acosta on State of the Union on Aug. 23, 2015, that the drones could be used for more than just surveillance along the Mexican border, potentially taking out caves that smugglers and cartels use to cross into the United States. "We're not getting support from the federal government to deal with these people," he said. "They're being outgunned. Fifty-six percent of that border is not under our control." There was a bit of overlap between Acosta and Carson (this transcript quotes Carson saying 66 percent), but we heard 56 percent. We wondered if Carson was correct that more than half of our southern border was "not under our control." We didn’t hear back from Carson’s campaign when we tried to contact them for the source of the retired neurosurgeon’s figure. But we have an idea where he may have gotten it. A 2011 Government Accountability Office report said U.S. Customs and Border Protection considered 873 miles of the almost 2,000-mile U.S. border with Mexico under "operational control" in fiscal year 2010. Those are areas they classified "as those in which it has the ability to detect, respond, and interdict illegal activity at the border or after entry into the United States." Operational control was broken down into two definitions: "Controlled" areas had enough agents to either deter or detect and apprehend illegal entries immediately at the border. We must note this still doesn’t mean a 100 percent apprehension rate, but controlled status accounted for 129 miles, or about 15 percent of those 873 miles under operational control. The other 85 percent were considered "managed" areas, where agents could still identify and apprehend most entries from as far as 100 miles away. The other 1,120 miles of border — the 56 percent of the total border to which Carson is likely referring — fell under two other definitions. The report said nearly two-thirds was considered "monitored," meaning illegal entries were likely to be detected, but resources or accessibility could make responses difficult. The other third was labeled "low-level monitored," defined as regions where detection and interdiction were constrained by few resources or poor infrastructure. "Border Patrol reported that these two levels of control were not acceptable for border security," the GAO report said. So does that mean they aren’t under control, as Carson said? Experts have told us before that there’s no set definition for a secure border, and it’s not fair to set the standard as a 100 percent border-crosser apprehension rate because then no part of the border would qualify. Border Patrol agents are charged with many duties beyond stopping illegal immigration. They are supposed to catch drug smugglers, weapons traffickers, potential terrorists, money launderers and more. Apprehensions only tell part of the story. Because no one knows how many crossing attempts there truly are each year, by any group targeted by the border patrol, there’s no way to really set a universal metric for security. The 2011 GAO report said the Department of Homeland Security was replacing its border security measures, and it expected data reported to Congress to wane as programs were updated through 2012. A January 2015 report by now retired Sen. Tom Coburn, R-Okla., said that as of 2014, more than 700 miles of the southern border "were not secure." The report blamed "little to no deployment density or aviation surveillance coverage." The oversight report blamed the problems in part to a lack of overall border security plan by the Department of Homeland Security. But Coburn’s report also said that "it is impossible to judge whether the border is secure" based on available data. There’s no way to tell just how many crossings went undetected, the report said, and changes in apprehensions and economic and social factors in immigration made extrapolating overall security very difficult. As far as reported statistics, we know that illegal migration through the border has decreased in recent years. The Bipartisan Policy Center said that in 2007, there were 1.6 million instances of people apprehended, turned back at the border or evidence of people making it across, known as "gotaways." The center said that number had dropped to 741,881 in 2013. There also is evidence the number of native Mexicans living in the U.S. is leveling, experts have said, and eight of the nine sectors the border is broken into by the Border Patrol had higher effectiveness ratings in 2013 than they did in 2006. Christopher Wilson, deputy director of the Mexico Institute at the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars, gives Carson credit for using the term "control," since that’s the word the border patrol used in part to measure its own effectiveness. But as a practical matter, it’s impossible to stop everyone from crossing the border, he said. That makes it difficult to settle on how much enforcement would be required for everyone to consider it "enough." Wilson added things have indeed improved, no matter which source you cite. "All the different measures point to an overall improvement in border security over at least the last 10 years," Wilson said. "We don’t know what a secure border is, because we’ve never defined it as a society." Our ruling Carson said that "56 percent of that (U.S.-Mexico) border is not under our control." U.S. Customs and Border Protection said in a 2011 report that 873 miles of the U.S. Mexico border was under "operational control." The other 1,120 miles, or about 56 percent, fell under two classifications "not acceptable for border security." That doesn’t mean there is an utter lack of control, but that the agency’s ability to detect or respond (or both) to crossings was hampered by a lack of resources or infrastructure. Carson did not specify what he meant by control, and experts have told us security is a subjective metric. It doesn’t appear he pulled the number out of thin air, but available data does show that illegal crossings along the border have overall been on the decline. We rate Carson’s statement Half True.

pomt-00737	"We have an 80 percent graduation rate in high school after spending more per student than any country in the world other than Liechtenstein, I think, or Luxembourg and a couple other small countries."	true	/florida/statements/2015/apr/21/jeb-bush/does-united-states-spend-more-student-most-countri/	While some conservative activists and presidential hopefuls have trashed Common Core, former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush remains a supporter of the education standards. Bush’s support for Common Core could put him at odds with primary challengers should he decide to enter the race: Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Florida, opposes Common Core, while Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker, a potential candidate, once showed tacit support but later called for repeal. During an event on April 17 in New Hampshire, a Nashua resident asked Bush straight up: "Gov. Bush: where do you stand on Common Core?" Bush said: "Thank you for bringing that up. If it wasn’t going to be brought up, I was going to bring it up myself." Bush then made his case that Common Core is essentially a push for higher standards, to address concerns about student achievement in the United States. "We have an 80 percent graduation rate in high school after spending more per student than any country in the world other than Liechtenstein I think, or Luxembourg and a couple other small countries," Bush said. Bush drew applause when he said "we don’t need a federal government involved in this at all," and added that he supported proposed legislation to ban the feds from creating standards or curriculum. (PolitiFact has rated multiple claims from other politicians that Common Core is a "federal takeover" of education and found them misleading.) Here we will fact-check Bush’s claim about the national graduation rate and how much we spend per student compared to other countries. Graduation rates and per-pupil spending There are a few different ways to measure graduation rates including the federal government's cohort method, which examines how many students who enter 9th grade graduate four years later with a standard diploma. By that measurement, the national average was about 81 percent in 2012-13. (Florida is below that national average.) As for spending, Bush’s spokeswoman pointed to a 2013 Associated Press article about a study by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development that compared per-pupil spending among 34 advanced industrialized nations. Formed in 1961, OECD sets international standards on a wide range of topics, including education spending. The most recent OECD study -- from 2014 using 2011 data -- shows that the United States spends $12,731 per student on secondary education. Four countries -- Austria, Luxembourg, Norway and Switzerland -- spend more. Those same countries are also the only ones that spend more than the United States per student on primary schools. Country Secondary per-pupil spending Austria $13,607 Luxembourg $16,182 Norway $13,939 Switzerland $15,891 United States $12,731 (Bush mentioned Liechtenstein, a tiny country located between Austria and Switzerland, but that wasn’t included on the OECD list.) Pointing to the OECD data, the federal government’s National Center for Education Statistics notes that a country’s wealth is positively associated with expenditures per student. When examining expenditures as a percentage of gross domestic product for all levels of education, the United States and Chile are seventh out of 32 countries. Stanford professor Eric Hanushek, an expert on economic analysis of educational issues, told PolitiFact that the OECD ranking is the best source currently available to judge differences among nations in education. However, University of Iowa education professor David Bills offered one caveat. "What matters is not the absolute budget per se, but the proportion of that budget that is spent on instruction," Bills said. Traditionally the United States spends big parts of its educational budget on non-instructional items such as security -- more so than some other nations. Bush has changed how he has worded his claim about how per-student spending in the United States compares to other countries. In 2013, Bush claimed that the United States spends "more per student than any country in the world," which Factcheck.org noted was inaccurate since a few countries spent more. Our ruling Bush said, "We have an 80 percent graduation rate in high school after spending more per student than any country in the world other than Liechtenstein, I think, or Luxembourg and a couple other small countries." The national average for the graduation rate was 81 percent in 2012-13, according to one method the federal government uses to calculate the rate. Among advanced countries, the United States ranked fifth in per student spending for secondary education behind Austria, Luxembourg, Norway and Switzerland. Liechtenstein wasn’t on the list, but since Bush expressed uncertainty, we think his statement is still accurate. We rate this claim True.

pomt-00887	The University of Wisconsin System "will be much more affordable than just about any other campus in America" because "going forward we have a cap on it tied to inflation."	false	/wisconsin/statements/2015/mar/09/scott-walker/scott-walker-uw-tuition-will-be-lower-just-about-a/	As Gov. Scott Walker’s presidential star continued to rise, Chris Wallace, host of Fox News Sunday, challenged him on how his budget treats the University of Wisconsin System. "You cut funding, state funding for the University of Wisconsin higher education system by 13 percent. You cut funding for the state parks system by 28 percent," Wallace said during the March 1, 2015 interview. "Governor, are those your priorities?" Walker responded by noting that critics said his 2011 budget cuts would devastate K-12 education, but graduation rates and reading scores are up. That led to this exchange: WALLACE: But the University of Wisconsin says they're going to have to raise tuition on students. WALKER: But they're not. We have a two-year tuition freeze. WALLACE: I know, but they're saying after that. WALKER: Going forward, we have a cap on it tied to inflation. And so, we will be much more affordable than just about any other campus in America. At issue are fears that big tuition hikes could be coming after 2017. They stem from Walker’s proposed Walker’s tuition freeze between 2015 and 2017, which would stymie UW from raising more revenue via tuition to replace the $300 million aid cut the governor wants. Walker is saying a big tuition increase won’t happen, and that UW schools will be near the top in affordability nationally. Let’s hit the books. We asked Kirsten Kukowski, a spokeswoman for Our American Revival, a group Walker formed as he explores a 2016 presidential bid, to back up Walker’s claim. She pointed us to 2014-’15 figures for tuition and fees at universities in other states compared with UW-Madison and at four-year public universities in Wisconsin as a group. The numbers come from a good source -- the College Board’s survey of college pricing trends. But Wisconsin is right in the middle of the pack or somewhat worse by various measures, the numbers show. -- All four-year schools: Among the states, Wisconsin’s average cost of in-state tuition and fees at these schools -- the "sticker price" at least -- ranked 26th highest. -- Flagship campuses: UW-Madison tuition and fees ranked 22nd highest compared to flagship campuses in the other 49 states. -- Two-year campuses: Wisconsin’s costs ranked 15th highest. Among four-year schools in the Big Ten (now with 14 schools), Nebraska, Iowa and Maryland charged less in 2014-’15 than Wisconsin. A gap of $2,000 to $3,000 a year separates Wisconsin and the least expensive states. Of course, nobody knows how the tuition rankings will look down the road after Walker’s freeze. But it would take a lot more than a freeze to put Wisconsin near the most affordable states. Cap on tuition? Next let’s look at Walker’s contention that "Going forward, we have a cap on it tied to inflation." The governor’s pending 2015-’17 budget plan would freeze tuition for the two years -- but it applies only to that period. Wallace, though, specifically asked about what happens after that. So that was the period Walker was citing when he referenced a "cap" going forward. Walker did suggest in February 2015 during a trade mission to the United Kingdom that he was "open" to the notion of putting an inflationary lid on tuition past 2016-’17. The idea drew criticism from UW-Madison Chancellor Rebecca Blank, who said it contradicted Walker’s plan to spin off the UW System as an independent authority with control over its budget and more ability to find efficiencies. In any case, no ongoing cap is in place. It’s not even formally introduced anywhere and Walker said he had no specific plan. So it’s not nearly the done deal Walker made it sound like. Our rating Walker said the University of Wisconsin schools "will be much more affordable than just about any other campus in America" because "going forward we have a cap on it tied to inflation." His evidence is current rankings, but they show the state is neither high nor low for student costs. And the inflationary cap the governor mentioned remains only a gleam in his eye. We rate his claim False. ------ More on Scott Walker For profiles and stories on Scott Walker and 2016 presidential politics, go to the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel's Scott Walker page.

Santorum said, "What we're seeing is a problem in our culture with respect to children being raised by children, children being raised out of wedlock, and the impact on society economically, the impact on society with respect to drug use and all -- a host of other things when children have children. … Two days ago on the front page of the New York Times, they're talking about the same thing. The bottom line is we have a problem in this country, and the family is fracturing. "Over 40 percent of children born in America are born out of wedlock. How can a country survive if children are being raised in homes where it's so much harder to succeed economically? It's five times the rate of poverty in single-parent households than it is in two-parent homes. … We hear this all the time, cut spending, limit the government, everything will be fine. No, everything's not going to be fine." Santorum touched on a lot of issues -- and essentially sidestepped the question from moderator John King, who had reminded him that "you told an evangelical blog, if elected, you will talk about what, quote, 'no president has talked about before -- the dangers of contraception.' Why?" For this item, we’ll focus on the main statistic he offered -- that "over 40 percent of children born in America are born out of wedlock." Simply put, he’s right. According to 2009 data from the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 41 percent of all births were to unmarried women. The percentage has risen steadily since at least 1980, the earliest year for which data was provided in the CDC report. In 1980, it stood at 18.4 percent. By 1990, it was 28.0 percent. And by 2000 it was 33.2 percent. "It has been increasing over the last 50 years," said Tom W. Smith, a senior fellow at the National Opinion Research Center at the University of Chicago. While we’re on this topic, we’ll also look at an issue that Mitt Romney brought up later in the debate -- that "among certain ethnic groups, the vast majority born out of wedlock." This data is also included in the CDC report. In 2009, 17 percent of births to Asian-Pacific Islanders were out of wedlock, with non-Hispanic whites at 29 percent, 53 percent for Hispanics, 65 percent for American Indians and Native Alaskans and 73 percent for non-Hispanic blacks. So Romney’s claim would be accurate at least for American Indians and non-Hispanic blacks. Meanwhile, within age groups, unmarried births accounted for 87 percent of those to teenagers and 62 percent of births to women age 20 to 24. About 20 percent of births to women age 30 and over were to unmarried mothers. But births to unmarried teens as a percentage of all unmarried births has declined. Unmarried teen births (those to mothers from age 15 to 19) represented 21 percent of all unmarried births, which is far lower than the rate in 1970, which was 49 percent. Our ruling Federal data backs up Santorum’s contention that "over 40 percent of children born in America are born out of wedlock." In fact, the number for 2009, the most recent available, is a record high, based on the data included in the federal report. So we rate the statement True.

pomt-13431	"Latinos in Nevada support Educational Savings Accounts, helping more than 450,000 students access better schools. But Catherine Cortez Masto is against it."	mostly true	/nevada/statements/2016/sep/19/libre-initiative/group-correct-catherine-cortez-masto-opposes-new-s/	The conservative-leaning LIBRE Initiative is using a new school choice program as political ammunition in Nevada’s competitive U.S. Senate race. The grassroots nonprofit, which has financial ties to the billionaire Koch brothers, released a digital ad in English and Spanish on Sept. 13 accusing Democratic Senate candidate Catherine Cortez Masto of opposing an educational program favored by Hispanics. "Latinos in Nevada support Educational Savings Accounts, helping more than 450,000 students access better schools," the ad says. "But Catherine Cortez Masto is against it." The second part of the claim is not in dispute, as Cortez Masto clearly came out in opposition to the program in August, saying it diverts money from public schools. But the ad overstates the Latino support and the number of people who are set to benefit from the ESA program, which has been tied up in lawsuits almost immediately after being passed. ESA 411 Nevada lawmakers approved a bevy of new educational programs in 2015, but one of the most controversial has been the Education Savings Account program. Approved by Republican lawmakers on a party-line vote, the bill creates a program allowing parents to pull their children out of public schools and receive roughly $5,100 (about 90 percent of yearly per-pupil funding) a year to be used for private education expenses — private school tuition, textbooks, transportation, etc. It’s similar to a school voucher system, but program backers say the key difference is that the money is distributed through "education savings accounts," state-run accounts that reimburse parents for approved educational expenses. Other states have created similar programs, but Nevada is unique in that all parents can apply for the program regardless of income or any other factor. Several groups, including the American Civil Liberties Union’s Nevada branch, sued before the program could be implemented and successfully had a legal hold placed on the program. The state’s Supreme Court heard arguments on the program in late July, and both sides are still awaiting for a ruling from the court. Total enrollment Constant litigation hasn’t stopped the program from turning into political ad material. The ad text claims that "more than 450,000 students to benefit from school choice," citing a 2015 Lincoln County Register editorial. That’s the total number of students in Nevada (now closer to 467,000), but isn’t anywhere close to the actual number of program applicants, which numbers around 7,800 at the most recent count. The program is open to all students, but it is misleading to say that all of them will "benefit" from the program when the number of applicants is so small. LIBRE Initiative spokesman Wadi Gaitan said in an email that continuing legal uncertainty over the program means that the number of applicants is an "incomplete" barometer of who the program is helping, as presumably some parents are waiting for the dust to settle before deciding to enroll in the program. The ad’s vocal track differs from the text overlay as well, saying the program would help "more than 450,000 students access better schools." Again, there are no barriers for parents to apply for the program, but it’s a bit far-fetched to assume that it will give literally every student in the state access to the school of their choosing given that tuition alone tends to cost more than the projected ESA stipend. Average private school tuition in Las Vegas ranges from $8,700 to $9,600 a year, according to information from privateschoolreview.com. Demographic data released on program applicants shows that the majority of parents applying live in ZIP codes with higher-than-normal average household incomes (though income levels of applicants aren’t disclosed). The ad also cites a 2015 poll funded by the American Federation for Children, a conservative-leaning nonprofit that champions "school choice." The group found that 71 percent of Nevada Hispanics polled favored the program. More recent polling found that the program is still supported by voters, though not as strongly as the earlier poll suggests. A KTNV-TV 13 Action News/Rasmussen Reports poll from August found that Hispanic voters polled supported the program on a 47 to 35 percent basis, with 17 percent undecided. Our ruling A new ad from the LIBRE Initiative claims, "Latinos in Nevada support Educational Savings Accounts, helping more than 450,000 students access better schools. But Catherine Cortez Masto is against it." There’s no question that Cortez Masto opposes the ESA program. But the ad exaggerates the size and scope of the program itself. Only a fraction of the state's 450,000 students have actually applied to be part of the program. The ad also accurately cites polls showing Hispanic support for the program, though recent polls show more modest support. Because this ad is accurate but needs clarification, we rate it Mostly True. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/736fb02e-95c9-43ad-a5ea-ec50d5c4839b	None	LIBRE Initiative	None	None	None	2016-09-19T16:30:48	2016-09-13	['Nevada']
pomt-06999	"Mitt Romney is the first Massachusetts politician to run for president and not win the New Hampshire primary in a generation."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/jul/10/new-hampshire-democratic-party/democrats-say-mitt-romney-first-massachusetts-resi/	Mitt Romney, now competing in his second New Hampshire primary, considers himself more than a neighbor from the south. The former Massachusetts governor, who owns a home on New Hampshire’s Lake Winnipesaukee, likes to think of himself as one of the Granite State’s own. But state Democratic leaders were quick to point out last week that state voters haven’t always returned Romney’s affection. Speaking with reporters on a June 27, 2011, conference call, Democratic Party Chairman Ray Buckley said Romney, who placed second in the 2008 primary, was the first Bay State politician in decades who failed to win the New Hampshire primary. "It's important to note that Mitt Romney is the first Massachusetts politician to run for president and not win the New Hampshire primary in a generation," Buckley said. "The people of New Hampshire know him very well." PolitiFact decided to check the record books. Prior to Romney’s last run in 2008, the last three Massachusetts politicians to run for the Oval Office all got off to good starts by winning the New Hampshire primary, according to state voting records. In 2004, John Kerry, the U.S. Senator from Massachusetts, won the Democratic primary, defeating former Vermont Gov. Howard Dean, among other candidates. Twelve years earlier, in 1992, U.S. Sen. Paul Tsongas defeated Bill Clinton to win the primary; and four years prior to that, Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis won the primary on his way to the 1988 Democratic nomination. Political analysts say all three Massachusetts residents took advantage of the physical -- and philosophical -- proximity of the two states. Voters from both states tend to hold common cultural values, political attitudes and histories, according to Andrew Smith, director of the University of New Hampshire Survey Center. And, because much of southern New Hampshire, the state’s most populous area, falls within the Boston media market, Granite State voters are often familiar with Massachusetts candidates even before election season begins, added David King, a lecturer at Harvard University’s Kennedy School of Government. But the home court advantage doesn’t help all Massachusetts candidates. Indeed, you need only go back to 1980, when U.S. Sen. Edward Kennedy lost his bold bid to unseat President Jimmy Carter. So it was 28 years between that loss and Romney's. Does that count as "a generation"? To find out, we asked the experts. Genealogists across the country don’t have a set definition for the length of a generation, the time between the birth of a parent and that parent’s child. We found a range of answers from 20 to 30 years. Ancestry.com, a national genealogical website, considers a generation as 25 years; the New England Genealogical Society accepts a generation as 25 to 30 years, and the U.S. Genealogical Society extends it between 20 and 30 years. "Anywhere between twenty and thirty years seems to be the standard, but there is no hard and fast rule," said Laura Prescott, a Brookline, New Hampshire resident and president of the Association of Professional Genealogists. "It’s something that changes over time, and it’s an inexact science." Our ruling Buckley said Romney was the first candidate to lose "in a generation." Buckley is right if you rely on the shorter time period of 20 or 25 years, but he is off if you rely on the 30-year standard. Even so, he wouldn't be that far off, and his underlying point is correct that Romney's 2008 loss was unusual by historical standards. So we find his claim Mostly True.

pomt-05843	Says U.S. Rep. Tammy Baldwin, a candidate for Senate, supports raising taxes "by $858 billion."	mostly false	/wisconsin/statements/2012/feb/15/us-chamber-commerce/us-chamber-says-rep-tammy-baldwin-backed-raising-t/	There was never any doubt that opponents of U.S. Rep. Tammy Baldwin of Wisconsin, a Madison Democrat running for the U.S. Senate, would brand her as a liberal who loves taxes. On the day Baldwin announced her candidacy in September 2011, Republican Senate candidate Tommy Thompson called her the most liberal member of the House. Based on annual ratings of House members’ votes, we gave Thompson a Mostly True on that claim. Now two major business organizations say Baldwin loves taxes enough to raise them "by $858 billion" -- and they cite Baldwin’s own website as evidence. A politician touting an $858 billion tax increase? This could get interesting. The claim is made in a TV ad sponsored by Wisconsin Manufacturers and Commerce and paid for by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. The ad was released Feb. 9, 2012. It begins with a narrator saying: "Washington has made things tough for job creators. More red tape doesn't help. ‘Obamacare’ will kill jobs; Tammy Baldwin fought hard for it. Taxes? Tammy Baldwin thinks they're too low and wants to raise them." At that point, a message on the screen reads: "Tammy Baldwin -- raise taxes by $858 billion" and lists Baldwin’s official House website as the source. Is it an accurate attack? ‘Bush-era tax cuts’ The Wisconsin business group referred us to the U.S. Chamber, which referred us to the taxes page on Baldwin’s website. It discusses her vote against an $858 billion bill that extended what are known as the Bush-era tax cuts. The tax cuts -- on income, capital gains, dividends and business -- were enacted in 2001 and 2003 under President George W. Bush. They were temporary -- their major provisions were to expire at the end of 2010. The bill Baldwin voted against was adopted and signed into law in December 2010. On the web page cited by the chamber, Baldwin says she supported continuing the tax cuts only for families that earn up to $250,000, because "adding $858 billion to the national debt just to give a special tax break to those with incomes over $250,000 is fiscally irresponsible." The ad’s claim about Baldwin is based on that single no vote. But, as we’ll see, it wasn’t the only measure put to a vote in the House on extending the Bush tax cuts. And the $858 billion figure -- though widely cited -- is more complicated than presented in the ad. What’s in the $858 billion The law extends the Bush tax cuts two more years -- but it also provided a new, temporary payroll tax cut, made other tax changes and extended unemployment benefits for 13 months. The total "cost" of the package -- in terms of how much it adds to federal budget deficits -- is estimated at nearly $858 billion over 10 years, according to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office. About $721 billion of that is reduced revenue from the tax changes -- including $408 billion from the two-year extension of the Bush tax cuts -- and the rest is from additional spending. So, does Baldwin’s vote against an $858 billion bill composed primarily of tax cuts mean she supported raising taxes by $858 billion? Not exactly. Had Baldwin’s side defeated the bill -- and had the Bush tax cuts been allowed to expire -- the people who benefited from those tax cuts would have been paying higher taxes as of January 2011. But, as we’ve noted, the bill also contained other measures such as the new cut in payroll taxes and the extension of unemployment benefits. So, it can’t be argued that taxes would have been raised by a full $858 billion had Baldwin’s side prevailed. Secondly, had the $858 billion bill been defeated, it doesn’t necessarily mean the debate would have ended and that the Bush tax cuts would have expired; another bill could have emerged. Baldwin campaign spokesman Phil Walzak pointed out that a week before the vote on the $858 billion bill that became law, Baldwin voted for an alternative that would have extended the Bush tax cuts, permanently, for families earning less than $250,000. The failed measure also would have made other changes that would have added a total of $1.5 trillion to the deficit over 10 years, according to the Congressional Budget Office. Nearly all of that, $1.34 trillion, would have been revenue lost from making most of the Bush tax cuts permanent. To compare the two bills only in terms of extending the Bush tax cuts: The bill Baldwin voted against reduces revenue by $408 billion for two years, or $204 billion on an annual basis. The bill Baldwin voted for would have reduced revenue $1.34 trillion over 10 years, or $134 billion per year. So, Baldwin supported extending most of the Bush tax cuts, although taxes would have gone up for families earning $250,000 or more. In the end, there were two votes on competing proposals. By using the approach the ad uses, Democrats would be able to argue that those who voted against the first, more limited package, opposed cutting taxes. Our ruling In a TV ad, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce says Baldwin supports raising taxes by $858 billion, citing her vote against a bill that primarily contained tax cuts. It’s true that had Baldwin’s side prevailed and if no other action was taken, taxes would have increased, although not by the full $858 billion. But Baldwin did vote separately for a measure that would have extended most of the Bush tax cuts. And it can’t be assumed that the Bush tax cuts would not have been extended had the bill Baldwin opposed not become law. There’s only an element of truth in the chamber’s claim, which is our definition for Mostly False.
