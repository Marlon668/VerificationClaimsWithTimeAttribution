pomt-15191	"Peachtree and Pine is one of the leading sites for tuberculosis in the nation."	mostly true	/georgia/statements/2015/aug/19/kasim-reed/tb-real-concern-controversial-atlanta-shelter/	Atlanta Mayor Kasim Reed has made no secret of wanting to close the homeless shelter at Peachtree and Pine streets. Reed, who has been active in downtown’s post-Recession resurgence, says he’ll push for the city to acquire the property through eminent domain and turn it into a police precinct and fire station. Health concerns are a major reason for closing the Peachtree-Pines shelter, Reed said during a lunchtime speech to Atlanta’s Commerce Club on Tuesday, Aug. 11. "Peachtree and Pine is one of the leading sites for tuberculosis in the nation," he told the crowd. Reed said top officials with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recently asked to meet with him and "laid out how tuberculosis cases, not in Georgia, but across America, are being traced back to Peachtree and Pine." Could Peachtree-Pine, billed as the largest homeless shelter in the Southeast, be a leading site for tuberculosis in the nation? PolitiFact decided to do some checking. First a little background. The homeless are prime candidates for tuberculosis because they typically have greater exposure to cold weather, are in crowded conditions when they stay in shelters and lack proper nutrition and medical care. That means shelters, such as Peachtree-Pine, have to be vigilant to avoid becoming breeding grounds for TB, which is spread person to person through the air and caused by the bacteria Mycobacterium tuberculosis. TB normally attacks the lungs, but also can strike the kidney, spine, brain or another body part. In most cases, tuberculosis is treatable and curable, although people can die if they don’t receive the proper treatment. Most people live with the bacteria, or latent TB infection, without feeling sick or showing symptoms. In 2014, 9,412 new tuberculosis cases were reported in the U.S., 334 in Georgia, according to the CDC. A new drug-resistant strain of TB was discovered in 2008 at the shelter at Peachtree and Pine, which is run by the Metro Atlanta Task Force for the Homeless. The strain was labeled G05625 TB by the CDC. The research To fact check Reed’s statement, we reached out to Fulton County government, the CDC, the mayor’s office and the Georgia Department of Public Health, as well as shelter management. Anita Beaty, Peachtree-Pine’s executive director, rejects Reed’s assessment of the shelter and says it is "100 percent compliant" with CDC protocol for spotting, treating and avoiding the spread of TB. She said Reed and the business community have conspired for years to force the shelter to close so they can take over its prime location, just south of Midtown and in sight of the Fox Theatre. Tuberculosis has been a worry at all Atlanta and Fulton County shelters, not just Peachtree-Pine, for years. But alarm bells apparently really started going off after an uptick in TB cases last year. "At a time when the incidents of tuberculosis has been declining across the metropolitan Atlanta area and the rest of Georgia, it has actually increased in Fulton County," Brenda Fitzgerald, commissioner of the Georgia Department of Public Health, wrote Fulton County Commission Chair John Eaves in April. A month later, officials with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention were sitting down for the first of two meetings with Reed about the ongoing TB problem generally, and Peachtree-Pine specifically. "Our inability to control (the Peachtree-Pine) outbreak has led to infections in multiple other states," Philip A. LoBue and Jonathan Mermin, doctors with the National Center for HIV/AIDS, Viral Hepatitis, STD, and TB Prevention, wrote Reed after they met in May. Based on interviews, data and documents that PolitiFact reviewed, here’s a summary of the major points. -- Since 2008, new cases of the drug-resistant strain of TB that originated at the Peachtree-Pine shelter have turned up in metro Atlanta and Georgia as well as eight other states -- Alabama, California, Florida, Illinois, New York, North Carolina, Pennsylvania and South Carolina. (Genotype evidence, similar to a fingerprint, exists for every strain of TB, and that’s how every new case of G05625 in the state and nation can be traced to the Peachtree-Pine shelter. Similarly, that’s how the Ebola outbreak in west Africa in 201, was traced back to a 2-year-old from a small village in Guinea who died in 2013 and who became known around the world as Patient Zero.) -- At Fulton County’s four shelters, the number of TB cases rose by 230 percent, from 13 in 2013 to 43 in 2014. Twenty-two of the 43 cases, or slightly more than 50 percent, were at Peachtree-Pine. (The CDC defines a large outbreak as being 10 or more cases, CDC spokesman Brian Katzowitz said.) -- The number of drug-resistant G05625 tuberculosis cases, those linked to Peachtree-Pine, grew 10-fold from 2013 to 2014, from two to 23. -- Fulton County accounted for 82 percent of all cases of that strain of tuberculosis in Georgia and 69 percent of all cases of the strain in the United States. -- At least four clients of the Peachtree-Pine shelter, according to Fitzgerald, have died of tuberculosis since early 2014. In her letter to Eaves, Fitzgerald said, public health researchers identified the homeless shelter at the corner of Peachtree and Pine Streets "as a major source of the current outbreak. "If it [tuberculosis] gains a foothold in the community, then the cost in healthcare and human suffering will be incalculable," she wrote. Jessica A. Corbitt-Dominguez, director of external affairs for Fulton County government, said Fulton health workers, in conjunction with officials from the Georgia Department of Public Health and CDC, responded to the outbreak with an aggressive campaign of education, testing and treatment. Anyone with active disease was relocated from the shelters while in treatment under the supervision of Fulton Health and Wellness. The county set up special teams that make daily visits to shelters to perform screenings and administer medicines, Corbitt-Dominguez said. In June 2015, the county health department also signed memorandums of understanding (MOUs) with four shelters, including Peachtree and Pine. This was considered a significant step since a lack of administrative controls and protocols is considered a likely contributor to the spread of TB. As of this month, the number of 2015 confirmed TB cases at Fulton homeless shelters is 13, Corbitt-Dominguez said. Beaty’s attorney last week provided reporters with a certificate showing the shelter is fully in compliance with the CDC’s TB protocol, and Beaty told PolitiFact "it’s ludicrous to think we wouldn’t be on it." Corbitt-Dominguez confirmed that the shelter has never been cited by the county, although Eaves has said there have been concerns about the shelter’s TB safeguards. In a letter to Fitzgerald, he wrote that the shelter’s administration "routinely exhibits sub-optimal administration of the procedures required to control the spread of this disease." Beaty said Reed’s statement makes clear he "is just not getting good information." "We have been cleared by Fulton County, which is on site every day to monitor. And we’ve got 100 percent clearance from the CDC’s requirements," she said. "We resent those easy headlines that have no basis in fact and that marginalize homeless people in our facilities." Tom Andrews, president of the non-profit Mercy Care, which operates 14 clinics, some associated with shelters, said the strain of TB originating at Peachtree-Pine has to be a major concern. Since it is medicine-resistant, it requires a more expensive and longer treatment program, Andrews said. The CDC estimates that the costs of treating a person with TB increases with greater resistance. Direct costs in 2010 U.S. dollars average from $17,000 to treat drug-susceptible TB to $430,000 to treat the most drug-resistant form, according to the agency’s website. So is it a national leader in TB? We asked the mayor’s office for evidence to back up Reed’s statement that Peachtree-Pine "is one of the leading sites for tuberculosis in the nation." Anne Torres, his spokeswoman, provided us copies of the letters from Fitzgerald and the doctors, as well as a highly technical report from the CDC. We reached out to the CDC. A spokesperson said agency officials would not comment on the mayor’s public statements. CDC officials also would not identify the states where they said the TB strain from Peachtree-Pine had spread. We were able to obtain that list from the Georgia Department of Public Health, as well as the number of cases of G05625 strain TB in each state from 2008 to 2014. The most were in Florida (14), followed by California (8) and North Carolina and Alabama (2 each). New York, Illinois, Pennsylvania and South Carolina each reported one case in the five years -- for a total of 30 in the eight states in five years. But do 30 cases over a several-year period raise Peachtree-Pine to a leading site of TB in the nation? We posed that question to Philip Hopewell, a leading tuberculosis expert and professor of medicine at the University of California, San Francisco. "Peachtree and Pine is clearly a major site for transmission of Mycobacterium tuberculosis, and it may be one of the leading sites in the nation," Hopewell said. "However, there are not data from every such facility in the country," he added. "To say that the Atlanta facility is one of the leading sites in the country -- it probably is -- implies that there are data with which to compare the Atlanta facility. Thus, strictly speaking, what he said can't be backed with evidence. Even so, I wouldn't fault the mayor for saying this." Our ruling Mayor Kasim Reed said "Peachtree and Pine is one of the leading sites for tuberculosis in the nation." Thirty cases of a medicine-resistant strain of TB in eight states have been traced back to the shelter at Peachtree and Pine. The shelter also had a large share of the cases in a recent TB outbreak in Fulton County and four TB deaths, according to state data. CDC officials clearly believe it’s a concern, but a leading tuberculosis expert says there’s a dearth of comparative data. We rate Reed’s statement Mostly True.

pomt-01749	"Global warming is a hoax."	pants on fire!	/truth-o-meter/statements/2014/aug/01/lenar-whitney/republican-congressional-hopeful-says-global-warmi/	Can a 10-year-old debunk "the greatest deception in the history of mankind?" One congressional hopeful thinks so. A five-minute video outlining the beliefs of Republican Lenar Whitney, a Louisiana state representative running for U.S. Congress, has been making its rounds on the Internet over the past couple of days. And what does Whitney think is a big-government "scam" and "conspiracy"? The video’s title says it all: "Global Warming is a Hoax." "Energy security is real, global warming is not. It is merely a strategy designed to give more power to the executive branch while increasing taxes in a progressive stream to regulate every aspect of American life," Whitney says in the video. The video might not have received much national attention if it weren’t for a Washington Post column in which David Wasserman of the Cook Political Report called Whitney "the most frightening candidate (he’s) met in seven years interviewing congressional hopefuls." On top of frightening, Wasserman -- who has interviewed more than 300 congressional candidates -- called her "fact-averse." Whitney is running for an open seat that represents parts of Baton Rouge. The race is attracting a large field of candidates that includes former Gov. Edwin Edwards, a Democrat who served time in prison for racketeering. We’ve lost track of how many times we’ve fact-checked climate change denial claims and found them to be False or Pants on Fire. (See here, here and here.) But given that it's still being talked about, we thought it was worth reviewing the evidence again. Whitney's video offers some specific pieces of evidence that are in need of debunking. The hoax We talked to several climate scientists who said Whitney’s claim was "laughable," "deeply misguided," "uninformed," "disgusting" and "absurd." So is there a mass conspiracy to pull the wool over the world’s eyes? It seems highly unlikely, considering the numerous studies that show overwhelming consensus among respected scientists that anthropogenic (human-caused) global warming is indisputable. Among climate researchers most actively publishing scientific articles, at least 97 percent believe in anthropogenic climate change, found one 2009 study published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, a scientific journal. The study examined published scientific articles and surveyed experts. The study says that the few "contrarian" scientists are a vocal, but small, minority. They also found that those scientists denying human-caused climate change tend to have less expertise in the subject than those who believe in it. Another survey out of the University of Illinois found that 82 percent of earth scientists (out of more than 3,000 respondents) believe that global temperature shifts are human-caused. Among climate-specific earth scientists who responded, 97.4 percent said they believe in human-caused climate change. "It seems that the debate on the authenticity of global warming and the role played by human activity is largely nonexistent among those who understand the nuances and scientific basis of long-term climate processes," the 2009 report said. "The challenge, rather, appears to be how to effectively communicate this fact to policymakers and a public that continues to mistakenly perceive debate among scientists." Beyond the surveys, there is a consensus among the world’s premier science organizations -- such as the National Academy of Sciences, the American Association for the Advancement of Science, and the Royal Society in London -- that human-caused global warming is real, said Riley Dunlap, an environmental sociology professor at Oklahoma State University. (Not to mention NASA, the American Meteorological Society, the American Geophysical Union and the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.) Dunlap co-authored a study published in 2013 that found a strong link between conservative think tanks and climate change denial books. It also found that a growing number of these books are produced by people with no scientific training, and nearly 90 percent of the books examined did not go through a peer review process, meaning they were not subjected to scientific scrutiny. And the consensus is not limited to just scientists. For example, Admiral James Locklear, commander of American naval forces in the Pacific, told the Boston Globe last year that climate change and rising sea levels are the biggest long-term security threat to the region. Recently, former Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson, who served under former President George W. Bush, wrote a column in the New York Times urging lawmakers to take action to combat climate change for the sake of the economy. David Jenkins, president of Conservatives for Responsible Stewardship, said there is no legitimate reason to doubt the severity of climate change. "A true conservative would be prudent, listen to the experts and take action to address the threat," Jenkins said. His group aims to foster understanding about the environment among conservatives. Some conservatives say global warming is real, but has not risen to levels portrayed by the Obama administration, such as Chip Knappenberger, assistant director of the Center for the Study of Science at the Cato Institute, a conservative think tank. Knappenberger said that what’s questionable is how much of a threat human carbon emissions pose and whether proposed regulations will do more harm than good. Climate change skeptics’ talking points have evolved since the 1990s as the scientific evidence has grown, said Dunlap, who has been studying public opinion of climate change for 20 years. They first said the Earth wasn’t warming. Then they said the Earth was warming, but it’s not caused by human activity. Now, many agree with the science, but it’s not that big of a problem. "But in (Whitney’s) case, she’s reverting to some of the most primitive statements," Dunlap said. Her evidence? Whitney’s supporting evidence used in her video is too simplistic to be meaningful. Here's a few of her pieces of evidence: "Any 10 year old can invalidate their thesis with one of the simplest scientific devices known to man: a thermometer. The Earth has done nothing but get colder each year since the film’s release," she said, referring to former Vice President Al Gore’s 2006 global warming film An Inconvenient Truth. Global temperatures have "paused" growth over the past several years, but to say this is proof global warming isn’t real is cherry-picking. As we’ve previously reported, 12 of the past 15 years have been the hottest years on record, according to NASA. Tied for the top are 2005 and 2010. (Even the source that Whitney’s campaign pointed us to agreed that there has been no significant cooling trend in the past few years.) The past 150 years have been characterized by overall warming, with intermittent periods of slowed warming or cooling, said Mark Serreze, director of the National Snow and Ice Data Center at the University of Colorado-Boulder. "Fifty years from now, and assuming that carbon dioxide concentrations continue to rise at current rates, the period of slower warming from the late 1990s (of 2006) to present will appear as just another blip on the overall pattern of warming," he said. Whitney also said, "Last summer, Antarctica reached the coldest temperature in recorded history." Ted Scambos of the National Snow and Ice Data Center did record the lowest temperature ever recorded on Earth: about -135 degrees fahrenheit. But Serreze said this is one temperature taken at one location, so it has little to do with global warming. It was more a triumph of technology, because a satellite recorded the temperature remotely. And Whitney said there is "record sheet ice and a 60 percent rise of ice in the Arctic sea." Serreze said Whitney likely meant "sea ice," which has had record highs in recent years. Sheet ice refers to land-based features, like Greenland and Antarctica. But this also doesn’t disprove global warming. Ozone depletion and greenhouse gases intensifies westerly winds and drives them south, which causes sea ice in Antarctica to extend further north, wrote Guy Williams, a sea ice specialist at the University of Tasmania, in a Washington Post column last month. In the Arctic Sea, the minimum ice extent (measured in September) for 2013 was about 50 percent higher than it was in 2012, according to the National Snow and Ice Data Center. But 2012’s minimum ice extent was a record low in the satellite era, so even though Arctic ice extent grew, it was still far below average in 2013. Overall, sea ice (measured every September via satellite) has decreased about 13 percent each decade since 1981, Serreze said. Whitney mentions a trove of leaked emails from the University of East Anglia in England between some of the world’s leading climate scientists. She says the 2009 emails prove global warming is a "scam," and scientists faked and hid data. But several investigations concluded that there was no data manipulation, despite climate change skeptics’ claims. A bonus: Jenkins pointed out that the thermometer Whitney holds up in her video is not a weather thermometer, but a medical thermometer. Our ruling Whitney said, "global warming is a hoax." There is an overwhelming consensus among respected scientists that human-caused global warming is real, and Whitney’s supporting evidence falls flat. We rate this claim Pants on Fire.

pomt-00665	Says that as president, Barack Obama has not gone to the Texas-Mexico border	false	/wisconsin/statements/2015/may/13/scott-walker/scott-walker-says-barack-obama-has-never-been-texa/	During a trip through the crucial presidential state of Iowa, Gov. Scott Walker did an interview on April 25, 2015 with Caffeinated Thoughts, a website that says it looks at "culture, current events, faith and politics from a Christian and conservative point of view." When Walker was asked about his position on immigration reform, he began his answer by saying: "Number of things. Border security for sure. Unlike this president, I’ve actually gone to the border and been there with the governor of Texas," Walker said, referring to a trip he made a month earlier. Wait, what? Immigration has long been a huge national issue. Barack Obama has been president for more than six years. Is Walker right that Obama has never been to the Texas-Mexico border? Walker’s evidence AshLee Strong, spokeswoman for Our American Revival, the group Walker created in anticipation of a campaign for president, responded to our request for information to back Walker’s statement. She essentially tried to modify the governor’s claim by narrowing the time frame, saying Obama "chose not to go to the border while he was in Texas in 2014 during a humanitarian crisis" at the border. Walker, of course, made a much broader claim. But let’s start with his evidence: a July 9, 2014 CBS News report. On the day the report was posted online, Obama arrived in Texas for a previously planned two-day trip that was to involve talking to Texans about the economy and attending Democratic fundraisers. At the time, there had been a surge in the number children and teens from Central America crossing the Mexico-U.S. border unaccompanied by a parent. Many of the youths fled drug violence at home, but faced new challenges in the United States because the border patrol system wasn’t equipped to handle them, according to news reports. Changes in policy to expand legal residence opportunities in the United States for undocumented youth may have led some families to send younger family members on the journey north. Because of the crisis at the border, Obama altered his plans to include a meeting, in Dallas, with then-Gov. Rick Perry and local officials to discuss the situation at the border. But Obama -- resisting calls from lawmakers in both parties -- did not visit the border, although several senior members of his administration had done so. More to the point of Walker’s claim, however, the news report he cited also said Obama had visited the border in May 2011. We found that Obama visited El Paso on May 10, 2011. (Our colleagues rated as True his statement during his speech there that the Border Patrol had doubled the number of its agents since 2004.) A Washington Post report on the speech said Obama was "standing within sight of Mexico" and that it was his his first trip to the U.S.-Mexico border as president. That was his only visit to the border as president. Our rating Walker said that "unlike this president, I've actually gone to the (Texas) border." Obama certainly hasn’t been a frequent visitor, but as president he did go to the border once, in May 2011 to give a speech on immigration reform. We rate Walker’s statement False.

pomt-11167	Marc Molinaro "has cut taxes, his budget now is lower than it was six years ago" in Dutchess County	half-true	/new-york/statements/2018/may/24/edward-cox/race-governor-molinaros-record-taxes-and-spending/	Dutchess County Executive Marc Molinaro, a Republican running for governor, wants to cut state spending and reduce taxes for New York state residents. That’s something he’s already done in his county, State Republican Chairman Edward F. Cox said. "He has really done very well in each of the offices he’s held, particularly as the county executive of Dutchess County, where he has cut taxes, his budget now is lower than it was six years ago," Cox said in a radio interview. Molinaro has been the top elected official in Dutchess County since 2012. He has been a vocal critic of Medicaid and unfunded mandates from the state that drive up local property taxes. He wants the state to shoulder more of the cost for those services. At the same time, he wants to cut state spending to keep state taxes low. Is Cox right that Molinaro has already cut spending and property taxes in Dutchess County? Property Taxes A spokesperson for Cox pointed to the county’s approved budgets while Molinaro’s been in office. This year’s budget in Dutchess County reduced both the county property tax rate for residents and the tax levy for the fourth consecutive year, according to budget documents. But his first two budgets increased property taxes by about 2 percent in 2013 and again in 2014. The lower tax rates and levies don’t mean property taxes have gone down for every resident in Dutchess County. Property tax bills are a combination of taxes levied by the county and each municipality. While the county’s tax levy has gone down, some local taxes may have increased. Property taxes levied by Poughkeepsie, for example, rose by 16.5 percent in 2017. Total spending Dutchess County spending, on the other hand, has gone up every year Molinaro has been in office. Total spending increased by about 6 percent between his first budget and 2017, according to the county's budget office. Total spending for 2018 won't be known until next year. Part of that is mandated spending by the state. Budget documents show the cost of mandated services has increased by close to $3 million since 2015. Cox’s spokesperson said he was thinking about the county’s workforce when he said total spending was down in Dutchess County. Molinaro has approved cuts in the county workforce since taking office. Budget documents show the county planned to employ 1,753 full-time employees in 2018, down from 1,823 when Molinaro took office. Our ruling Cox said Molinaro has cut taxes and spending as Dutchess County Executive. He’s right that county property taxes are lower. But spending has risen more than 6 percent since Molinaro's first budget. Cox’s claim is partially accurate. On balance, we rate it Half True. EDITOR'S NOTE: A previous version of this article used numbers from county budget documents to show changes in spending. Those numbers did not reflect the county's actual expenses, the county's budget office said. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com	None	Edward Cox	None	None	None	2018-05-24T08:27:18	2018-05-01	['None']
pomt-11224	"Tammy Baldwin cosponsored legislation that wanted to establish the Department of Peace and Nonviolence."	mostly true	/wisconsin/statements/2018/may/09/kevin-nicholson/sen-tammy-baldwin-did-back-department-peace-kevin-/	While defending his criticism of military veterans who support Democrats, Kevin Nicholson also attacked Wisconsin U.S. Sen. Tammy Baldwin -- the Democrat whose job he wants. Nicholson was interviewed May 4, 2018 by Dan O’Donnell, who hosts a conservative talk show on WISN-AM in Milwaukee. Nicholson, a first-time candidate and former Marine, said: Tammy Baldwin cosponsored legislation that wanted to establish the Department of Peace and Nonviolence. That’s a fundamentally unserious answer to a serious question -- the question being, How do we keep the American people safe? She’s going to have to answer for that in this election. I’m going to make sure that she does. Nicholson made essentially the same claim about Baldwin and the Department of Peace in another Milwaukee radio interview two days earlier. Moreover, both Nicholson and state Sen. Leah Vukmir -- the two Republicans vying in the August 2018 primary to challenge Baldwin three months later -- are trying to portray Baldwin as extreme. So is an outside group -- although we rated Mostly False its claim that Baldwin "supported legislation allowing citizens to withhold funding for our troops." As we’ll see, Baldwin did back the Department of Peace legislation, which the Washington Post called the "Hope Diamond of liberal ideas: pure, breathtaking and highly impractical in the real world." But it’s important to note that Baldwin’s most recent cosponsorship was before she left the House for the Senate, and that as a senator she has backed certain national defense measures. Like us on Facebook. Follow us on Twitter: @PolitiFactWisc The legislation To back Nicholson’s claim, his campaign cited Baldwin’s cosponsorship, as a member of the U.S. House, of the 2007 version of the Department of Peace and Nonviolence Act. It was introduced by then-U.S. Rep. Dennis Kucinich, D-Ohio. (Baldwin for 14 years held the Madison-area House seat now held by Democrat Mark Pocan. She joined the Senate in 2013.) In 2009, Kucinich introduced a similar measure, the Department of Peace Act. Baldwin cosponsored it and she cosponsored the 2011 version. The 2012 Post article said that with the $10 billion-a-year Department of Peace: A secretary of peace would sit in the president’s Cabinet and on the National Security Council. The secretary would be given a special new role in the country’s military decisions: If a conflict was about to start, the secretaries of defense and state would have to consult the Peace secretary "concerning nonviolent means of conflict resolution." The Congress.gov summary of the bill said the department’s mission would be to: Hold peace as an organizing principle; endeavor to promote justice and democratic principles to expand human rights; and develop policies that promote national and international conflict prevention, nonviolent intervention, mediation, peaceful resolution of conflict, and structured mediation of conflict. The bills were referred to committee, but no other actions were taken. In response to Nicholson’s claim, Baldwin’s campaign told us the peace secretary also would have been charged with developing policies to address domestic violence and reduce incarceration; and the campaign said that one of the nation’s founding fathers, Benjamin Rush, had promoted the idea of a peace secretary. More fact checks on the Senate candidates: Kevin Nicholson Tammy Baldwin Leah Vukmir And though she is far from being a hawk, Baldwin has been out front on certain defense measures: Pressing President Donald Trump in late 2017 to fund Wisconsin-made Littoral Combat Ships. Touting her vote for the 2018 National Defense Authorization Act, saying it strengthens national security. Our rating Nicholson says Baldwin "cosponsored legislation that wanted to establish the Department of Peace and Nonviolence." Baldwin did cosponsor, as a member of the House before joining the Senate, the 2007, 2009 and 2011 versions of those bills, which did not become law. But it’s important to note, in terms of Nicholson’s suggestion that the cosponsorships were Baldwin’s answer to national security problems, that Baldwin has supported some defense-spending measures, as well. We rate Nicholson’s statement Mostly True. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com	None	Kevin Nicholson	None	None	None	2018-05-09T06:00:00	2018-05-04	['Tammy_Baldwin']
pomt-13769	"Forty-three million Americans are on food stamps."	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/jul/21/donald-trump/trump-43-million-americans-food-stamps/	For all of the spending in Washington under President Barack Obama, the American people are not better off, Donald Trump argued in his July 21 speech accepting the Republican presidential nomination. "President Obama has almost doubled our national debt to more than $19 trillion, and growing," Trump said. "Yet what do we have to show for it? Our roads and bridges are falling apart, our airports are in third-world condition, and 43 million Americans are on food stamps." We wanted to fact-check his statistic about Americans using the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, the program formerly known as food stamps. SNAP benefits provide vouchers for groceries for qualifying low-income Americans. The U.S. Department of Agriculture, which oversees SNAP, counted almost 43.6 million people in the program in April 2016, the most recent data available. So Trump is on point, numbers-wise. But there’s a dollop more to the story. The amount of people on food stamps, while considerable, is an improvement. When Obama took office in January 2009, almost 32 million people received SNAP benefits. The number increased during the Great Recession as more families turned to the program for assistance, averaging an annual high of 47.6 million participants in 2013. A report by the Food Research & Action Center, a hunger and nutrition advocacy group, applauded the 43 million figure in April as the lowest level of participants since October 2010. From April 2015 to April 2016, participation is down 1.9 million participants. We explained in a previous fact-check that it’s unclear whether SNAP sign-ups would have been just as high under a Republican president, as the economy was weakening before Obama took office. The beneficiary pool was already increasing under President George W. Bush, whose administration broadened eligibility criteria and tried to get more Americans to apply for SNAP assistance. The Republican policy platform approved at the RNC recommends breaking the SNAP program away from the USDA and the farm bill, under which funding for the program is usually negotiated in Congress. As an independent entity, SNAP would be more vulnerable to budget cuts. Our ruling Trump said, "Forty-three million Americans are on food stamps."

pomt-09523	"We have billions in surplus."	mostly false	/texas/statements/2010/feb/12/rick-perry/perry-says-texas-has-surplus/	Republican Gov. Rick Perry, running for re-election, claims the "tough conservative decisions" he’s made during his tenure have been a boon to the state, resulting in surplus revenue. "Today, we have billions in surplus," he says in a TV ad that debuted Monday. Is that right? Seems like just the other day — as in last month — Republican leaders including Perry asked state agencies to suggest possible budget cuts due to an anticipated revenue shortfall. Perry’s campaign cites a Nov. 24 report by Texas State Comptroller Susan Combs forecasting the state would have $8.2 billion in its Economic Stabilization Fund by Aug. 31, 2011. The so-called rainy day fund, which voters created in 1988, held $7.6 billion as of Feb. 9. The fund is fed almost exclusively by oil and natural-gas production taxes; revenue above a certain level is automatically diverted to it. That revenue soared during the past decade, allowing billions to accumulate. So the state now has billions in reserve. But a healthy rainy day fund doesn’t always mean there’s a surplus built to last. Sherri Greenberg, a former Democratic state representative who served on the House Appropriations Committee, said that the excess oil and gas taxes are "not the same as a surplus" because they aren’t necessarily "revenues coming in that exceed what our expenditures are going to be." Greenberg, who lectures at the Lyndon B. Johnson School of Public Affairs, noted too that it’s not easy to tap the fund. In the 2011 session, Lawmakers will legally be permitted to dip into the fund for any reason by two-thirds' votes of the House and Senate. If they're faced with revenue running short of what's needed to fund the current (2010-11) budget, they can take money from the fund by getting three-fifths' votes of each body. The same reduced threshold applies to tapping the fund if state revenue for the 2012-13 fiscal years is projected to run short of revenue that comes in during 2010-11. Other fiscal decisions take simple majority votes. Besides, experts expect lawmakers to be facing a revenue shortfall by the time they write the next two-year state budget in 2011. Factors at play include the need to continue covering the costs of a statewide school property tax cut approved in 2006 and the unlikelihood of fresh federal stimulus aid, some of which helped lawmakers balance the budget last year. John O’Brien, director of the Legislative Budget Board, which advises legislators on budget matters, recently estimated that the current pace of spending will exceed incoming revenue by $11 billion by the time the 2012 fiscal year begins on Sept. 1, 2011. State sales-tax collections are already running $1 billion behind what Combs projected they would be at this time. On Jan. 15, Perry, Lt. Gov. David Dewhurst and House Speaker Joe Straus instructed state agencies to submit budget-reduction plans by Feb. 15 for the start of next fiscal year. As they have done in the past, lawmakers could tap the rainy day fund to reconcile the gap. Faced with a similar $10 billion revenue shortfall in 2003, lawmakers also made painful budget and program cuts, including consolidating 12 health and human service agencies into five. "The point of the rainy day fund is to have it there in case there’s a need," Perry spokesman Mark Miner said. "Just like we did in 2003, we’ll cut spending and take measures to balance the budget." The upshot: Perry’s correct for the moment in that the state has socked away billions in the Economic Stabilization Fund. But his surplus claim implies Texas is awash in cash — suggesting at least enough to continue government operations. He knows better. We rate Perry’s statement as Barely True. Update: The description above of how money can be spent from the so-called rainy day fund reflects a clarification from what we originally posted. In the 2011 session, Lawmakers will legally be permitted to dip into the fund for any reason by two-thirds' votes of the House and Senate. If they're faced with revenue running short of what's needed to fund the current (2010-11) budget, they can take money from the fund by getting three-fifths' votes of each body. The same reduced threshold applies to tapping the fund if state revenue for the 2012-13 fiscal years is projected to run short of revenue that comes in during 2010-11. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.

pomt-07181	"Every year the state loses 8,000-10,000 acres of land in bear country."	half-true	/new-jersey/statements/2011/jun/10/new-jersey-sierra-club/new-jersey-sierra-club-claims-state-loses-8000-100/	The ongoing dispute between the New Jersey Sierra Club and state officials goes beyond whether the state should host another bear hunt this year. It’s also about how they each define "bear country." To the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection, "bear country" refers to where the December 2010 hunt took place in seven northern New Jersey counties. To New Jersey Sierra Club Director Jeff Tittel, "bear country" extends to bear habitats in points further south. The questions surrounding "bear country" stem from the Sierra Club’s recent comments regarding habitat loss. In a press release opposing another hunt this year, the Sierra Club offered a list of ways to manage New Jersey’s bear population, including "protecting habitat." "Every year the state loses 8,000-10,000 acres of land in bear country," according to a May 17 press release. "The more we build houses in the middle of the woods where bears live, the more conflict we will see between bears and humans." That estimate of acreage loss caught the attention of PolitiFact New Jersey, especially since New Jersey is the most densely populated state in the country. Whether the Sierra Club’s numbers are accurate hinges on that original question -- where is "bear country?" First, let’s start with how the Sierra Club arrived at its habitat loss figures. Tittel told us in an email that the Sierra Club’s estimate was based on annual land losses compiled through the the Grant F. Walton Center for Remote Sensing and Spatial Analysis at Rutgers University. In his email, Tittel said the Sierra Club looked at the "Northern and Western Counties of NJ that have Bears." By acres lost, Tittel said he was referring to acres developed and fragmented by development, such as the impacts to the edge of a forested area. But when PolitiFact New Jersey examined the recent research done by the center, the Sierra Club’s numbers didn’t add up -- at least when looking at the seven counties where the 2010 bear hunt occurred. Between 2002 and 2007, the combined urban growth in those seven counties totaled 4,780 acres per year -- not the 8,000-to-10,000 figure cited by the Sierra Club, according to a July 2010 report from the center director and another professor. But the total impact on bear habitat goes beyond just the number of acres developed, said Rowan University associate professor John Hasse, who co-authored the July 2010 report. Each acre developed affects wildlife habitat in the surrounding area, Hasse said. The Sierra Club misfired in terms of growth where the 2010 bear hunt occurred, but Tittel told PolitiFact New Jersey that "bear country" -- there’s that phrase again! -- is larger than where the hunt took place. Tittel argued that sizable bear populations also exist in four other counties not included in the 2010 hunt. When combining the annual growth rates in those counties with the figures from the counties where the 2010 hunt occurred, the new total is 8,806 acres per year, according to the center’s report. "Bear Country is where there are (breeding) populations and good habitat, not where there is a hunt," Tittel wrote in a May 23 email. But DEP spokesman Larry Ragonese said "bear country" should be defined as where last year’s hunt occurred. The bear population has been the most predominant in northwest New Jersey, he said. Yet DEP records back up Tittel’s point that bears can be found outside of where the hunt was held. Bears can find suitable habitats in southern parts of New Jersey, and the most recent DEP statistics show bear activity in seven counties not included in the 2010 hunt. Despite the questions surrounding acreage loss estimates, the Sierra Club correctly states that habitat loss will lead to greater conflicts between bears and humans. Development creates easier access to food for the bruins, increasing their birth rate and survivability, said Larry Katz, a professor of animal sciences at Rutgers University. "We move into an area and we create more habitat," Katz said. "They’re not frightened off by us." Before we give the Sierra Club its rating on the Truth-O-Meter, let’s remember something about all that land being lost to development -- construction activity has taken a sharp downturn in New Jersey and across the country. According to a report prepared by the New Jersey Department of Labor & Workforce Development, the number of residential building permits authorized in New Jersey decreased by about 50 percent from 25,400 in 2007 to 12,396 in 2009. Back to the Sierra Club’s statement, let’s review: The environmental organization said between 8,000 and 10,000 acres annually is lost to development in "bear country," citing the research done by the Grant F. Walton Center for Remote Sensing and Spatial Analysis. But in the counties where the 2010 bear hunt was held, the center’s research pegged growth at 4,780 acres per year. When you throw in figures from other counties mentioned by Tittel, the acreage loss fits within the 8,000-10,000 range in the Sierra Club’s original statement. State records show bear activity in counties outside of last year’s hunting areas. One professor acknowledged that the loss of bear habitat goes beyond the number of acres developed. The Sierra Club’s underlying point -- habitat loss leads to more bear-human conflicts -- also is in line with the perspective of an animal sciences professor. Still, the Sierra Club’s argument about the pace of development is undercut by the decline in construction activity statewide. We rate the statement Half True.

" The Oct. 21 article, posted to NewsPunch.com, shows a photo of Soros photoshopped onto a crowd of people. The article’s headline claims, "Soros Letter Reveals Plot to ‘Take Down Borders’ with Migrant Caravan Invasions," in reference to the nearly 7,000 people making their way to the United States-Mexican border that originated in Honduras two weeks ago. This story was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The post received over 900 interactions and been shared over 280 times, CrowdTangle data show. The blog post’s author is listed as "Thomas Williams," who has also authored recent posts like, "Doctor Blows Whistle on ‘Disastrous’ Flu Shot – ‘It’s Designed to Spread Cancer,’" published Oct. 20. No contact info for Thomas Williams is displayed on the site, and a domain lookup does not reveal who the website is registered to. The article claims that, "As the Left continues to lose the battle for America’s soul, its greatest champions are going all-out in an attempt to turn the tide any way they can – even if it means destroying the country." The author cites a November 2015 Breitbart London article as proof of Soros’ goal of "wiping out all national borders." NewsPunch claims that Soros said this "following an accusation made last week" by Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban. NewsPunch is taking Soros’ statement from 2015 out of context. In October 2015, Orban accused Soros of being part of a group of "activists" that "weakens nation states." "These activists who support immigrants inadvertently become part of this international human-smuggling network," Bloomberg Business reported Orban saying at the time. In response, Soros emailed a statement to Bloomberg Business, defending his position. Orban’s plan, Soros wrote at the time, "treats the protection of national borders as the objective and the refugees as an obstacle. Our plan treats the protection of refugees as the objective and national borders as the obstacle." In his statement, Soros doesn’t say his goal is "wiping out all national borders," like NewsPunch claims. Soros, who was born in Hungary to a Jewish family and lived through the Nazi invasion, does give financial support to organizations that provide legal assistance to immigrants seeking asylum. As a student at the London School of Economics in 1947, Soros studied the work and philosophy of Karl Popper, author of "The Open Society and its Enemies." As Soros wrote in a lecture he delivered at the Central European University in 2009 and later published as part of a book, he was attracted to the notion that the truth is not the domain of any one ideology: "Ideologies that claim to be in possession of the ultimate truth are making a false claim; therefore, they can be imposed on society only by compulsion. All such ideologies lead to repression. Popper proposed a more attractive form of social organization: an open society in which people are free to hold divergent opinions and the rule of law allows people with different views and interests to live together in peace. Having lived through both German and Russian occupation here in Hungary, I found the idea of an open society immensely attractive." That is not the same thing as supporting the destruction of national borders. The NewsPunch article is nearly identical to a Nov. 6, 2015, Natural News article titled, "George Soros letter reveals globalist plan to destroy the First World by eliminating national borders with global migrant blitzkreig invasions." However, included in the NewsPunch article is a screenshot from a video that has gone viral after being tweeted by Rep. Matt Gaetz, R-Fla., on Oct. 17. 2018. The video depicts cash being handed out to people, and NewsPunch included a screenshot of it with the caption "A man pays members of the migrant caravan in cash." Gaetz claimed the footage was from Honduras and mentions Soros in his tweet, writing "Time to investigate the source!" As PolitiFact has reported, the footage is from Chiquimula, Guatemala, not Honduras, and shot outside a store that sells auto parts. Bloggers have falsely claimed that the migration was funded by Democrats. Open Society Foundations, an international grantmaking network founded by Soros in 1979, denied Gaetz’s claim that Soros or his philanthropies are funding the migration. "Neither Mr. Soros nor Open Society are funding this effort. We do support the historic U.S. commitment to welcoming people fleeing oppression and violence in their homelands," Open Society Foundations wrote in an Oct. 18 tweet. Our ruling NewsPunch claimed that Soros’ 2015 statement to Bloomberg Business in response to Orban’s accusations, "Reveals Plot to ‘Take Down Borders’ with Migrant Caravan Invasions." The blog post is conflating a three-year-old statement made by Soros with the current migration to the United States-Mexico border, attempting to draw a connection between the two that isn’t there.

pomt-06530	"Not a single banker, a CEO from Wall Street, anyone from corporate America — nobody, (there was) not one arrest of any of these people who brought down the economy in 2008."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/oct/07/michael-moore/no-ceos-have-been-arrested-bringing-down-economy-s/	Protests under the slogan "Occupy Wall Street" have spread from New York to cities across the United States, and their common theme is expressing anger at an unjust economic system. But Occupy Wall Street isn't your typical protest action. The group has no list of demands, and it says it has no leaders. Rather, people are organizing through social media and making decisions by consensus. Protesters say they're following the model of Egyptian protesters and others who were part of the Arab Spring. An Occupy Wall Street website proclaims, "This site has nothing to do with us." But it also states the one thing protesters have in common: "We are the 99% that will no longer tolerate the greed and corruption of the 1%." Independent filmmaker Michael Moore recently spoke to protesters in Lower Manhattan, and then discussed the movement on Amy Goodman's Democracy Now radio show. She asked Moore what he thought of police arrests of the protesters. Here's what Moore had to say: "Well, it's highly ironic that now over 100 of the protesters have been arrested and not a single banker, a CEO from Wall Street, anyone from corporate America — nobody, not one arrest of any of these people who brought down the economy in 2008. Who created schemes, financial schemes that not only destroyed the economy, but took away the future of this generation, of this young man and his children in the future. They have completely ruined it for people while they have become filthy rich. Not one of them arrested, but 100 of these people who have stood up non-violently against this madness, and they're arrested? This just boggles the mind." We read the same sentiment repeated on Twitter from people supporting the Occupy Wall Street movement's protests. We've noticed news reports before that have noted a general lack of prosecutions. But we wanted to know if Moore and others were right that not a single banker or corporate executive had been arrested. So we decided to check it out. To summarize our findings, we found a few prosecutions, but not many. And we wouldn't describe the targets as the people who were responsible for bringing down the economy. The most notable prosecutions If you're looking for arrests and prosecutions against executives associated with the biggest banks, you won't find them. And we found no arrests of execs with the firms most widely associated with the financial crisis such as Countrywide, AIG or Lehman Brothers. The highest-profile convictions we found were from Taylor, Bean & Whitaker, which was a mortgage lending firm based not on Wall Street, but in Ocala, Fla. Its former chairman, Lee B. Farkas, was convicted of directing nearly $3 billion in fraud that put thousands out of work and contributed to the collapse of Colonial Bank. The collapse was the sixth-largest bank collapse in U.S. history. A judge sentenced Farkas to 30 years in prison on June 30, 2011. Several other executives associated with the firm pleaded guilty in related cases. There were also criminal charges brought against two hedge fund managers at Bear Stearns, who were accused of lying to investors and put on trial for securities fraud. But a jury acquitted them in 2009, and the two men were mid-level managers, not top executives. There have been many other prosecutions of mortgage fraud and insider trading. The U.S. Justice Department pointed us to its StopFraud.gov website, and sent us a long list of other ongoing actions against mortgage fraud, investment fraud, insider trading and other corporate offenses. But the cases have not involved the highly prominent executives Moore described as bringing down the U.S. economy. (We contacted Moore for comment but did not hear back.) Why not more prosecutions? In reviewing the research and talking to experts about why there have not been more prosecutions associated with the financial crisis, we found several reasons. For one thing, such cases tend to be difficult, and it's not immediately clear what offenses executives could be charged with. "You can't get up in front of a jury and say, 'These guys were responsible for bringing down the economy, so please convict them of a crime,'" said Samuel Buell, a professor of law at Duke University, who studies criminal law and the regulation of corporations and financial markets. Criminal intent can be particularly hard to prove, and federal officials may be struggling to bring specific charges against individuals who believed they were following the law. Buell dismissed the idea that the Obama administration is simply indifferent to corporate crime. "There's no downside to putting a few people in prison and showing you're tough on corporate crime," he said. "You can only imagine that would be a political benefit to this administration, which makes me think the only thing holding them back is problems of proof. The last thing they would want to do is bring a big, splashy case against the banks, and then lose and be called incompetent." William Black, a professor of law at the University of Missouri-Kansas City School of Law who studies elite financial fraud, was involved in a string of successful prosecutions against savings and loan officials back in the 1980s. He said the problem now is that financial regulators are not working closely enough with prosecutors to investigate and bring charges against executives. "It is hard, and it does take resources, and it takes expertise in fraud mechanisms so you can explain it to a jury," Black said. "But this is frankly easier than the savings and loan crisis. There's nothing complicated about a liar's loan." Black said that back in the 1980s, financial regulators routinely referred information to prosecutors to prosecute savings and loan executives. That hasn't happened this time around. Earlier this year, the New York Times published a detailed report on why there have not been more high-profile prosecutions; it's the single best report we've seen on the issue. Its investigation found stark differences between how prosecutors and regulators handled the S&L crisis and how the same authorities are handling the current crisis. (See this chart comparing the two eras.) It also included a list of potential crimes suggested by legal experts outside of the federal government. As we were looking into this issue, President Barack Obama spoke about whether federal efforts have been strong enough when it comes to prosecuting crimes associated with the financial crisis. Jake Tapper of ABC News asked him to respond to the Occupy Wall Street protesters and their anger that the Obama administration hasn't been more aggressive with prosecutions. "One of the biggest problems about the collapse of Lehmans and the subsequent financial crisis and the whole subprime lending fiasco is that a lot of that stuff wasn't necessarily illegal, it was just immoral or inappropriate or reckless. That's exactly why we needed to pass Dodd-Frank, to prohibit some of these practices," Obama said. (Dodd-Frank was an overhaul of the finance industry that Obama signed into law on July 21, 2010.) "The financial sector is very creative, and they are always looking for ways to make money. That's their job. And if there are loopholes and rules that can be bent and arbitrage to be had, they will take advantage of it. So without commenting on particular prosecutions -- obviously that's not my job; that's the Attorney General's job -- I think part of people's frustrations, part of my frustration, was a lot of practices that should not have been allowed weren't necessarily against the law, but they had a huge destructive impact. And that's why it was important for us to put in place financial rules that protect the American people from reckless decision-making and irresponsible behavior." Our ruling Moore said, "Not a single banker, a CEO from Wall Street, anyone from corporate America — nobody, (there was) not one arrest of any of these people who brought down the economy in 2008." Well, there have been a few arrests. Certainly the executives of Taylor, Bean & Whitaker who were arrested would qualify as "corporate America." But Moore's larger point is correct -- there have been very few arrests among executives of firms the public would associate with causing the financial crisis. Obama implied in his recent remarks that it was because many of their actions weren't criminal. Whatever the cause, we rate Moore's statement Mostly True.

pomt-12571	Before the presidential campaign, "I didn't know Steve (Bannon)."	pants on fire!	/truth-o-meter/statements/2017/apr/12/donald-trump/did-he-or-didnt-he-trump-contradicts-himself-wheth/	President Donald Trump wavered in his support for White House aide and strategist Steve Bannon in an interview with The New York Post on Tuesday, following stories of a rift forming between Bannon and Trump’s son-in-law, Jared Kushner. "I like Steve, but you have to remember he was not involved in my campaign until very late," Trump said. "I had already beaten all the senators and all the governors, and I didn’t know Steve. I’m my own strategist, and it wasn’t like I was going to change strategies because I was facing crooked Hillary. "Steve is a good guy, but I told them to straighten it out or I will," Trump said. Trump "didn’t know Steve"? That’s an altogether different story than Trump told when he first hired Bannon, a former top editor at the conservative website Breitbart, onto his campaign staff last fall. It also directly contradicts the public record. Trump announced the hiring of Bannon and adviser Kellyanne Conway as part of the Trump campaign on Aug. 17, 2016. Here’s what he said at that time: "I have known Steve and Kellyanne both for many years. They are extremely capable, highly qualified people who love to win and know how to win," Trump said. "I believe we’re adding some of the best talents in politics, with the experience and expertise needed to defeat Hillary Clinton in November and continue to share my message and vision to Make America Great Again. I am committed to doing whatever it takes to win this election, and ultimately become President because our country cannot afford four more years of the failed Obama-Clinton policies which have endangered our financial and physical security." So, in Trump’s own words he either "didn’t know Steve," or he has "known Steve … for many years." One of those claims is clearly wrong. Rebecca Berg of RealClearPolitics provides the answer. She reported the day after Bannon’s hiring by the campaign that Bannon first met Trump in 2011, when Trump was considering whether to challenge President Barack Obama in 2012. In later years, Bannon hosted a radio program in which Trump was a frequent guest, Berg reported. "As Breitbart grew, Mr. Trump was constantly in touch with Steve about news articles and doing interviews with his reporters," David Bossie, president of the conservative advocacy nonprofit Citizens United, told RealClearPolitics. The Washington Post counted nine times that Trump appeared as a guest on Bannon's radio show. That version of events is corroborated by The New Yorker. "In 2011, David Bossie, the head of the conservative group Citizens United, introduced Trump to Bannon; at the time, Trump was thinking about running against Obama. Bannon and Trump met at Trump Tower and discussed a possible campaign. Trump decided against the idea, but the two kept in touch, and Bannon gave Trump admiring coverage. Bannon noticed that, when Trump spoke to crowds, people were electrified. Bannon began to think that Trump might be "the one" who could shake up American politics." Reporters who covered the Trump campaign were puzzled by Trump's retelling of events. "Trump claiming he didn't know Bannon till late in campaign is flatly untrue," tweeted Maggie Haberman of the New York Times. Added McKay Coppins of The Atlantic: "Just for the record: Trump is pretty blatantly not telling the truth when he says he didn't know Bannon until late in the campaign." We've reached out to the White House and will update this post if we hear back. Our ruling Trump said that before the presidential campaign, "I didn’t know Steve," referring to Steve Bannon. That’s contradicted by Trump’s own words and independent reporting. We rate this claim Pants on Fire.

pomt-12580	"Last month, we saw a 64 percent reduction in illegal immigration on our southern border."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2017/apr/10/donald-trump/trump-illegal-immigration-down-64-percent-march-tr/	President Donald Trump says the country is continuing to make "historic progress" to curb the flow of illegal immigration along the southern border. "We inherited a full-fledged border crisis. It was a disaster," Trump said in his weekly radio address April 7. "Yet, with quick and bold steps, we have so far exceeded even the most bullish predictions for the progress we could make in so short a period of time. Last month, we saw a 64 percent reduction in illegal immigration on our southern border." It wasn’t the first time Trump claimed he inherited a mess, or that he’s turned things around at the border. He’s recently emphasized statistics to show decreases in illegal immigration. In March, he said illegal immigration was down 61 percent since Election Day (Mostly True) and down 40 percent since his first month in office (Mostly True). Is Trump’s story getting even better? What we found is that Trump is changing how he's doing the counting in a way that emphasizes progress. The ‘64 percent reduction’ To get to the 64 percent reduction, Trump isn’t looking at the decrease from February 2017 to March 2017, as he did when he talked about the decrease between January and February. Instead, he’s looking at the year-over-year reduction (March 2016 vs. March 2017), the White House told us. U.S. Customs and Border Protection data show that in March 2017 border patrol made 12,193 apprehensions at the southwest border. In March 2016, there were 33,316 apprehensions. That’s a 63.4 percent decrease year-over-year. Add in people who were deemed inadmissable to the country and you reach 64 percent. But if you looked at the decrease from February 2017 to March 2017, as Trump did last month, the drop would not have been as dramatic. From February 2017 to March 2017, border patrol apprehensions dropped about 35 percent, not 64 percent. Point being, Trump picked the number that showed the biggest decrease, when last month he calculated the figure a different way. Importantly, a listener to Trump's weekly radio address would have no way of knowing Trump changed his measuring stick. Aside from the specific numbers, Trump’s rhetoric and tough immigration stance can be credited for the decreases, experts have told us. But they caution against making early conclusions about the effect Trump’s policies have had. Changes on the ground usually take longer to materialize, experts said. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com Oh, Canada? While data backs Trump’s claim of decreases at the U.S.-Mexico border, the northern border has actually seen an increase in illegal immigration. "As we increasingly secure the southern border, won't that put more pressure on the northern border and other ports of entry?" Sen. John Hoeven, R-N.D., asked John Kelly, Department of Homeland Security secretary, during an April 5 Senate committee hearing on border security and public safety. Kelly said security concerns were not at the same level in the northern border as they are in the southern border. But that sector also needs attention, he said. "We obviously need to watch it, one of the things the Canadians recently did was to allow ... Mexicans to travel to Canada without visas and we're seeing a little bit of increase in Mexicans coming illegally into the United States from the north," Kelly said. (Since Dec. 1, 2016 Mexicans do not need a visa to visit Canada.) In all fiscal year 2016, there were 2,283 border patrol apprehensions at the northern border, compared to 408,870 at the southern border. Our ruling Trump said, "Last month, we saw a 64 percent reduction in illegal immigration on our southern border." It depends on how you define last month. The White House said Trump was speaking about year-over-year changes, from March 2016 to March 2017. Border patrol apprehensions declined 63.4 percent during that time.

pomt-12597	"Finally, I will continue to fight against Republicans like Martina White, who like Trump, wants to deport all of our hard working immigrant brothers and sisters and white wash America."	pants on fire!	/pennsylvania/statements/2017/apr/05/brian-sims/philly-rep-sims-martina-white-wants-deport-all-imm/	Not long after squaring off against Pa. Rep. Martina White in a Fox 29 debate over sanctuary cities last week, Rep. Brian Sims sent a fundraising message attacking her further. "Finally," the message read, "I will continue to fight against Republicans like Martina White, who like Trump, wants to deport all of our hard working immigrant brothers and sisters and white wash America." "All" immigrants? Has White ever suggested she wanted to deport every immigrant? This is a quick fact-check. In short, White has not suggested this, something Sims spokesperson Dan Siegel acknowledged in a phone conversation, admitting that White had never said it. She hasn’t introduced or supported any legislation that would lead to the deportation of all immigrants, either. White’s discussion of any policy involving immigration has mostly been limited to sanctuary cities. Last week, she reintroduced a bill that would strip hundreds of millions in state funding from Philadelphia if it continues to not fully cooperate with federal immigration officials as part of its sanctuary city status. She emphasized in a statement responding to Sims’ fundraising message she supports legal immigration and has never suggested all immigrants be deported. "I find it disgusting that Rep. Sims would try to raise money by blatantly lying about me and using such derogatory terms about a fellow legislator," she said. "The fact is that I fully support and welcome legal immigration, and - as a state Representative - I do not weigh in on federal government policy regarding undocumented immigrants presently in our country. "My concern is rogue public officials who violate federal law to further their own agendas. Perhaps Rep. Sims should spend more time focusing on protecting the people of Philadelphia and upholding the law he took an oath to follow instead of lying and playing politics." Siegel compared White to Trump, pointing out the similarities of her sanctuary cities bill and the president’s executive order threatening to slash federal funding from sanctuary cities. "I think it’s fair to say that she views an America that is very homogeneous," Siegel said, "and I think her actions have shown that she doesn’t have a whole lot of respect for folks who have come to this country and tried to build a life here." Our ruling Rep. Brian Sims claimed in a fundraising message fellow state Rep. Martina White "wants to deport all of our hard working immigrant brothers and sisters and white wash America." White has never said anything like this or supported legislation that could lead to the deportation of all immigrants. A spokesperson for Sims acknowledged White had not said this, and White said she supported legal immigration. This isn’t the first time Sims stretched the truth in a fundraising message. Last spring, while asking for donations, he claimed "right-wing extremists" were trying to take his seat, though no Republicans were running for his seat and his Democratic competitors were similarly progressive.

pomt-04379	"I’ve got a 94 percent" career voting record in Congress while Bill Nelson has "a 92 percent voting record."	true	/florida/statements/2012/oct/19/connie-mack/connie-mack-says-his-career-voting-participation-p/	U.S. Rep. Connie Mack IV, R-Fort Myers, has been the target of attacks for missing votes while campaigning for Senate this year. In a debate against his Democratic opponent Sen. Bill Nelson on Oct. 17, 2012, Mack defended himself by saying that his career voting record was on par with Nelson’s. Mack started in Congress in 2005, while Nelson served in the House between 1979 and 1990 and then joined the Senate in 2001. Here’s what they said at the debate: Nelson: "Speaking of votes why don’t you explain how you don’t show up to work? Why don’t you explain how this year you have one of the worst voting records. I have missed one vote this year. You have missed 178...." Mack: "As far as my voting record, Senator, you should be straight with people. I’ve got a 94 percent voting record. You’ve got a 92 percent voting record." We will fact-check Mack’s claim that he’s got "a 94 percent voting record" for his career in Congress, while Bill Nelson has "a 92 percent voting record." Missed votes in 2012 This fight over voting records started earlier in the debate when Nelson claimed that he only missed one vote while Mack missed 178, which meant he has "one of the worst voting records." We ruled that claim Mostly True; we’ll briefly recap our findings. GovTrack.us tracks missed votes for members of Congress using voting information from the official websites of the U.S. House of Representatives and Senate. It shows that for the first three quarters of this year, Mack missed 178 votes. Nelson’s one missed vote this year was to confirm the nomination of a federal judge in Illinois, which passed 86-1 on May 14. Mack’s missed votes for this year put him in 13th place for members of Congress who have missed the most votes during the past two years, according to the New York Times’ Inside Congress database. But it’s no surprise that Mack missed more votes than Nelson this year. While Nelson had token primary opposition, Mack faced serious primary challengers. In July, Mack campaign spokesman David James said that Mack missed votes "to make sure Mitt Romney won the Florida presidential primary in January, something Connie's constituents felt very strongly about when it comes to invoking the change we need in Washington." Missed votes throughout career Looking at sheer vote numbers isn’t an apples-to-apples comparison because the House takes more votes than the Senate. So we also looked at the percentage of missed votes for Mack’s tenure and Nelson’s Senate tenure. From the start of Mack’s tenure in January 2005, he missed 6 percent of roll call votes -- that’s how Mack can claim that he has a 94 percent voting record. During Nelson’s Senate tenure starting in January 2001, he missed 1 percent. The median missed votes for all members was 2.5 percent. But Mack’s claim that Nelson had a 92 percent voting record -- or missed 8 percent of votes -- refers to his term in the House (1979-1990) plus his term in the Senate starting in 2001. Here’s why Mack likes to throw in those earlier years for Nelson: When Nelson campaigned for governor in 1990, he missed 56 percent of his votes. Mack campaign consultant Gary Maloney sent us a spreadsheet showing Nelson’s missed votes and his voting participation rate each year based on Congressional Quarterly data. According to that data, Nelson participated about 92 percent of the time. We contacted CQ directly, and they could not immediately verify the raw number of votes but did provide the percentage of missed votes each year, and that averaged out to about 92 percent, too. (Note that averaging the percentage each year isn’t a true average, because the total number of votes changed each year, but it likely provides a close approximation.) We sent our findings to the Nelson campaign and they did not dispute the numbers. Our ruling Mack said that his own career voting participation rate is 94 percent, while Nelson’s is 92 percent. The available data supports those numbers. Both candidates have political reasons for times when they missed votes: Nelson missed more than half of his votes in 1990 when he ran for governor. Mack missed about 30 percent so far this year running for Senate. So while Nelson criticized Mack for missed votes this year, Nelson has also missed votes in the past, and their career voting rates are roughly equivalent. We rate this claim True.

pomt-07686	"Secretly, unbeknownst to members of Congress, over $105 billion was hidden in the Obamacare legislation."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/mar/08/michele-bachmann/michele-bachmann-charges-health-care-bill-spent-10/	Tea party favorite Michele Bachmann used a recent appearance on Meet the Press to attack the health care law for what she said was secret spending. "It is shocking the revelations of all the money that's been spent," said Bachmann, R-Minn. "There is a Congressional Research Service report that just was issued in February, and we discovered that secretly, unbeknownst to members of Congress, over $105 billion was hidden in the Obamacare legislation to fund the implementation of Obamacare. This is something that wasn't known." Just in case you missed her point, she said the number "$105 billion" seven more times, and waved a sign that said "$105,464,000,000." Readers e-mailed us immediately, asking us to fact-check whether it was true. We contacted Bachmann’s office to ask where she got the number, but we didn’t get a response. So we turned to a February report from the Congressional Research Service titled, "Appropriations and Fund Transfers in the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA)." The $105 billion To explain the report’s findings, we should first tell you a little bit about how federal spending works when it comes to authorizations versus appropriations. Laws can either authorize money to be spent, appropriate money, or both authorize and appropriate. An authorization means it’s legally permissible to spend money on a particular program; an appropriation actually supplies the money. The real power lies in appropriation. House members like Bachmann had hoped to stop the new health care law by simply refusing to fund it with appropriations. What they’re finding out, though, is that doing so won’t shut the money spigot entirely, since the law already included some appropriations and transfers from other sources when it passed. The CRS report detailed the programs that received funding in the bill. (Fund transfers work a little differently than appropriations, but the important thing for analyzing Bachmann’s comment is that they both provided immediate funding.) The CRS report doesn’t add up all the numbers, but we did, and we got $104 billion -- very close to Bachmann’s number. A few programs are funded contingent on adjustments for inflation, so the grand total can vary a bit. The largest chunk of funding, $40 billion, went to the state Children’s Health Insurance Program, to fund it for 2014 and 2015. (Soon after President Barack Obama took office in 2009, Democrats approved funding through 2013.) A new Prevention and Public Health Fund -- a state-based effort aimed at preventing chronic disease -- got the second biggest chunk, $15 billion over 10 years. The Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation got $10 billion over 10 years to test payment and service-delivery models that might reduce health care spending and improve care. The "shocking" revelation But is that $105 billion a "shocking" revelation -- something that "wasn’t known" and passed "secretly, unbeknownst to members of Congress"? Bachmann has a point if you look at the amount of media coverage the appropriations and transfers inspired. There was hardly any. Using a variety of terms to search the Nexis database, we found only one document that explained in any detail how the health care bill included appropriations and transfers -- a news release by the conservative Heritage Foundation that raised an alarm about abortion funding. The bill, Heritage said, would "directly appropriate $7 billion over five years in operating funds for (federally qualified health centers) ... funds (that) would not need to be included in the annual appropriations bill for the Department of Labor and HHS." But Bachmann didn’t say that the media failed to pay attention; she went further, charging that the provisions were passed "secretly, unbeknownst to members of Congress." We find that contention questionable. We poked around the versions of the health care law that were up for consideration and found older versions that included both appropriations and fund transfers, some of which made it to the final bill. The CRS report Bachmann cited may have compiled the appropriated funding information into an easy-to-understand format, but it’s not as if the spending was approved secretly. Steve Ellis of the nonpartisan Taxpayers for Common Sense said it was no secret: the Congressional Budget Office -- Congress’ nonpartisan budget-analysis agency -- extensively detailed the spending in the bill. "I’m not saying that everybody knew everything that was in the health care bill, because it’s almost impossible to do that. But it was documented that the money was in there," Ellis said. "Shame on them if they didn’t know that." We asked experts in federal budgeting whether the health care bill’s use of appropriations in an authorizing bill was unusual. They said it was not. "Congress has routinely provided appropriations in authorization bills, for multiple years of availability, and has also routinely transferred funds from one account to another," said Roy T. Meyers, a former CBO analyst and now a political scientist at the University of Maryland at Baltimore County. We should also note that versions of the health care law were posted to the Internet for 72 hours before a vote was held. That’s not a lot of time, but it’s far from a secret process, said Gabriela Schneider of the Sunlight Foundation, a nonprofit that urges greater government openness and transparency. "At the time, we commended Congress for taking an unprecedented step and Speaker Pelosi for making sure every version of the health care bill was posted online 72 hours before consideration," she said. The process worked well, Schneider said, and House Republicans have subsequently adopted the 72-hour window. "It's a bill -- the text is public!" said Alec Vachon, a former Republican congressional staffer who’s now a health care consultant. "Is Congresswoman Bachmann saying there are no House Republicans, members or staff, who can read a bill?" One final point: Contrary to the implication of Bachmann’s comments, the spending provisions in the health care bill are not written in stone. "Congress can always revisit the spending decisions, including entitlement and direct spending, of past Congresses," said Donald Wolfensberger, a former Republican aide to the House Rules Committee. Our conclusion Bachmann said that "secretly, unbeknownst to members of Congress, over $105 billion was hidden in the Obamacare legislation." She’s right that there’s about $105 billion of already approved spending in the health care bill that may be difficult to rescind. But that does not mean that the process was secret. While the pre-approved spending provisions didn’t attract media attention, they were in the plain language of the bill and did not vary dramatically from past congressional practice. And the bill was made public before the vote. On balance, we rate Bachmann’s statement Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.	None	Michele Bachmann	None	None	None	2011-03-08T16:17:22	2011-03-06	['United_States_Congress']
pomt-12207	"According to a recent study from the University of California Riverside, (sanctuary) cities with these policies have more violent crime on average than those that don’t."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2017/jul/24/jeff-sessions/jeff-sessions-mischaracterizes-study-sanctuary-cit/	Attorney General Jeff Sessions told law enforcement officers that cities with policies protecting immigrants have more violent crime and attributed the conclusion to a university study. "When cities like Philadelphia, Boston, or San Francisco advertise that they have these (‘sanctuary city’) policies, the criminals take notice," Sessions said July 12 in Las Vegas. "According to a recent study from the University of California Riverside, cities with these policies have more violent crime on average than those that don’t." Local jurisdictions that limit their cooperation with federal immigration officers are commonly called "sanctuary cities." There isn’t one particular policy followed by all jurisdictions, and the extent and situations in which they restrict cooperation varies nationwide. Sessions said there were "some 300 jurisdictions" refusing to cooperate with federal immigration authorities and that they were "protecting criminals rather than their law-abiding residents." Data and research on so-called sanctuary cities and their impact on crime is limited. So we were curious about Sessions' citation of a university study. It turns out Sessions’ effort to use research to back his claim got some bad grades from the professors. Study researchers disputed Sessions’ conclusion of their work and said they were unaware of other studies supporting the attorney general’s claim. Here we will lay out the study, Sessions’ assessment and the researchers’ response. Sanctuary cities and studies on their policies President Donald Trump opposes sanctuary cities, contending they are a haven for criminal immigrants. He routinely cites as an example the death of Kate Steinle, a San Francisco woman whom authorities say was fatally shot by an immigrant in the country illegally who had been previously deported five times. Trump campaigned on a promise to cut federal funding for sanctuary cities, hoping that the threat of losing money will make them assist federal authorities. A judge has blocked Trump’s executive order toward this end, but a House bill for this measure passed in June. We’ve fact-checked many claims on sanctuary cities and public safety. Experts routinely tell us there isn’t abundant research specifically about sanctuary cities and their impact on crime. Sanctuary ordinances have been around for decades, but only until recently have social scientists studied their effect on crime rates, Elizabeth F. Cohen, an associate professor of political science at Syracuse University, told us for a previous fact-check on a claim of studies showing sanctuary cities "do not lead to an increase in crime because of the presence of people that are undocumented." Study cited by Sessions Researchers from the study Sessions cited found that sanctuary policies do not affect crime rates either way. The study analyzed crime data from jurisdictions that "expressly forbid city officials or police departments from inquiring into immigration status" and analyzed it in two methods. First, researchers compared cities’ crime rate in the year before and the year after a policy’s implementation. In the second approach, they "matched each sanctuary city to a similarly situated non-sanctuary city based on relevant census and political variables," the authors explained in an October 2016 post in the Washington Post’s Monkey Cage blog. At the end, "We find no statistically discernible difference in violent crime rate, rape, or property crime across the cities. Our findings provide evidence that sanctuary policies have no effect on crime rates, despite narratives to the contrary," said the 2016 study, titled "The Politics of Refuge: Sanctuary Cities, Crime, and Undocumented Immigration." The researchers were from the University of California at Riverside and Highline College. Sessions, however, based his claim on one figure in the study that depicted two lines comparing violent crime among sanctuary and non-sanctuary cities between 2000 and 2014. The graph showed that violent crime was higher in sanctuary cities than in non-sanctuary cities. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com (Figure from University of California at Riverside and Highline College study on sanctuary cities.) In a statement, the Justice Department said, "The Attorney General accurately cited data from a study that clearly showed that the violent crime rate was higher in sanctuary cities versus non-sanctuary cities. That is a fact and assertions to the contrary ignore that data." But the text of the study offered a note about the figure. "If the two lines for each year cross each other at any point, then the relationship between violent crime and city-type is not statistically significant," the paper said. "While there is a mild tendency to have slightly more crime in sanctuary cities, these sanctuary cities effects are very small, and are not statistically significant." The study researchers said Sessions ignored additional information in the study. "Without consulting our paper (or piece on the Monkey Cage blog) yes, the graph does appear to show that crime is higher in sanctuary cities," Benjamin Gonzalez-O’Brien, one of the authors of the study told PolitiFact. "However, the vertical lines in the figure represent confidence intervals, which capture statistical uncertainty. Basically, the actual crime rate could be anywhere in that range, from the bottom of the vertical line to the top. Because these confidence intervals are large and overlap with those of non-sanctuary cities, it cannot be said that crime rates in sanctuaries are higher than in non-sanctuaries." The study includes another figure that shows violent crime before and after passage of sanctuary city policies. Post-implementation, some cities had higher crime rates, others had lower rates and others saw no change, according to the study. See Figure 2 on PolitiFact.com (Figure from University of California at Riverside and Highline College study on sanctuary cities.) "If sanctuary policies led to increased crime, then any city that passes one should have a higher crime rate following its passage. This is not the case," Gonzalez-O’Brien said. "Taken together, these two pieces of evidence suggest no relationship between sanctuary status and crime." Gonzalez-O’Brien and colleague Loren Collingwood wrote a blog post for Monkey Cage refuting Sessions’ characterization of their work. It’s headlined, "Jeff Sessions used our research to claim that sanctuary cities have more crime. He’s wrong." Sessions on July 21 also spoke about sanctuary city policies to law enforcement officials in Philadelphia. He did not cite the researchers’ study, according to a copy of the remarks provided by the Justice Department. Our ruling Sessions claimed, "According to a recent study from the University of California Riverside, (sanctuary) cities with these policies have more violent crime on average than those that don’t." Sessions’ claim is based on one figure of the study that does appear to show that violent crime is higher in sanctuary cities. But the researchers say Sessions mischaracterized the findings and failed to consider additional information in the study. Vertical lines in the figure represent confidence intervals and capture statistical uncertainty, one of the researchers said. Another figure in the study also shows that post-sanctuary policies, some cities had higher crime rates, others had lower rates and others saw no change. Overall, the study concluded that sanctuary policies had no effect on crime rates. Sessions’ statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression. We rate it Mostly False. See Figure 3 on PolitiFact.com	None	Jeff Sessions	None	None	None	2017-07-24T10:35:26	2017-07-12	['University_of_California,_Riverside']
pomt-02067	Says Democratic candidate for state school superintendent Alisha Thomas Morgan voted to slash funding for the preschool programs for disabled and special needs students.	half-true	/georgia/statements/2014/may/27/valarie-wilson/georgia-superintendent-candidate-criticizes-oppone/	Educators for several years have lamented state budget cuts to public schools. That’s why it’s likely no surprise that Valarie Wilson, a candidate for state school superintendent, is trying to make political hay of the fact that her opponent and fellow Democrat Alisha Thomas Morgan had a hand in those cuts. In a recent campaign flier, Wilson accused Morgan, her July runoff opponent, of, among other things, voting to slash funding in 2010 for programs to help disabled preschoolers and other special needs students. We wondered whether that was true and decided to crank up the Truth-O-Meter. Wilson, a former chairwoman of the Decatur school board, points out that candidate Morgan touts her role on the House Appropriations education subcommittee and the leverage it gave her. "I am not a legislator," Wilson said. "However, I believe that every vote cast or decision made reflects priorities and values." We scoured state budget documents and were able to confirm that Wilson is technically right. Morgan, a member of the Georgia House since 2003, voted in favor of an amended 2010 state budget that included cuts to the program for disabled preschoolers, as well to a program giving scholarships to special needs students who want to attend private schools. (The amended budget -- House Bill 947 -- passed in 2010, with 122 yes votes, including Morgan’s, and 44 no votes, so an argument could be made that the budget would have passed without Morgan’s vote.) But there’s more to the story. First of all, these cuts were made when Georgia and the nation were in the aftermath of what’s come to be known as the Great Recession. In January 2010, then-Gov. Sonny Perdue was asking lawmakers -- Morgan included -- to cut $1.2 billion out of a budget that had already been in place for six months. Revenue was bleak -- down $136 million, or 8.7 percent, just for that month. The program to help disabled 3- and 4-year-olds be better prepared for school didn’t escape the cutting. Neither did the special needs scholarship program. The $29 million budget for the preschool disabled program was cut about $2 million. About $1 million of that came from furloughing employees and cuts to employer insurance premiums --- something that was done across all of state government. Morgan’s campaign points out that the preschool budget was cut by a smaller percentage, nearly 6.9 percent, than most departments. Records show state spending to pre-school was cut less than many departments, such as Agriculture, Economic Development, Natural Resources and the Regents System. Funding for the private school scholarships was cut $4 million, and officials in the House Budget Office say that was based strictly on the state’s education funding formula. It’s true that the state budget can, in theory, be amended when it hits the floor of either the House or Senate. Rule 108.3 spells out the protocol in the House. "No amendment to any appropriations bill shall be in order if the amendment has the effect of both reducing one appropriation and either increasing another appropriation or adding a new appropriation. No amendment to any appropriations bill increasing any appropriation or adding a new appropriation shall be in order unless there has previously been adopted an amendment reducing some other appropriation so as to make funds available for such new or increased appropriation; and no amendment to any appropriations bill shall be in order which would cause the bill to violate the balanced budget requirements of the Constitution." Longtime observers say floor amendments to the budget have been tried a few times, but rarely. Michael Brewer, Morgan’s deputy campaign manager, said the claims in Wilson’s flier are "intellectually disingenuous, at best." They overlook the tough economic times and the state’s obligation to balance its budget and pay its bills, he said. "Tough choices were made to tighten the state’s belt, so to speak, without raising taxes on Georgia families during the difficult economic recession," Brewer said. "Cuts were made across the board to every state agency and department, and legislators did everything they could to reduce and stymie those cuts to education." In the 2014 state budget approved by lawmakers last year, funding for the preschool disabled program was back to $29 million, the amount it was before the 2010 midyear cuts, he pointed out. Morgan also voted in favor of that budget. In summary, Wilson is correct that Morgan voted for an amended state budget for 2010 that included cuts to the preschool disabled program and a scholarship program for special needs students. But a lot of context is needed to understand the claim. The state was in economic hard times in 2010, and cuts were being ordered across all state agencies, with sign-off from a majority of the General Assembly, not just Morgan. These programs represent a small fraction of the state’s multibillion-dollar annual budget. PolitiFact has encountered many cases where candidates accuse elected officials of supporting cuts without noting that these votes were parts of larger budget decisions. Wilson’s attack against Morgan omits key context. It is accurate but misleading. We rate the statement as Half True.	None	Valarie Wilson	None	None	None	2014-05-27T00:00:00	2014-05-14	['None']
pomt-02305	A Koch brothers group is "going to college campuses, giving away free booze to try to bribe young folks out of getting health insurance."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2014/apr/01/organizing-action/organizing-action-says-koch-brothers-group-used-bo/	"This is some sick crap." So began an Organizing for Action fundraising email. The group attacked David and Charles Koch, the billionaire brothers who support the tea party movement. "This should humiliate anyone who's ever been associated with the Koch brothers," the March 26 email continued. "One of their anti-Obamacare groups is going to college campuses, giving away free booze to try to bribe young folks out of getting health insurance." We wondered if such an education campaign, complete with free alcohol, really existed. The email referred to Generation Opportunity, a national political activist group made up of young conservatives. They’re behind the "Creepy Uncle Sam" ads you may have seen last year. Back in November 2013, the Tampa Bay Times reported on one of their 20 "opt-out" campaign stops at college campuses to educate students about alternatives to buying health insurance on the Affordable Care Act exchanges. At a University of Miami-Virginia Tech football game tailgate, Generation Opportunity set up a DJ, beer pong tables, models and free pizza to draw students in. They handed out free gear with their logo on it -- T-shirts, beer koozies, bottle openers. The one thing they didn’t provide is the beer itself. Spokesman David Pasch said 21+college students brought their own beer to the Miami event and others. However, just off campus near several colleges, Generation Opportunity hosted happy hours where they did give out individual tickets for free drinks to 21+ attendees at places like The Crust, a Williamsburg, Va., pizza place. These events weren’t focused specifically on an anti-Affordable Care Act agenda, but there was free "opt-out swag" on hand, Pasch said. So we know Generation Opportunity did offer free booze to college-aged students at some of their events, but let’s take a closer look at the opt-out campaign. Organizing for Action claimed Generation Opportunity used the campaign to "bribe young folks out of getting health insurance." But Generation Opportunity’s events were open to everyone, Pasch said. Attendees at the tailgates and happy hours didn’t need to swear off the health care reform before snagging a free T-shirt or drink. Also, the campaign’s goal is not to encourage young Americans to go without health care. It’s to get them to look into alternative coverage options to the online marketplaces, such as private plans that still fit the Affordable Care Act’s 10 essential benefit requirements. Those plans still fulfill the law’s individual mandate, which requires everyone to have health insurance. "We never have (and never will) advocate young people forgo health insurance," Pasch said. Our ruling Organizing for Action said Generation Opportunity is "going to college campuses, giving away free booze to try to bribe young folks out of getting health insurance." The Koch brothers-backed group holds Opt-Out events to encourage young people to consider buying health insurance off the Affordable Care Act marketplaces. At some of their education campaign events near college campuses, they did offer free alcohol to entice attendees. At campus events, students brought the booze themselves. Generation Opportunity didn’t bribe students, but they did offer alcohol to young people who wanted to hear about alternatives to the health care reform’s marketplaces.

pomt-14583	Regarding the Iraq War, "I was the one that said, ‘Don’t go, don’t do it, you’re going to destabilize the Middle East.’ "	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/feb/06/donald-trump/donald-trump-overstates-his-early-opposition-iraq-/	Donald Trump says he has the temperament to be president, and his position against the Iraq War proves it. "The War in Iraq — I was the one that said, ‘Don’t go, don’t do it, you’re going to destabilize the Middle East,’ " the Republican front runner said at the Feb. 6, 2016, New Hampshire GOP debate. Several media outlets have cast doubt on Trump’s claim that he spoke out against the Iraq War, pointing out that he didn’t appear to take any public position on the war until after the March 2003 invasion. Because Trump keeps making this kind of claim, we decided to put it on PolitiFact’s Truth-O-Meter. We searched newspaper articles and television transcripts from 2002 and 2003, during the debate leading up to the Iraq War. We didn’t find any examples of Trump unequivocally denouncing the war until a year after the war began. Trump’s comments We only found one instance where Trump discussed the war before it started. On Jan. 28, 2003, just under three months before the invasion, Fox News’ Neil Cavuto asked Trump whether President George W. Bush should be more focused on Iraq or the economy. Speaking of Iraq, Trump said, "Well, he has either got to do something or not do something, perhaps, because perhaps shouldn't be doing it yet and perhaps we should be waiting for the United Nations, you know. He's under a lot of pressure. I think he's doing a very good job. But, of course, if you look at the polls, a lot of people are getting a little tired. I think the Iraqi situation is a problem. And I think the economy is a much bigger problem as far as the president is concerned." Trump seems to be skeptical of the mission in Iraq here, and he said the economy should be a higher priority. But he did not say anything that resembles his claim: that Bush should not proceed because a war would "destabilize the Middle East." The United States invaded Iraq on March 19, 2003. A week later, Trump gave differing takes. At an Academy Awards after party, Trump said that "the war’s a mess," according to the Washington Post. He told Fox News that because of the war, "The market’s going to go up like a rocket." Trump’s harshest criticism came more than a year into the war, in an August 2004 article in Esquire: "Look at the war in Iraq and the mess that we're in. I would never have handled it that way. Does anybody really believe that Iraq is going to be a wonderful democracy where people are going to run down to the voting box and gently put in their ballot and the winner is happily going to step up to lead the country? C'mon. Two minutes after we leave, there's going to be a revolution, and the meanest, toughest, smartest, most vicious guy will take over. And he'll have weapons of mass destruction, which Saddam didn't have. "What was the purpose of this whole thing? Hundreds and hundreds of young people killed. And what about the people coming back with no arms and legs? Not to mention the other side. All those Iraqi kids who've been blown to pieces. And it turns out that all of the reasons for the war were blatantly wrong. All this for nothing!" He told CNN’s Larry King in November 2004, "I do not believe that we made the right decision going into Iraq, but, you know, hopefully, we'll be getting out." Clearly Trump opposed the Iraq War in its early years. There’s no evidence, though, that he advocated against the war in the first place. Our ruling Regarding the Iraq War, "I was the one that said, ‘Don’t go, don’t do it, you’re going to destabilize the Middle East.’ " Maybe Trump felt this way privately, but he made no publicly reported comments in the lead up to the Iraq War that reflect this sentiment. We could only find one example of Trump commenting on the Iraq War before the invasion, and he seemed apprehensive but not vehemently opposed to the operation. He only started publicly denouncing the war after it started. Trump makes it sound like he stood on a railroad to try to stop the Iraq War train in its tracks. In reality, by the time he got around to forcefully criticizing the war, that train had already left the station.

pomt-06774	Democrats failed to flip the Wisconsin state Senate because recall elections were in the "deepest red districts in the state."	mostly false	/wisconsin/statements/2011/aug/19/tammy-baldwin/us-rep-tammy-baldwin-says-wisconsin-state-senate-r/	U.S. Rep. Tammy Baldwin doesn’t pretend that the recall elections on Aug. 9, 2011, were a big victory for Democrats, who narrowly lost their bid to flip partisan control of the Wisconsin state Senate. But the day after the elections, the Madison Democrat, who is positioning herself for a Senate bid in 2012, told a news interviewer on ABC News’ Top Line webcast that the deck was stacked against the Democrats in "deeply red" districts. "Think about the districts that these battles were fought in," Baldwin said. "These are Senate districts that were won by Republicans in 2008, which was a Democratic wave election. So we’re talking about the deepest red districts in the state." She added: "If some of these battles had been fought out in slightly less red districts we would have seen a different thing. But this wasn’t a statewide election." Baldwin’s observations fit the Democratic opinion that winning two of six seats held by incumbent Republican senators was significant progress. (Recalls also were held July 19, 2011 and Aug. 16, 2011, with three Democratic incumbents retaining their seats and leaving the chamber split 17-16 for the GOP). But Baldwin went further by saying the recall turf was "the deepest" red districts in the state. Let’s take a look at her take. Baldwin is correct that all six districts were taken or held by Republican candidates in an abysmal GOP year (2008). Indeed, the six districts, spread across the state, have long Republican traditions -- a fact pointed out by Baldwin’s office when we asked her to back up the claim. One of the districts, represented by Sheila Harsdorf in northwestern Wisconsin, went 58 percent for Republican Scott Walker in the fall 2010 governor’s race. Walker won 57 percent in three of the other recall districts, and 54 percent in a fifth. In the 2008 presidential race, in which Barack Obama swamped Republican John McCain in Wisconsin, the GOP vote in five of the six recall districts was about 5 percentage points higher than the GOP vote statewide. And in those same five districts in the 2010 governor’s race, that advantage was 4 percentage points. (These measures exclude one district that is an outlier; more on that later). So by some important measures, there’s no doubt these are Republican-oriented districts. However, Baldwin claimed these were not just Republican districts, but the "deepest" red ones. We found convincing evidence otherwise in the number-crunching by Journal Sentinel Washington Bureau Chief Craig Gilbert, whose blog, The Wisconsin Voter, regularly digs into statistics-based election analysis. There’s an elite tier of bedrock GOP Senate districts -- but arguably none of the six Baldwin referred to is in that tier, Gilbert’s reporting shows. The deepest red districts are clustered in the suburban-rural ring around Milwaukee or farther out in southeastern Wisconsin. These take in areas of Ozaukee, Washington, Waukesha, Dodge and Walworth counties -- some of the most reliably conservative and Republican sections of the state. One way to examine Senate districts is to look at McCain’s performance. He got only 42 percent statewide, but still managed to carry five districts in the Milwaukee area. That suggests those are even deeper red. And none of those McCain hot spots was among those where recalls took place. In fact, Obama won all of the GOP-recall Senate districts. That would suggest a bit of a blue tint. Or that the districts have swung back and forth over time, depending on the year and the race. Let’s look at the 2010 race between Walker and the Democratic candidate, Milwaukee Mayor Tom Barrett. Five of the recall districts, as we mentioned earlier, went handily for Walker -- giving him 54% to 58% of the vote. But that’s not the whole story. Those margins in the recall districts were right around the median victory margin in GOP-held Senate districts in Walker’s comfortable victory. By contrast, that elite tier of GOP-dominated districts went for Walker by 62 percent to 74 percent, with districts represented by Senate Majority Leader Scott Fitzgerald (R-Juneau) and Glenn Grothman (R-West Bend), respectively, at the two ends of that scale. Finally, there is the "outlier" district we mentioned, the one represented by Republican Dan Kapanke of La Crosse, who fell in the Aug. 9 recall to Democratic state Rep. Jennifer Shilling. That district has voted less Republican than the state as a whole in two recent election years -- including a 61 percent showing by Barack Obama. And Democrats have broken through to represent that seat a couple times over the last half-century. Kapanke’s district split down the middle in the Walker-Barrett race. So Baldwin’s statement is even more off as it relates to that district. We could talk about the numbers until we’re, well, blue in the face. But we’ll end it here: Baldwin said on an ABC News political webcast that the battleground for the Aug. 9, 2011 state Senate recalls was the "deepest" Republican districts in the state. There’s an element of truth here, in that four of the GOP recall districts were in the top third of GOP performance in the presidential contest and governor’s race. But upon closer inspection there is an elite tier of districts that seem a much better fit for the title "deepest red." And one of the GOP-held recall seats is really closer to a toss-up district. We rate her statement Mostly False.	None	Tammy Baldwin	None	None	None	2011-08-19T09:00:00	2011-08-10	['Wisconsin', 'Democratic_Party_(United_States)']
pomt-05794	Says "sixty-two percent of small businesses over the last five years went under because they couldn't pay their health care bills."	false	/new-jersey/statements/2012/feb/24/bill-pascrell/bill-pascrell-claims-heath-care-bills-forced-62-pe/	If you’re a small business owner, the cost of providing health insurance for your employees may be worse than you thought. According to U.S. Rep. Bill Pascrell, medical bills have led about two-thirds of small businesses nationwide to close during the past five years. Pascrell (D-8th Dist.) pointed to that startling statistic during a Feb. 1 debate in the House over a bill repealing the Community Living Assistance Services and Supports Act, or the CLASS Act. That Act was a provision of the health care reform law enacted in 2010. The CLASS Act was meant to create a new insurance program for individuals to pay monthly premiums and later receive a cash benefit to support their long-term care needs. But before the program was implemented, federal officials canceled it in October 2011, pointing to legal and financial concerns. "We have to find a way to make long-term care both accessible and affordable. These problems will not simply disappear. They're not going to go away," Pascrell told his colleagues. "This bill certainly does not fix these problems. The bill does not even provide an alternative. All it does is attack the progress made in the Affordable Care Act." Pascrell added, "Sixty-two percent of small businesses over the last five years went under because they couldn't pay their health care bills, and you stand there with no alternative whatsoever." That bill passed in a 267-159 vote, with Pascrell voting against it. But PolitiFact New Jersey found it hard to believe that 62 percent of small businesses had closed during the past five years. After reaching out to Pascrell’s spokesman, we found out why: the statement’s not true. Pascrell spokesman Paul Brubaker told us the congressman meant to say that "62 percent of personal bankruptcies in 2007 were due to health care costs." "He mistakenly said ‘small businesses’ instead of ‘personal bankruptcies’ and ‘past five years’ instead of ‘five years ago,’" Brubaker added in an email. "Congressman Pascrell stands by his overall point that personal bankruptcies have been demonstrably connected to health care costs." That’s good enough for the Truth-O-Meter. But let’s explain the basis for the statistic that Pascrell was aiming for. To back up the congressman’s point, Brubaker directed us to a report published in 2009 in The American Journal of Medicine. Following a national study, researchers estimated in that report that illness or medical bills contributed to 62.1 percent of all bankruptcies in 2007 -- a significant jump from six years earlier. Many families were under-insured, leaving them responsible for large out-of-pocket costs, while others lost their private health insurance when they became too sick to work, according to the study. "Since 2001, the proportion of all bankruptcies attributable to medical problems has increased by 50%," according to the report. "Nearly two thirds of all bankruptcies are now linked to illness." As for small businesses, their numbers have declined in recent years, but that reduction is much less than 62 percent. According to the U.S. Small Business Administration’s Office of Advocacy, the number of small employers -- defined as having fewer than 500 employees -- dropped by about 4.2 percent from 6,004,056 in 2006 to 5,749,797 in 2009, which is the latest data available. We don’t know how much medical bills contributed to that reduction, but health care costs obviously remain a significant concern for small business owners. Our ruling In a speech on the House floor, Pascrell claimed that "sixty-two percent of small businesses over the last five years went under because they couldn't pay their health care bills." But his spokesman told us the congressman made a mistake and cited the wrong statistic. Pascrell meant to say health care costs led to 62 percent of personal bankruptcies five years ago.

pomt-12366	"Trump’s Top Scientist Pick: ‘Scientists Are Just Dumb Regular People That Think Dinosaurs Existed And The Earth Is Getting Warmer’"	pants on fire!	/punditfact/statements/2017/jun/06/uspoln/no-trumps-reported-pick-usda-chief-scientist-did-n/	A fake news site has taken creative license by saying that a man President Donald Trump is reportedly picking to lead a top science job actually mocked scientists, calling them "dumb regular people that think dinosaurs existed." A May 20 post by USPOLN.com headlined "Trump’s Top Scientist Pick: ‘Scientists Are Just Dumb Regular People That Think Dinosaurs Existed And The Earth Is Getting Warmer’," takes aim at Sam Clovis. News reports have said that Trump plans to nominate Clovis as undersecretary of the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Research, Education and Economics division, a position that’s been held by scientists in past administrations. Clovis is the Department of Agriculture’s senior White House adviser, but reportedly lacks a science background. He has a doctorate in public administration, has taught business, management and public policy at Morningside College in Iowa, hosted a conservative radio show and was a Trump campaign policy adviser. Has he disparaged scientists as USPOLN.com said? Facebook users flagged the post as potential fake news. We found that quotes attributed to Clovis are indeed fake. USPOLN.com calls itself a "hybrid News/Satire platform," and we’ve included it in our list of websites that deliberately post false or fake stories. A disclaimer in its "About Us" page plainly tells readers its intentions and accuracy: "USPOLN may include information from sources that may or may not be reliable and facts that don’t necessarily exist. These Articles should be considered satirical and any and all quotes attributed to actual people complete and total baloney." The USPOLN.com story about Clovis heavily borrows, almost verbatim, multiple paragraphs from a May 12 report from ProPublica, an independent, nonprofit, investigative journalism website. USPOLN.com’s opening sentences: "The research section of the USDA studies everything from nutrition to climate change, and according to the 2008 Farm Bill the ‘chief scientist’ is supposed to be the leader ‘among distinguished scientists with specialized or significant experience in agricultural research, education and economics.’ President Donald Trump’s pick, Sam Clovis, doesn’t seem to have any of those credentials. He has never taken science as part of his graduate course and questions the legitimacy of climate change. Although he has a doctorate in public administration and taught business and public policy at Morningside College for ten years, he barely published any academic work. Clovis had made a reputation for himself as a conservative talk radio show in Iowa and an avid Trump supporter." ProPublica’ first few sentences: "The USDA’s research section studies everything from climate change to nutrition. Under the 2008 Farm Bill, its leader is supposed to serve as the agency’s ‘chief scientist’ and be chosen "from among distinguished scientists with specialized or significant experience in agricultural research, education, and economics. "But Sam Clovis — who, according to sources with knowledge of the appointment and members of the agriculture trade press, is President Trump’s pick to oversee the section — appears to have no such credentials. "Clovis has never taken a graduate course in science and is openly skeptical of climate change. While he has a doctorate in public administration and was a tenured professor of business and public policy at Morningside College for 10 years, he has published almost no academic work." USPOLN.com’s post takes a satirical turn when it starts "quoting" Clovis on his comments about his credentials in an assumed interview with "KYXL Radio" (searches on the Federal Communications Commission website for a radio station with those call letters yielded zero results). The satirical website said Clovis "argued that he was ‘proud’ he didn’t have any scientific credentials or education, because ‘scientists are nothing more than a bunch of mislead (sic) individuals anyway’." The post also falsely claims Clovis said he thanks God he did not make him a scientist and that he’s proud not to be one "because they believe in things like evolution and the like." USPOLN.com links as its "source" another "hybrid News/Satire" site that has the same article posted. We asked the USDA to confirm if Clovis was Trump’s pick for the chief scientist job. The department said it could not comment in advance on any nominations for Senate-confirmed positions. What about the quotes from USPOLN.com? "Completely fabricated," the department’s communications office said, linking to a Snopes review of the story deeming the comments false. The Associated Press has also reported that the quotes are not real. Our ruling Fake news website USPOLN.com said, "Trump’s Top Scientist Pick: ‘Scientists Are Just Dumb Regular People That Think Dinosaurs Existed And The Earth Is Getting Warmer’." The website borrows some information reported by a legitimate investigative journalism website, ProPublica, such as Sam Clovis reportedly being Trump’s pick for a top USDA job and details about his resume. But the post attributes false quotes to Clovis. USPOLN.com says its articles "should be considered satirical and any and all quotes attributed to actual people complete and total baloney."

pomt-11472	President Donald "Trump’s latest set of sanctions against companies and countries benefiting North Korea includes every nation but one making shipments to (North Korea). The one nation Trump exempted from his punitive ban was . . . wait for it . . . drumroll: Russia."	mostly false	/punditfact/statements/2018/mar/06/laurence-tribe/was-russia-exempted-latest-round-north-korea-sanct/	A few days after the United States announced stepped-up sanctions against entities doing business with North Korea, Laurence Tribe, a prominent Harvard University law professor, tweeted what he saw as an anomaly -- one that benefited the country at the heart of Robert Mueller’s investigation. "Trump’s latest set of sanctions against companies and countries benefiting North Korea includes every nation but one making shipments to (North Korea). The one nation Trump exempted from his punitive ban was ... wait for it ... drumroll: Russia. How in the world did you guess?" See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com The notion that Russia might be helping North Korea evade sanctions has been widely speculated, and on March 3, the Washington Post ran a detailed story alleging that North Korea had essentially been laundering coal through Kholmsk, an obscure port in eastern Russia, for sale elsewhere. A reader asked us to take a look at Tribe’s tweet, so we did. Experts told us that Tribe has a point, but that he had garbled some aspects of his message. What the U.S. government did The sanctions are the latest round in an ongoing effort to isolate North Korea for its continued pursuit of nuclear weapons, as well as missiles to deliver them. On Feb. 23, 2018, the U.S. Treasury Department’s Office of Foreign Assets Control announced what it said were "the largest North Korea-related sanctions" to date, "aimed at disrupting North Korean shipping and trading companies and vessels." Specifically, the announced sanctions targeted "one individual, 27 entities, and 28 vessels located, registered, or flagged in North Korea, China, Singapore, Taiwan, Hong Kong, Marshall Islands, Tanzania, Panama, and Comoros. Under the sanctions, the department said, "any property or interests in property of the designated persons in the possession or control of U.S. persons or within the United States must be blocked, and U.S. persons are prohibited from dealing with any of the designated parties." The department said the sanctions were enacted "consistent with the North Korea Sanctions Policy and Enhancement Act of 2016 as well as the Countering America’s Adversaries Through Sanctions Act of 2017." See Figure 2 on PolitiFact.com Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin briefs reporters about new sanctions intended to pressure North Korea, at the White House on Feb. 23, 2018. (AP/Pablo Martinez Monsivais) Are Russian entities included in the newest sanctions? Russia was implicated, but not sanctioned directly, in the Feb. 23 announcement. The Treasury Department designated a Taiwanese citizen, Tsang Yung Yuan, for, among other things, having "coordinated North Korean coal exports with a Russia-based North Korean broker." In 2017, the department said, Tsang and Marshall Islands-based Kingly Won International Co., Ltd., "attempted to engage in an oil deal valued at over $1 million with the Russian firm Independent Petroleum Company." The sanctions announcement also cited another suspected transaction involving Russia that involved the offloading of fuel oil from an unnamed Russian vessel. For this transaction, the Korea Samma Shipping Company, a North Korean-owned firm, and its oil tanker SAM MA 2 were specifically targeted in the new round of sanctions. So Tribe has a point that despite such allegations of Russian involvement, there were no Russia-flagged vessels or Russian-owned companies specified in this round of sanctions. However, experts offered several concerns about what Tribe tweeted. • Sanctions of these sort are issued as information allows. Just because no Russian entities are on the Feb. 23 list doesn’t mean there won’t be in the future -- or that there haven’t been in the past. "The most recent sanctions list basically contains the names of firms that U.S. intelligence knows or thinks are involved in sanctions busting activities," said Stephan Haggard, director of the Korea-Pacific Program at the University of California-San Diego. As further intelligence is gathered and confirmed, that could change. Indeed, it’s important to note that the Trump administration has previously targeted Russian firms for North Korea-related sanctions, just not in this round. The Russian company cited above -- the Independent Petroleum Company -- along with one of its subsidiaries, AO NNK-Primornefteproduct, have already been sanctioned during Trump’s tenure in the White House. They were sanctioned on June 1, 2017, for suspicion of being "involved in circumventing North Korean sanctions." Trump has also publicly expressed concern about Russian actions in regard to North Korea. Shea Cotton, a research associate at the Monterey Institute of International Studies’ James Martin Center for Nonproliferation Studies, said that one of the few times he recalls Trump saying something negative about Russia was on the topic of North Korea sanctions. "Russia is not helping us at all with North Korea," Trump said during an Oval Office interview with Reuters in January 2018. "What China is helping us with, Russia is denting. In other words, Russia is making up for some of what China is doing." • Tribe’s wording was imprecise. Tribe tweeted that Trump had "exempted (Russia) from his punitive ban," but in reality, the language of the sanctions doesn't affirmatively "exempt" Russia. "The term ‘exemption’ is wrong because the designation process goes after specific individuals, entities and ships," Haggard said. "There are no ‘exemptions.’" Indeed, this round of sanctions operated entirely below the country level. Tribe also referred to countries making "shipments to" North Korea, but many of the allegations of sanctions-busting activity has involved taking North Korean products and "laundering" them for sale elsewhere. When we reached out to Tribe, he said, "I meant ‘to or from’ and was using ‘exempted from’ to mean ‘not included in’ or ‘excluded from.’" • There may not be anything nefarious about why Russian entities didn’t make this list. Joseph DeThomas, a former diplomat and a professor at Penn State’s School of International Affairs, said that he, too, noticed the absence of Russian entities from the list. But he added that it would be wrong to assume that a desire to protect Russia is the reason why. "It could be that the cases against Russian entities were not complete yet," DeThomas said. "It could be that a diplomatic process is going on behind the scenes to get the Russians to crack down on something. It could even be that there are no new Russian entities to be sanctioned. It may turn out that there is something nefarious in the absence of sanctioned Russian entities but there are enough plausible alternatives to withhold judgment." Cotton agreed. "There are plenty of benign-ish explanations which could account for this," he said. "It could be that the administration believes it can get Russia to comply with these without the need for sanctioning Russian entities. Or perhaps it believes Russia is making a good faith effort at enforcing these domestically and believes unilaterally sanctioning Russian entities would undermine Russian cooperation. It could also be that the administration has yet to obtain firm evidence regarding which Russian entities are involved and doesn’t want to do anything until they catch someone in the act." In response, Tribe called such speculation "quite empty and says nothing I’d not already considered." Our ruling Tribe said, "Trump’s latest set of sanctions against companies and countries benefiting North Korea includes every nation but one making shipments to (North Korea). The one nation Trump exempted from his punitive ban was . . . wait for it . . . drumroll: Russia." The most recent set of sanctions doesn’t specifically target any entity linked to Russia. However, sanction lists are dependent on intelligence findings, and when the U.S. government had intelligence relevant to sanctions-busting, the Trump administration has slapped sanctions on Russian entities in the past. In addition, while this sanctions list targeted violators, it didn’t proactively "exempt" any countries (something Tribe acknowledges). Finally, experts offered a variety of potential alternative explanations beyond Trump doing this to protect Russia. We rate the statement Mostly False.

pomt-04706	"The first (state) budget that came out of our Republican leadership slashed funding to Planned Parenthood...It resulted in the reduction of hours, the elimination of days, elimination of access to women in my city and all over my state."	true	/new-jersey/statements/2012/sep/04/cory-booker/cory-booker-blasts-chris-christie-slashing-funding/	Newark Mayor Cory Booker didn’t mention Gov. Chris Christie by name, but the Democratic leader took a shot at his Republican governor Tuesday for cutting funding for women’s health services. Before the mayor made a speech at the Democratic National Convention in Charlotte, N.C., Booker appeared at a Planned Parenthood rally and blasted the GOP for denying women access to health care. "Now I want to be very clear. I come from a state where we’ve seen what Republican leadership will do to things like Planned Parenthood," Booker told the crowd, according to a video posted on YouTube. "We’ve seen it. The first budget that came out of our Republican leadership slashed funding to Planned Parenthood. "It resulted in, it resulted in the reduction of hours, the elimination of days, elimination of access to women in my city and all over my state." PolitiFact New Jersey found that Booker’s claim is on target. Christie eliminated nearly $7.5 million for family planning services in his first budget for fiscal year 2011, and has rejected efforts by the Democrat-led legislature to restore that funding. As we discovered in a previous fact-check, that reduction in funding led to the closure of six family planning clinics, including two facilities run by affiliates of Planned Parenthood. Those clinics included the following: Westampton and Brown Mills locations run by the Burlington County Health Department; Planned Parenthood of Southern New Jersey’s Cherry Hill center; FamCare, Inc.’s Millville facility; the Bayonne Women’s Health and Family Planning Center; and Planned Parenthood of Greater Northern New Jersey’s Dover site. Representatives of those clinics previously told us that state funding cuts forced the closures. On three occasions, Christie has rejected efforts by the legislature to restore those family planning dollars. The first time occurred when the governor vetoed a bill passed by the legislature in June 2010 to restore the funding. At the time, Christie said New Jersey residents have access to "comprehensive reproductive health care services" at other sites and the state can’t afford to "provide duplicative funding for family planning centers." In June 2011, the legislature included the $7.5 million in the fiscal year 2012 budget sent to the governor. Christie eliminated that funding as part of his line-item vetoes, and the legislature couldn’t secure enough votes to override that veto. Most recently, the legislature passed a bill in June to restore the funding, but Christie vetoed it. Our ruling At a Planned Parenthood rally, Booker went after Christie’s record of cutting funding for family planning services. "The first budget that came out of our Republican leadership slashed funding to Planned Parenthood," Booker said. "It resulted in, it resulted in the reduction of hours, the elimination of days, elimination of access to women in my city and all over my state." It’s true that Christie eliminated nearly $7.5 million for family planning services in the fiscal year 2011 budget, and has rejected efforts to restore that funding. That funding reduction led to the closure of six family planning clinics around the state. We rate the statement True. To comment on this ruling, go to NJ.com.

pomt-09885	"14,000 Americans . . . lose their health insurance every single day."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/jul/24/barack-obama/obama-claims-14000-lose-health-insurance-every-day/	In his nationally televised news conference on July 22, 2009, President Barack Obama cited a dramatic statistic to emphasize the need for health care reform. He said, “If we don't act, 14,000 Americans will continue to lose their health insurance every single day.” The White House told us the number came from a report published by the Center for American Progress, a liberal think tank, and authored by researchers James Kvaal and Ben Furnas. A chart in the report was headlined, “14,000 People Became Uninsured Every Day in December and January.” We wondered about the methodology and whether the December and January numbers were out of date. We couldn't reach the authors of the study (one has since joined the White House staff). But we tracked down Urban Institute health care scholar John Holahan, whose work was cited in the Center for American Progress study. Holahan was the co-author, with A. Bowen Garrett, of the January 2009 study, “Rising Unemployment, Medicaid and the Uninsured,” published by the Kaiser Commission on Medicaid and the Uninsured. That study provided the underpinning for the Center for American Progress report by estimating how many people can expect to lose their insurance when the national unemployment rate goes up. Holahan and his co-author, using a baseline of 4.6 percent unemployment in 2007, calculated that 2.6 million people would lose coverage if the unemployment rate climbed to 7 percent; 3.7 million if it went to to 8 percent; 4.8 million at 9 percent; and 5.8 million at 10 percent. The estimates took into account people who lost their jobs but then switched to a spouse’s plan or extended their coverage through COBRA, the federal law that guarantees people who lose their job can still get continued health coverage. Applying Holahan's calculations to the actual rise in unemployment from November 2008 to June 2009, we came up with 3.2 million people losing health coverage, or an average of 15,238 per day, so it is close to the 14,000 Obama cited. We asked other health care experts about Holahan’s work, and they uniformly agreed that he is a respected researcher. Only one complicating factor emerged, when we spoke with Edmund F. Haislmaier of the Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank. He noted that Holahan’s paper was written before passage of the federal stimulus package, which contains provisions subsidizing 65 percent of COBRA costs for the unemployed. If these new subsidies end up boosting the use of COBRA — the data hasn't been compiled yet — then it could reduce the number of newly uninsured Americans from the levels that Holahan had predicted and that Obama cited. Obama was very close to Holohan's calculations — in fact he was slightly low. But as Haislmaier pointed out, the stimulus COBRA provisions could reduce the numbers because more people will still be covered. We can't be sure until the data is in. So in the meantime, we find Obama’s claim Mostly True.	None	Barack Obama	None	None	None	2009-07-24T14:33:52	2009-07-22	['United_States']
pomt-07733	Under a proposed Georgia law, "women who miscarry could become felons."	mostly true	/georgia/statements/2011/mar/02/liberal-blogger/liberal-blogger-says-abotion-bill-could-affect-mis/	Republican state Rep. Bobby Franklin has made a hobby out of triggering liberal ire. And yes, he’s done it again. The Marietta legislator’s House Bill 1 rejects the authority of landmark U.S. Supreme Court ruling Roe v. Wade. It bans abortion and labels it "prenatal murder," a crime punishable by life in prison or death. But that’s not what had bloggers at left-leaning publications seething. It’s that they think the bill could allow prosecutors to charge mothers who miscarry with a crime. Jen Phillips, a staffer with liberal magazine Mother Jones, wrote the bill "showed an astonishing lack of concern for women’s health and well-being." "Under Rep. Franklin’s bill, HB 1, women who miscarry could become felons if they cannot prove that there was ‘no human involvement whatsoever in the causation’ of their miscarriage," she wrote. Women who miscarry could be charged as felons? Is that true? Franklin has sponsored similar anti-abortion bills without success. This one doesn’t have much steam behind it, either. But given how this claim took off in the blogosphere, we thought it was worth a look. We called Phillips, who pointed us to a portion of the bill that defines "prenatal murder." "Such a term does not include a naturally occurring expulsion of a fetus known medically as a ‘spontaneous abortion’ and popularly as a ‘miscarriage’ so long as there is no human involvement whatsoever in the causation of such event," the bill states. The problem is the phrase "no human involvement" is so broad and the causes of miscarriage can be so complex and difficult to understand that any woman whose actions can be viewed as playing a role in her miscarriage could be prosecuted, Phillips argued. This could be a problem. Other critics we interviewed said that under this language, a woman who miscarried could be prosecuted for choosing cancer treatment, taking illegal drugs, or falling off a bicycle while pregnant. All of those situations require some "human involvement." Franklin said these objections have absolutely no merit. "[T]hose criticisms are mere smoke screens since as you know the bill does not specifically call for … those things," Franklin wrote in an e-mail. Abortion rights advocates agreed that Franklin’s legislation could criminalize miscarriage. A spokeswoman for anti-abortion group Georgia Right to Life said they have not analyzed the bill. Franklin is right that the bill does not specify that women can be prosecuted under the scenarios that critics raised. However, laws can have unexpected consequences. We therefore took a closer look at Georgia law. An existing state statute on "feticide," or the destruction of a fetus in the uterus, generally bars women from being prosecuted in the death of her fetus. Frankin’s bill does not repeal this law. But there’s an exception under Georgia’s "feticide by vehicle" statute. In a 2010 Douglasville case, a pregnant driver fled from police, leading them on a chase. The driver crashed. Her baby was delivered by emergency C-section but did not survive. Prosecutors charged the pregnant driver. While Georgia’s "feticide by vehicle" statute does not mandate mothers be charged when they cause crashes leading to the death of their own fetuses, it does not prohibit it. Research shows that nationally, women have been prosecuted for conduct affecting their fetuses, even when the law does not expressly provide for it, said Lynn Paltrow, executive director of National Advocates for Pregnant Women, which fights anti-abortion laws. Paltrow gave us examples, which we confirmed. For instance, in a 2008 South Carolina case, a woman faced homicide charges after attempting suicide while eight months pregnant, killing the fetus. A 1997 state Supreme Court ruling decided that a fetus is considered a child if it is viable, or able to live outside the uterus. This means pregnant women can be prosecuted under state child abuse statutes. In Missouri, the law bars prosecuting a woman for "indirectly harming her unborn child by failing to properly care for herself or by failing to follow any particular program of prenatal care," but mothers have been charged with child abuse and convicted of involuntary manslaughter for substance abuse while pregnant, news accounts show. Since HB 1 does not repeal existing Georgia feticide law, it’s possible to argue its passage might not lead to the prosecution of women in the death of their fetuses. A judge might decide the earlier feticide law prevents it. However, such a ruling is no sure thing. In conclusion: Critics of Franklin’s bill say that the "human involvement" language is so vague that women could be prosecuted for miscarriages, and we agree with them. While the law does not explicitly allow for miscarriage prosecutions, and Franklin said this is not his intent, the language is so broad it does open the door for women to face felony charges if they abuse drugs, fall off a bicycle, fail to wear a seat belt, or opt for cancer treatment while pregnant. Women in Georgia and across the nation have previously been prosecuted for actions investigators think adversely affected their fetuses, even if the law does not specifically call for them to do so. However, women who miscarry might not be handled as felons. It depends on how prosecutors and judges decide to handle the law. The statement could use a little more context. We therefore rule Phillips’ statement Mostly True.	None	Liberal Blogger	None	None	None	2011-03-02T06:00:00	2011-02-23	['None']
pomt-02939	"The number of Americans who receive means-tested government benefits -- welfare -- now outnumbers those who are year-round full-time workers."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2013/oct/30/charlie-sykes/charlie-sykes-says-today-there-are-more-people-wel/	Welfare reform might have passed in 1996 but the idea of welfare remains one of the raw nerves in American politics. Conservative radio talk show host Charlie Sykes tapped into that theme during his regular morning show on WTMJ in Milwaukee. He teed it up by explaining why the American taxpayer was the "loser of the day." "According to the new census data, the number of Americans who receive means-tested government benefits -- welfare -- now outnumbers those who are year-round full-time workers," Sykes said. "Wow. We’ve been struggling, but in terms of the tipping point here, where you have more people who are on these benefit programs, these are the means-tested benefit programs, than the people who are actually working and paying the taxes." In this fact-check, we’ll look into whether today there are more people getting these benefits than there are full-time workers. By the way, means-tested applies to aid that comes only if the person is poor enough to qualify. The programs include Medicaid, the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (food stamps), subsidized housing and several others which we’ll mention below. We asked Sykes where he got his information and he sent us a link to an article that appeared on the CNS News website. CNS News is a project of the Media Research Center, a conservative group that aims to counter what it sees as liberal bias in the media. The CNS News item accurately cited two reports from the Census Bureau. One report gave the number of 108 million people receiving at least one means-tested benefit. The other gave the number of 101 million people who work full time. The math seems simple, but those reports don’t tell the entire story. Here’s why. Census Bureau includes double counting The original CNS article links to the key Census Bureau tables. The table on recipients of means-tested aid has this note at the top. "The figures for means-tested programs include anyone residing in a household in which one or more people received benefits from the program." So, if one person receives Supplemental Security Income, a program for disabled adults, the entire household was included in the tally. As a result, it was possible for full-time workers to be counted as recipients. Another table in the same data collection gives an idea of how common that might be. Out of a total of more than 108 million recipients, there were more than 79 million households with at least one person working. The data don’t say whether that was a full-time worker but the numbers guarantee that the tally of recipients is exaggerated. Time frame Sykes said this was a situation that exists "now," but what is interesting is the article is very clear that this information is from 2011. Here’s the article’s first line: "Americans who were recipients of means-tested government benefits in 2011 outnumbered year-round full-time workers, according to data released this month by the Census Bureau," it said. Sykes spoke about a situation that he said existed today. The economy in 2011 is not the one we have in 2013. Among other big differences, unemployment is lower by 1.4 percentage points. Updating the numbers We went to several agency websites to determine what their participation figures look like today. In every case that we could check, they had declined. Subsidized housing: The 2011 survey had 13 million. For 2012, we found 9 million. SNAP (food stamps): The 2011 survey had 49 million. For 2013, we found 47 million. Medicaid: The 2011 survey had 82 million. For 2013, we found 72 million. TANF (welfare): The 2011 survey had 5.8 million. For 2013, we found 3.7 million. In contrast, the number of full-time workers went up. The article cited 101 million. In 2013, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported 142 million. We are unable to duplicate the Census Bureau method for 2013. It was based on a survey and used statistical techniques to generate its figures. So today there are generally less people receiving some type of government assistance and more people working full time. One final note: The number of recipients includes millions of children under the age of 16 and the elderly. The Census Bureau tally folds in the school lunch program. In the spring of this year, 29 million students benefited from that. About a third of the residents of public housing are over 62. By most standards, we don’t expect these people to work. To compare them to the number of full-time workers might be useful policy information but to fail to note that children and the elderly, not to mention the blind and disabled, are folded into the tally of recipients is highly misleading. Our ruling Sykes said that "the number of Americans who receive means-tested government benefits -- welfare -- now outnumbers those who are year-round full-time workers." Sykes ignored that the article he read, in its first line, described the situation in 2011, not today. In addition, current numbers look quite different from 2011 when the country was at a lower point in its slow climb back from a deep recession. The article also pointed to the original data tables where it was clear that at the very least, the numbers could have blurred the distinction between those who work and those who are counted as recipients. The failure to note the large numbers of children and elderly in the recipient group is also a significant lapse in the context of comparing them to the number of full-time workers. We rate the claim False. Correction: An earlier version of this fact-check wrongly identified the Media Research Center.

pomt-11778	"Melania Trump: 'If ISIS Lays a finger on Barron, I’ll scratch Obama’s eyes out.' "	pants on fire!	/punditfact/statements/2017/nov/28/yournewswirecom/no-proof-melania-trump-said-if-isis-harms-her-son-/	No, the first lady did not really issue a threat to former President Barack Obama over the safety of her son. A headline on Yournewswire.com fabricated the quote in a clickbait headline: "Melania Trump: ‘If ISIS Lays a finger on Barron, I’ll scratch Obama’s eyes out." Facebook users flagged the Nov. 23 post as being potentially fabricated, as part of the social network’s efforts to combat fake news. Yournewswire.com is a fake news website. In this case, the article is not entirely fictional because it was based on a threat by an ISIS supporter. However, there is no evidence that Trump responded with her own threat against former President Barack Obama. Yournewswire.com cites an article in the Washington Free Beacon, which stated that pro-ISIS internet channels called for the assassination of the son of Melania and President Donald Trump. The Free Beacon attributed the information to the Middle East Media Research Institute, an organization that tracks jihadist propaganda. The institute found the information about the threat against Barron on Telegram, a social media network. Here’s what the group reported: On November 21, 2017, a supporter of the Islamic State (ISIS) on Telegram called for the assassination of Barron Trump, and shared the name of the school that Barron attends along with a Google map pinpointing its location. Using the hashtag "handle the son of the mule of America," the supporter, who uses the name "Dak Al-Munafiqeen," Arabic for "striking the hypocrites," wrote: "Barron Trump goes to this school in Washington." The post was followed by a photo of Barron Trump. To widely disseminate the call for assassination, several pro-ISIS Telegram channels have shared and forwarded the post. The report drew scant mainstream media attention. While Telegram is used by a lot of people worldwide, it is particularly popular with jihadis and ISIS supporters, said Steven Stalinsky, MEMRI executive director. "It's the main vehicle for ISIS and their supporters to use to communicate and put out propaganda," he said. The threat against Barron on Telegram from a supporter is not the equivalent of an official communique by ISIS, Daveed Gartenstein-Ross, a terrorism expert at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, told PolitiFact. "The fact that someone on an ISIS channel said it online doesn’t make it a significant threat," he said. "Anything said by some extremist on Telegram is not exactly breaking news that most outlets pick up in any way." Where the YourNewsWire.com story really goes into fake territory is the idea that Melania Trump responded to the threat by saying "if ISIS Lays a finger on Barron, I’ll scratch Obama’s eyes out." We could not find any evidence that she responded at all. We contacted YourNewsWire.com and received a reply from the editor in chief, Sean Adl-Tabatabai, who said PolitiFact is "policing the internet as part of a a faux moral crusade on behalf of the Clinton regime." Our ruling YourNewsWire.com stated that Melania Trump said, "If ISIS Lays a finger on Barron, I’ll scratch Obama’s eyes out." We found no evidence that Melania Trump responded to an online threat against Barron at all — much less that she said she would enact revenge on Obama. We rate this headline Pants on Fire.

pomt-06878	"Polls now show a majority of Catholics favor marriage equality."	mostly true	/new-jersey/statements/2011/jul/31/steven-goldstein/garden-state-equality-chairman-steven-goldstein-sa/	Last weekend was "bittersweet" for Steven Goldstein. Same-sex couples could wed legally in New York, while Goldstein, the head of the gay rights advocacy group Garden State Equality, said New Jersey is "still denied that freedom." Goldstein, whose group filed a lawsuit this summer aiming to legalize same-sex marriage in New Jersey, argued in a July 24 column published in The Sunday Star-Ledger’s Perspective section that New Jersey’s civil union law doesn’t provide real equality. "The governor cites his faith as a basis for his opposition to marriage equality," wrote Goldstein. "But no faith is monolithic on any issue. Polls now show a majority of Catholics favor marriage equality, as does the general electorate." Do a majority of Catholics really favor gay marriage? Goldstein provided PolitiFact New Jersey with two national surveys to support his statement, and they mostly do. First, let’s note that both polls -- and another survey we found -- highlighted the views of white Catholics. Pollsters said this is done to control for race and because white Catholics are considered a swing voter group. But we’re going to look at all Catholics since Goldstein didn’t distinguish. Also, because the Catholics made up a smaller group than the poll sample, the margins of error are higher. An ABC News/Washington Post poll released in March asked 1,005 adults, "do you think it should be legal or illegal for gay and lesbian couples to get married?" It found that among those who identified themselves as Catholic, 60 percent support same-sex marriage and 38 percent oppose it, with a 7.5 percentage point margin of error. A Public Religion Research Institute poll released in May surveyed 1,007 adults. It asked respondents whether they strongly favor, favor, oppose or strongly oppose "allowing gay and lesbian couples to legally marry." It found among the Catholics surveyed, 56 percent either favored or strongly favored and 36 percent either opposed or strongly opposed, with a margin of error of 7 percentage points. It’s worth noting that in another national poll by the Public Religion Research Institute from September 2010, when Catholics were given the option of choosing civil unions, support for marriage dipped. It found that of the Catholics surveyed, 43 percent said gay couples should be allowed to marry, 31 percent said gay couples should be allowed to form civil unions but not marry and 22 percent said there should be no legal recognition of a gay couple’s relationship. It’s also worth noting that in that poll, the more often Catholics said they went to church, the less likely they were to support same-sex marriage. A national Quinnipiac University poll released in July that asked 2,311 registered voters whether they "would support or oppose a law in your state that would same-sex couples to get married?" Of the Catholics surveyed, 53 percent said they would support such a law in their state and 41 percent said they would oppose, with a margin of error of 4.9 percentage points. Mark Gray, a research associate with the Center for Applied Research in the Apostolate, pointed to his analysis of 2010 data from the General Social Survey, which found that 48 percent of Catholics either strongly agreed or agreed that "homosexual couples should have the right to marry one another" and 36 percent disagreed or strongly disagreed, with a 5.8 percentage point margin of error. "Right now at this point you can’t really say it’s a majority, you can’t really say it’s not a majority, given the margin of error," Gray said. Michele Dillon, chair of University of New Hampshire’s department of sociology, said "the actual percentage varies poll to poll, it’s either close or over 50 percent," but, "the momentum is in favor of same-sex marriage" -- both nationally and among Catholics. Bill Donohue, president of the Catholic League, said "there’s no question there’s been a movement" in favor of same-sex marriage, mostly driven by a younger generation. Young people, "including young Catholics, are far more likely to be supportive of gay marriage," he said. But, Donohue argued, "people tend to be a bit more liberal" when asked their opinion on the phone, "as opposed to the privacy of the ballot box." Back to Goldstein’s statement. Goldstein said, "polls now show a majority of Catholics favor marriage equality." We found polls generally support his claim. However, because the margins of error are so high -- enough to possibly affect the results -- we rate Goldstein’s statement Mostly True. To comment on this ruling, go to NJ.com.

pomt-04437	"There's not one Democrat who endorses" the Romney-Ryan Medicare plan.	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/oct/12/joe-biden/joe-biden-says-no-democrats-support-paul-ryans-med/	In their only face-to-face debate of the campaign, Vice President Joe Biden and U.S. Rep. Paul Ryan of Wisconsin challenged and chided each other’s proposals, particularly on the hot-button issue of Medicare reform. Ryan is the author of a House budget proposal that calls for substantial changes to the government health care program for seniors, including an eventual shift to "premium support" which beneficiaries could use to purchase private insurance. Romney has embraced it as a means of introducing choice and competition into Medicare. Democrats, including Biden and President Barack Obama, say it will end up costing seniors more. In the Oct. 11 debate, Ryan defended the plan as having bipartisan support: "This is a plan that's bipartisan. It's a plan I put together with a prominent Democrat senator from Oregon," said Ryan. "There's not one Democrat who endorses it," Biden interjected. "Our partner is a Democrat from Oregon," Ryan answered amid some cross-talk. "And he said he does no longer support (it)," Biden insisted. Medicare -- complex, polarizing and highly political because of the huge voting bloc of seniors who cherish it -- is center stage in the campaign. We decided to check who’s right about across-aisle-support for the Republican plan. The Ryan budgets Ryan, the Republican House budget chairman, first unveiled a budget blueprint in early 2011 that would convert Medicare to the premium support model. It also raised the program’s eligibility age from 65 to 67, called for a repeal of Obamacare and reined in other spending to reduce the federal deficit. It passed the House on April 15, 2011, but the Democrat-controlled Senate rejected it a month later. Arguments over Medicare hit a fever pitch that year, with Democrats accusing Republicans of voting to "end Medicare." Then, in December, the hope of compromise peeked through the partisan clouds. Ryan and Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., joined together and offered a compromise on Medicare reform ideas. Their ideas were contained in a white paper -- never taking the form of legislation -- and were branded as marrying the best proposals from each side. The main difference from Ryan’s original plan: The new proposal left in place traditional Medicare for those who wanted it, while still offering premium support to buy private policies. "There's a lot to work with here in terms of trying to find common ground," Wyden said at the time, according to the Washington Post. "This doesn't end Medicare as we know it. People can go to bed knowing that traditional Medicare will be there for them for all time." He said the plan presented "the opportunity for progressives and conservatives to come together and address the real challenges" of the federal entitlement program: rising health costs and an aging population. Democrats were unequivocal in their criticism. The White House returned to the old party line, saying the plan would "end Medicare as we know it." House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi and other House Democrats said it would essentially kill Medicare. Republicans, who sensed a political opportunity in the defection of Wyden, offered more open-minded reactions. Newt Gingrich, who called Ryan's original plan "right-wing social engineering," praised the Ryan-Wyden deal as "a major breakthrough." Wyden, a senator since 1996, is known as policy-driven and liberal-minded, but also a true and rare compromiser. He told the Oregonian newspaper in March 2012 that he was not being punished by Democratic leaders for partnering with Ryan, saying his biggest adversaries were special interests. "When you deal with a big issue where there are a lot of passions, you expect this," he said then. "I made the judgment that I couldn't just sit by and talk about business as usual for this program that, for me, has been sacred for three decades." He also found himself fending off suggestions by Romney that he abetted the Republicans’ Medicare plan. Wyden, according to the Oregonian, said he'd never spoken to Romney. He posted an explanation in the Huffington Post titled "Preserving the Medicare Guarantee: Why I've Been Working with Paul Ryan." He used personal anecdotes to explain his motivation to fight for seniors and warned that serious reform was needed to preserve the "guarantee to all Americans that they will have high quality health care as they get older." In the meantime, Ryan unveiled his budget proposal for 2013. It contained many of the same hallmarks as its predecessor: reduced federal spending, repeal of Obamacare. Only this one incorporated the Ryan-Wyden plan for Medicare, with premium support and the traditional option. Wyden said he was wary of the wider proposal, citing a lower limit for Medicare's spending growth and a full repeal of the health care overhaul. He also warned his Medicare white paper should not be used to anoint the whole Ryan budget as having bipartisan support. "Any person on the right who says that this is about cover -- that person is hurting senior citizens," Wyden said in a March 20 story in Congressional Quarterly Today. "I say that explicitly because they're making it tougher to get a bipartisan agreement in the future." Partners no more If the spring of 2012 showed the Ryan-Wyden romance fading, late summer was the break-up. On Aug. 11, 2012, Ryan was tapped as Romney’s running mate, and within days, Romney was hailing his VP nominee’s Medicare plan as bipartisan -- and naming Wyden. "Paul Ryan and Sen. Wyden said, 'No, we need to restore, retain and protect Medicare,' " Romney said at a campaign stop in Virginia. "That's what our party will do." The Post wrote that Wyden was "apparently displeased about his sudden prominence as a validator of the Republican ticket." "Gov. Romney is talking nonsense," Wyden told reporters, according to the Post. He explained in detail his two main objections to Romney’s proposals in an interview with Ezra Klein, who writes the Post’s Wonk Blog. Repealing Obamacare, he said, would undo changes to Medicare that are necessary to transition to premium support. Secondly, Romney has proposed turning Medicaid, the health care program for the poor and disabled, into a block grant to the states and rein in spending. That change, Wyden said, "would do enormous harm to those people whose protection was at the center of the white paper." Romney’s approach to Medicaid "completely pulls the rug out from under the poorest and most vulnerable seniors," he said. If any doubt remained following the vice presidential debate on Oct. 11 about Wyden’s position on the Republican Medicare plan, Wyden addressed it the same night on his Facebook page. "The Republican ticket knows that neither I, nor any other Democrat, would support these policies. The Romney/Ryan plan on Medicare is further proof that Mitt Romney is singularly unfit to end gridlock and bring bipartisan solutions to Washington," he wrote. Our ruling Biden said "there’s not one Democrat who endorses" the Republican proposal to fundamentally restructure Medicare. That hasn’t always been the case. Last year, Wyden and Ryan put their heads together and offered a compromise proposal for the future of Medicare. But that bipartisan bond began to crack months ago when the Wisconsin congressman put forth a second budget with provisions Wyden opposed. Their partnership dissolved in August, after Ryan joined the Romney ticket, and Wyden made a point of talking up the differences between his and the Republicans’ ideas for Medicare, not the similarities. Wyden was the only Democrat to endorse Ryan’s idea of premium support in Medicare, and his approval has clearly been revoked. We rate Biden’s statement True.

pomt-13815	"Granite State shipbuilders . . . built the first ship that sailed into battle under a new American flag."	half-true	/new-hampshire/statements/2016/jul/15/frank-guinta/frank-guinta-says-first-ship-fly-american-flag-bat/	Along with hamburgers and hot dogs, the residents of the Live Free or Die state were served up an interesting tidbit about New Hampshire’s history this Fourth of July by Congressman Frank Guinta. In a patriotic holiday email, the 1st Congressional District Republican emphasized New Hampshire’s role in the Revolutionary War. "The colonies, with a lot of help from Granite State shipbuilders, who built the first ship that sailed into battle under a new American flag, won the Revolutionary War, created what is now the world's oldest constitutional democracy, and charted a course to freedom and prosperity," he wrote. There’s a lot to be proud of in there. But we were intrigued by the piece that we’d never heard before: New Hampshire shipbuilders made the ship that debuted a new American flag in battle. To show our American spirit, PolitiFact N.H. turned to the history books to get to the bottom of this claim. Detailing the claim Guinta’s communications director, Brendan Thomas, said it was the USS Raleigh – built at the site of the current-day Portsmouth Naval Shipyard – that first sailed into battle flying a new variant of the American flag. Thomas noted that the state celebrates this information in its online history of the state seal, which features the Raleigh. Without further explanation, NH.gov says that the Raleigh was "the first to carry the American flag into sea battle." The ship launched in 1776, at a time when the country had no official flag, and sailed until 1778, after Congress defined the first variant of today’s Stars and Stripes. Thomas couldn’t say exactly which variant it was that the Raleigh premiered, except that it was "not necessarily the Stars and Stripes" and "may have been a Union Jack surrounded by stars and stripes." That design – a Union Jack in the upper left with the rest filled out by alternating red and white stripes – is considered to be the first American flag, although unofficially, according to Marc Leepson’s 2006 book, Flag: An American Biography. It went by many names, including the Continental Colors and the Grand Union Flag. The Continental Colors The Raleigh wasn’t the first to fly the Continental Colors, according to national historical records. That flag was first flown Dec. 3, 1775, on the USS Alfred by Navy Lieutenant John Paul Jones, according to a history by the Federal Citizen Information Center. Guinta was talking about the first ship that sailed into battle under a new flag, however, not just the flag being hoisted in the harbor, so Jones’s story doesn’t fit the bill. Still, an armada led by Commodore Esek Hopkins – including the Alfred, Columbus, Cabot and Andrew Doria – marked the first overseas victory for an American flag-flying ship, again before the Raleigh launched, according to Leepson’s book. That armada set sail Jan. 4, 1776, flying the Continental Colors, and captured forts Montagu and Nassau on the eastern end of New Providence in the British-owned Bahamas on March 17, 1776. The Raleigh first launched two months later on May 21, 1776, according to the U.S. Navy. So before the Raleigh ever took to the sea, the Continental Colors were already successful in a naval battle. The Stars and Stripes If the Raleigh didn’t premier the Continental Colors, it could have been the first to go into battle flying an early version of the Stars and Stripes. The Continental Colors, according to Leepson’s book, remained the colonies’ unofficial flag until June 14, 1777. That’s when the Second Continental Congress passed the Flag Act of 1777, setting the stage for the first variant of the Stars and Stripes. According to Leepson’s book, the first ship flying the Stars and Stripes that was victorious over a foreign force was the USS Providence on Jan. 27, 1778. It captured the British Fort Nassau, seized ammunition and freed more than two dozen American prisoners. There’s a small window for Guinta’s claim to be true, if the Raleigh had sailed into battle – one that didn’t merit Leepson’s distinction of the first victory – between June of 1777 and the following January. The Raleigh’s history The Raleigh did sail across the Atlantic Ocean alongside the Alfred during that time, getting into a few scuffles with British ships along the way, according to the Naval History and Heritage Command. But there’s no record of what flags the ships were flying. The only mention of the Raleigh’s flag was on a subsequent voyage that ended in the ship’s capture on Sept. 27, 1778. A midshipman on the Raleigh "struck the Continental colors" to end a battle in Maine’s Penobscot Bay, meaning he lowered the ship’s flag in an indication of surrender, according to the U.S. Navy’s history. Notably, it was the Continental Colors – not the Stars and Stripes – that the Raleigh was flying before it was taken and adopted into the British fleet. And that’s after the USS Providence’s victory in the Bahamas in January. Historians’ take PolitiFact N.H. asked U.S. Navy Commander Chris Rentfrow, a professor at the U.S. Naval Academy, for his take on the claim. He wrote in an email that he’s not aware of any evidence supporting the USS Raleigh being the first to fly the American flag. He said the honor of first flying the Continental Colors goes to the Alfred. "Raleigh certainly would have flown this flag (the Continental Colors), as she was a contemporary of Hopkins' Alfred," Rentfrow wrote. "The ‘Stars and Stripes,’ as you probably know, came about in 1777. Did Raleigh fly it? Probably. She was in service until captured by the British in 1778. I'm not aware that she was ‘first’ to fly it. We teach our students that the first foreign acknowledgement of the Stars and Stripes was when John Paul Jones' ship Ranger was saluted by the French in 1778." Portsmouth shipbuilders were responsible for many prominent early vessels – including the Ranger and the Raleigh – "thanks in large part to the lobbying and persistence of John Langdon," a famed New Hampshire governor and founder, said state archivist Brian Burford. He referenced the writing of New Hampshire maritime historian Richard Winslow, who wrote in 1988 a history of Portsmouth shipbuilding between 1775 and 1815, but was unable to confirm the claim Guinta made. The French salute of the Stars and Stripes aboard the Ranger, however, may be something of a consolation prize for Granite Staters, because it, too, was built in Portsmouth. Neither Burford, the state archivist, nor Malia Ebel, a reference librarian and archivist for the New Hampshire Historical Society, could give a certain answer about Guinta’s claim. Ebel said it’s possible that the Raleigh flew an early variant of the Stars and Stripes, but "there’s sort of a dearth of information about this particular flag at this point." "He’s not necessarily wrong. We just can’t confirm what he said," Ebel said. The strongest evidence in support of the claim comes from the entry on the state’s website about the state seal, which offers only a vague, passing reference: "The Raleigh has a checkered career of adversities, while becoming the first to carry the American flag into sea battle." The website cites as its source a 1981 history written by Leon Anderson, a deceased former Monitor reporter and columnist who became a state legislative historian. Ebel said no more detailed information could be found in the manual that Anderson wrote. "Even more unfortunately," she said, "it doesn’t have a citation, so we don’t know where it came from." Our ruling Guinta said "Granite State shipbuilders . . . built the first ship that sailed into battle under a new American flag." Although the USS Raleigh sailed fewer than two years before it was captured, its service spanned two versions of the American flag. The Raleigh definitely flew an earlier variant of the American Flag, called the Continental Colors, but it wasn’t the first to do so. Experts said it likely flew the other variant, an early version of the Stars and Stripes, but there’s no evidence that it was the first to do so in battle. The gist of Guinta’s claim is true: New Hampshire shipbuilders were critical to the success of the fledgling American Navy. He could have easily pointed to the story of the Portsmouth-built Ranger carrying the first American flag that was ever saluted by a foreign nation. But there’s scant evidence to support the idea that the Raleigh was the first to sail into battle flying any variant of the American flag. On balance, we rate the claim Half True.

pomt-09383	The federal health care plan "costs Texas taxpayers $2.4 billion per year."	mostly false	/texas/statements/2010/mar/26/david-dewhurst/dewhurst-says-states-health-care-tab-24-billion-ye/	The hot debate over health care policy boiled in the days after Congress acted to revamp the nation’s health care system. In Texas, Lt. Gov. David Dewhurst, a Republican, lashed out at the new law, saying in a Sunday statement: "This federal plan costs Texas taxpayers $2.4 billion per year." That's a big tab; the entire general revenue fund budget for state health and human services is about $12 billion this year. Was Dewhurst on the money? First, let's stipulate that the plan signed into law this week by President Barack Obama will cost states and the federal government. There is a cost to extending health coverage to as many as 32 million uninsured Americans — and with 6.1 million people lacking health insurance, Texas has the nation's largest share (25.1 percent) of uninsured residents. Among the changes wrought by health care reform: requiring most Americans to have coverage and expanding Medicaid, the government-run health insurance program for the poor financed with federal and state dollars. Both are expected to affect state budgets. Starting in 2014, the law makes it easier to qualify for Medicaid; everyone who makes up to 133 percent of the federal poverty level will be eligible. (For a family of four, that level is currently $29,327. For a single person, it's $14,404.) The Texas Health and Human Services Commission assumes that about 2 million people will sign up for the Medicaid and Children's Health Insurance Program because of the new federal law. The cost will be largely covered by an influx of federal aid, possibly amounting to more than $120 billion. That'll be a dramatic shift for Texas, which limits access to Medicaid more than most states. Currently, adult Texans without children do not qualify, and the vast majority of the people in Medicaid are children. Few poor parents are covered unless they're disabled or pregnant. Mike Wintemute, a Dewhurst spokesman, said the lieutenant governor was referring to a state Health and Human Services Commission analysis that estimates the health care law will cost Texas $24.3 billion over 10 years. To reach the annual figure, Dewhurst divided by 10. Dewhurst, Gov. Rick Perry and Texas House Speaker Joe Straus cited the 10-year figure in a March 19 letter to members of the Texas congressional delegation urging them to vote against the Democratic-backed health care legislation. Similarly, U.S. Rep. John Carter, R-Round Rock, posted a Facebook message Thursday saying the law would "cost Texans $24.3 billion in Medicaid spending over the next 10 years." Carter erred; the state estimate doesn't cover the next 10 years. Instead, Texas based its cost estimates on the decade that begins nearly four years from now, in 2014 — the year Medicaid costs will start surging. That's not the time frame (2010-19) the federal government is using to project costs. Using different decades makes it hard to compare Texas' cost projections with others. The figure cited by Dewhurst and others is also problematic for other reasons. First, Dewhurt's total is based on the maximum sum — $24.3 billion — that can be drawn from the commission's analysis. The agency's report, issued earlier this year, specifies $15.6 billion as the baseline cost of the legislation's 10-year impact. Another $6 billion related to losses in federal aid for hospitals is listed as "possible." The remainder (less than $3 billion) relates to provisions that were not yet part of the plan. Second, the state’s cost estimate is based on an earlier version of the legislation, not the final bill. Various "fixes" to the law — known as the reconciliation measure — passed Congress this week and will also be reflected in future updates of the cost estimate. During the first few years, the federal government will shoulder 100 percent of the burden for Medicaid expansion and then scale back to about 90 percent. But much of the estimated cost of health reform to Texas is not due to Medicaid expansion per se — that is, serving people who do not yet qualify for the program — but from taking care of those who are eligible now but not signed up. The state calculates that, primarily because of the the new law's requirement that people get coverage, more than 550,000 already-eligible folks will be among the 2 million to enroll in Medicaid and CHIP in future years. When they start showing up, in what's called the "welcome mat" phenomenon, they will cost the state more than the newly qualified enrollees because the federal government will pay less of the cost to serve them. The state’s estimate puts these "welcome mat" costs at $11.4 billion — nearly half of the $24.3 billion total. The Austin-based Center for Public Policy Priorities, an advocate for low- and middle-income Texans, has criticized the state for putting those costs in their estimate. A spokeswoman for the health commission, Stephanie Goodman, defended their inclusion, saying that no matter the reason they enter the government programs, those new enrollees will be costly. Anne Dunkelberg, the center's associate director, also questioned the "possible" $6 billion that the analysis says could be needed to replace hospital funding that might be lost because of the new law. That money goes to hospitals that treat large numbers of Medicaid patients and the uninsured. As the number of uninsured patients drops, those subsidies are expected to fall too. Dunkelberg said that cost is overstated because the federal cuts will be targeted to states that have fewer uninsured people. In fact, said Goodman, state analysts will likely reduce that $6 billion estimate, though by how much is not known. A March 20 letter from U.S. Rep. Henry Waxman, D-California, chairman of the House Committee on Energy and Commerce, to U.S. Rep. Henry Cuellar, D-Laredo, refers to a Congressional Budget Office estimate that Waxman says would put the Texas share of the Medicaid expansion, including the costs of increased enrollment by people already eligible, "in the neighborhood of" $1.4 billion from 2014 through 2019. Of course, that number covers only the first five years of the Medicaid expansion. But it seems unlikely that a full 10-year analysis would ramp up the total cost as high as the state's $24.3 billion figure. So, where does that leave Dewhurst's claim that the federal plan will cost Texas taxpayers $2.4 billion per year? Basically, on squishy ground. Here's why: (1) $6 billion of the estimate was labeled by the state as a "possible" cost, and the agency has since indicated that figure is high. (2) The state estimate covers a 10-year period that does not start until 2014 and is based on an outdated version of health care legislation. (3) Nearly half of the $24.3 billion cited by Dewhurst is money the state would have to spend anyway — regardless of health care reform — if people already eligible for Medicaid and CHIP signed up now. But it's an expense that would probably not come due without the new law. We rate Dewhurst's statement as Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.	None	David Dewhurst	None	None	None	2010-03-26T22:11:37	2010-03-21	['Texas']
pomt-12261	Giving a committee chair’s stipend in the New York State Senate to another member of that committee "has been, in fact, a legislative practice for decades."	false	/new-york/statements/2017/jul/10/diane-savino/stipends-vice-chairs-state-senate-new-practice-not/	A recent uproar in Albany centered on how eight New York state senators, since 2015, have been paid stipends worth thousands of dollars for committee chairmanships they do not hold. Diane Savino, a Democrat from Staten Island, called the practice business as usual in the Senate. "In Albany there seems to be an obsession with something that has been, in fact, a legislative practice for decades," Savino said in an interview on NY1, Charter's 24-hour news channel in New York City. Is Savino right that this has been going on for decades? How senators are paid Each Senate leadership position includes a stipend on top of a senator’s $79,500 salary. Stipends range from $9,000 for lower leadership posts to the $41,500 stipend collected by Senate Majority Leader John Flanagan. Committee chairs receive stipends. Vice chairs do not. A senator can receive only one stipend. Senate staffers send documents to the New York State Comptroller’s Office each year listing the leadership position for which each senator should be paid his or her stipend. PolitiFact New York obtained the documents through Freedom of Information requests for each year starting in 2006. The Comptroller’s Office keeps the documents for only five years, so it provided documents from 2012 to this year. The Senate provided documents from 2006 through 2011. The documents show the practice of giving a committee chair’s stipend to a different member of that committee did not start until 2015. The stipends went to the chairs from 2006 through 2014, unless the chair was paid for a different leadership position. The chair’s stipend was not paid to anyone in those cases. Two lawmakers were paid for committee chairmanships they did not hold in 2015 and 2016. Sen. David Valesky was paid the $15,000 stipend of Health Committee Chairman Kemp Hannon. At the time, Hannon collected a $25,000 stipend as assistant majority leader on conference operations. Sen. Andrew Lanza was paid the $18,000 stipend of Codes Committee Chairman Michael Nozzolio, who received $22,000 as the Senate’s majority whip. Valesky and Lanza were listed as vice chairs of the committees. The practice widened in 2017, when six senators were paid for chairmanships they did not hold. Each, except Sen. Patricia Ritchie, was listed as vice chair of the respective committee. Savino received the $18,000 stipend of the Codes Committee chair this year. Lanza, who now chairs the Codes committee, received a $19,500 stipend as assistant senate majority whip. Ritchie, who chairs the Agriculture Committee, was instead paid the Health Committee chair’s stipend this year — a $2,500 increase. Ritchie is listed as deputy vice chair of the Health Committee. Sen. Thomas O’Mara was paid $15,000 as vice chairman of the Transportation Committee. O’Mara otherwise would have received a $12,500 stipend as the Environmental Conservation Committee chairman. Sen. Patrick Gallivan of Elma received $18,000 as vice chairman of the Education Committee, $5,500 more than he would have been be paid for chairing the Crime Victims, Crime, and Correction Committee. Sen. Pam Helming would have received a $12,500 stipend as vice chairwoman of the Crime Victims Committee, the amount Gallivan would have been paid had he not collected the $18,000 from his Education Committee post. Helming decided not to accept the payment. Sen. Jose Peralta, in a twist, took a pay cut. He was paid $12,500 this year as vice chairman of the Energy and Telecommunications Committee. Documents show he was paid $14,500 as the Senate’s minority whip last year, a post he no longer holds. Savino’s view Savino’s spokesperson said the senator was talking about granting stipends to members in general, and not referring specifically to committee vice chairs taking the stipends left available by their committee chairs who took stipends from elsewhere. Stipends have been paid to members for decades. The Legislature started paying stipends to committee chairs in 1976. But Savino’s statement came in reply to an interviewer's question about the stipends going to vice chairs. Viewers who watched the interview could not be expected to understand her comment as her spokesperson said it was intended. Our ruling Savino said the practice of giving a committee chairman’s stipend to the vice chair in the State Senate has been "a legislative practice for decades." Records from the state Comptroller’s Office indicate otherwise. The practice did not happen any time in the last decade. It started in 2015. Records do not support Savino’s statement. We rate it False. EDITOR'S NOTE - UPDATE Savino's office issued a statement about our story after publication on July 10. "It’s amazing that an outlet which calls itself Politifact could take liberties with the truth and distort my words based on their ‘perception’ of an interview. Perception is not fact it is opinion, and the truth is that the fragment they plucked from my full statement is as true today as it was when I said it: The practice of the Senate issuing stipends to senators has been a legislative practice for decades. I never said vice chairs were, though they are certainly entitled to under the legislative law. In fact, every senator in our house is entitled to one allowance including every senator in the minority," Savino said in the statement. For context, here's a transcript of the relevant portion of the interview we fact-checked: ERROL LOUIS: For over a week now we’ve been telling you about the controversy involving stipends paid to state senators for positions they do not technically hold. Critics have denounced the practice but Republicans and Independent Democratic Conference leaders say it’s much ado about nothing. My first guest tonight is one of those senators. Democrat Diane Savino is a member of the IDC. She represents parts of Staten Island and southern Brooklyn and she got her stipend as role of vice chair of the senate codes committee. Welcome to the program, thanks for coming back down from Albany. SAVINO: Thanks for having me Errol, how are you? ERROL LOUIS: Oh I’m very good thanks. Tell me what a Vice Chair does. What’s the idea? SAVINO: Well first I want to just reflect on how you opened this. For the past week apparently the Albany press corps has been obsessed with this. When you look at what’s happening in the world, it’s almost as if the world is going to hell in a handbasket. The president is on the verge of being accused of possible crimes where they’re talking about impeachment, the stock market is collapsing today, but yet in Albany there seems to be an obsession with something that has been, in fact, a legislative practice for decades. And in fact when there was a question brought up about it, legal memos were presented and offered to the press to verify that was has been done has been consistent with legislative law and legislative practice for decades, the comptroller’s office verified that that is in fact in legislative law and has been practiced for decades. So, I am mystified as to what the obsession is. Our ruling does not change. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com	None	Diane Savino	None	None	None	2017-07-10T00:00:00	2017-05-17	['None']
pomt-05476	"The federal government owns tens of thousands of properties that are vacant or underused."	true	/georgia/statements/2012/apr/20/tom-graves/graves-tens-thousands-federal-properties-are-vacan/	Nowadays, real estate and the word "glut" come hand in hand. There’s been a glut of homes for sale. A glut in available commercial properties. There’s also a lesser-known glut in properties owned by the federal government that it no longer needs or does not fully utilize. It existed years before the economy took a tumble in the late 2000s, according to the U.S. Government Accountability Office. By U.S. Rep. Tom Graves’ reckoning, the federal real estate glut is serious enough to earn his vote on a bill that aims to save tax dollars by streamlining the process to get rid of those properties. "The federal government owns tens of thousands of properties that are vacant or underused," the Ranger Republican said in a March 20 press release announcing his vote. This number struck your PolitiFact Georgia scribes as high. Hundreds would be well within reason. Thousands? Sure. But tens of thousands? We asked Graves spokeswoman Jennifer Hazelton for more information. She sent us a link to a February 2011 report from the U.S. Government Accountability Office, "Federal Real Property: The Government Faces Challenges to Disposing of Unneeded Buildings." "In fiscal year 2009, 24 federal agencies including the Department of Defense reported 45,190 underutilized buildings that cost $1.66 billion annually to operate," the report stated. Underutilized buildings are those that are not being used to their fullest capacity. Some buildings owned by the federal government are even sitting empty. We cross-checked the data with the General Services Administration, which is often billed as the government’s landlord. According to its yearly property reports, the number of underutilized buildings numbered 43,360 in fiscal year 2008 and 45,190 in fiscal year 2009. These properties were valued at more than $1.6 billion. The problem of surplus buildings came to the attention of President Barack Obama, who issued a 2010 memorandum directing federal agencies to speed up the process of identifying and getting rid of unneeded space. Obama aims to save at least $3 billion by fiscal year 2012, but the GAO report raised concerns that he may be unable to meet that goal because the process of selling government buildings is tangled in red tape. The bill Graves mentioned in his press release would create a pilot program that would streamline the process. The Excess Federal Building and Property Disposal Act of 2012, or HR 665, passed the U.S. House of Representatives and is before the Senate. A congressional hearing on the issue took place March 22 -- ironically, on excess federal property. The 89,000-square-foot Cotton Annex, which is near the National Mall in Washington, has been unoccupied for about five years, according to Republicans on the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure. Its managers said the building remains a moneymaker because the Federal Protective Service is renting it to inspect delivery trucks. Graves is right. Tens of thousands of federal properties are vacant or underused. He earns a True.	None	Tom Graves	None	None	None	2012-04-20T06:00:00	2012-03-20	['None']
pomt-08887	Cicilline "continues to accept hundreds of thousands of dollars in lobbyist, corporate PAC and insider money to fund his campaign."	mostly false	/rhode-island/statements/2010/aug/01/bill-lynch/lynch-say-cicilline-accepts-hundreds-thousands-don/	With the September primary just six weeks away, the campaign attack machines are heating up, especially in the 1st Congressional District race to replace Patrick Kennedy. Of the four Democratic candidates, Providence Mayor David Cicilline has built by far the biggest war chest, which has -- not surprisingly -- made him the biggest target. Every day, it seems, one of Cicilline's opponents is firing a shot at him. Following a showdown at the first Democratic debate, one of the challengers in the race, former party chairman Bill Lynch, released a statement accusing Cicilline of "hypocrisy" regarding the way political campaigns are funded. The gist of his attack: while Cicilline stressed during the debate that "we will not fix Washington and what's broken in Washington until we break the connection between money and politics ...," he was accepting campaign contributions that did just the opposite. In fact, the second-quarter campaign finance reports were released just a few days after the appearance. "Mayor Cicilline wants the voters to believe he's concerned about the way campaigns are funded, yet he continues to accept hundreds of thousands of dollars in lobbyist, corporate PAC and insider money to fund his campaign," Lynch said in his statement. From the outset, we knew this would be a challenging claim to check, yet also a useful one for readers. The Lynch campaign -- though vocal in their attacks -- went silent when we asked them for a list of these lobbyists, corporate PACs and insiders. Their rationale: it is not appropriate to discuss individual Cicilline donors. But Lynch is making a serious accusation against an opponent. The burden of proof is on him. And a refusal to back up a claim doesn't buy you a pass on PolitiFact. So we elected to look at Cicilline's first- and second-quarter 2010 federal campaign finance filings, those filed since he declared his congressional candidacy in February. Since Lynch used the phrase "continues to accept, hundreds of thousands of dollars," it seemed appropriate to examine the most current reports. Because Lynch would not define what he meant by "insider money," we decided to focus on donations from lobbyists and corporate PACs. Cicilline received $1.16 million in the first and second quarters from more than 750 donors, more than half of whom gave $1,000 or more. That included donations he was able to transfer from his mayoral campaigns. Of that, roughly $44,000 came from Rhode Island and federal lobbyists. How did we arrive at that number? First, we took the contribution lists and cross-referenced them with the secretary of state's list of 2010 registered Rhode Island lobbyists. That tally came to about $41,500, including donations we could definitively attribute to registered lobbyists and people we could identify as the lobbyists' immediate family. We acknowledge that there may be others, but we only included the ones we could confirm. Next we contacted the nonpartisan Center for Responsive Politics in Washington. The group compiles lists of contributions made by a variety of groups including Washington lobbyists. According to their data, Cicilline received $2,400 in donations from federal lobbyists during the first quarter. The center has not yet completed its second-quarter calculations. Together the donations by state and federal lobbyists totaled around $44,000, or just under 4 percent of his total contributions. Lynch also said that Cicilline received contributions from "corporate PACs." Our review showed that of the almost $35,000 Cicilline accepted from Political Action Committees this year, only about $6,000 or so came from so-called "corporate PACs," which we defined as a political committee directly associated with a corporate entity, such as a law firm. We did not include those affiliated with ideological causes such as the Gay & Lesbian Victory Fund, which also gave to Cicilline. Add the lobbyist and corporate PAC contributions and you get just under $50,000. That's roughly 4.3 percent of the $1.16 million he accepted this year. It's hardly the "hundreds of thousands of dollars" that Lynch talks about. But remember, that tally doesn't include the third group that Lynch rails against, the "insider[s]." Cicilline's first- and second-quarter filings clearly show he is accepting money from many well-known Rhode Island political and business leaders. These are, after all, the types of people who generally donate to candidates. The more recent filing also shows he received contributions from donors as varied as "Family Guy" creator -- and RISD graduate -- Seth MacFarlane, Patriots owner Bob Kraft and Boston event planner, Bryan Rafanelli, a Warwick native who has been mentioned lately in news reports as reportedly overseeing former first daughter Chelsea Clinton's nuptials. Does Cicilline, who stressed the need to "break the connection between money and politics," accept money from lobbyists, PACs and insiders? Yes. But Lynch's unwillingness to define what he means by "insider," makes it impossible to do an exact calculation. And based on the limited information we have now, his insistence that Cicilline continues to receive "hundreds of thousands of dollars" can't be verified. Now let's take a look at Lynch's first- and second-quarter federal filings. They reveal that of the almost $186,000 he accepted in contributions from about 160 donors (he also loaned himself $100,000), approximately $7,500 of it came from lobbyists, with all but $1,000 from Rhode Island lobbyists. It does not appear that he took any money from so-called "corporate PACS," though he did receive several union contributions. Add it all up and the sum of donations Lynch accepted from lobbyists equals about 4 percent of the total contributions he received. Cicilline's pockets may be far deeper than Lynch's, but the percentage of donations each of them received from these groups is roughly the same: 4 percent. (And by the way, it's clear that Lynch took money from well-known business and political leaders, the so-called "insider money," that he criticizes Cicilline for accepting). In the end, Lynch made serious accusations and refused to back them up. If he provides us with more information, we'll revisit this item, but for now it gets a Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.

pomt-08485	"Steve Southerland did not pay his taxes in '05, '06, '07, '08 or '09."	false	/florida/statements/2010/oct/11/allen-boyd/allen-boyd-campaign-ad-claims-steve-southerland-di/	In a tight race for a North Florida congressional seat, Democratic incumbent U.S. Rep. Allen Boyd has put out a TV ad accusing his opponent, Republican Steve Southerland, of being a tax scofflaw. The ad begins with a video clip from a Southerland campaign event in Marianna, Fla., on Jan. 18, 2010. Someone in the audience yells out, "Do you pay your taxes?" "That's a great question," Southerland responds. "I do pay my taxes." Then a voice-over states: "Steve Southerland did not pay his taxes in '05, '06, '07, '08 or '09. In fact, Southerland didn't pay his taxes until he ran for Congress. Now he wants to raise sales taxes by 23 percent. You just can't trust Steve Southerland." On the screen, viewers see "Delinquent on his property taxes." And the small print cites the source as the Bay County, Fla., tax collector. We were curious if Southerland is the scofflaw that Boyd suggests. First of all, county tax records indicate Southerland has paid the property taxes for his Panama City home on time and in full for all of the years cited in the ad; and public records show no liens for unpaid federal income taxes. The Boyd campaign explains that the ad is referring to business taxes that Southerland's companies failed to pay ... on time. That's right. It's not that Southerland didn't pay his businesses' property taxes. It's that he didn't pay them on time. In all of the years cited, Southerland did, eventually, pay all of the taxes due, with a penalty and interest. Southerland has an interest in several companies, including the family Southerland Funeral Homes and Machriste Inc. Online records for the Bay County tax collector show that the property taxes for some of these companies were often paid late, and with a penalty. But all of them are currently stamped in red: Paid. Southerland acknowledged they were paid late but said that he always paid the late fees and the account was settled. So why were they paid late? Southerland said it came down to a business choice: whether to pay the tax bill on time or meet obligations to pay salary and benefits to employees. "You have the option, according to the law, of paying them a month or two late" with a penalty and interest, Southerland said. "I paid for my ability to pay it late. I made the same decision small businesses have had to make all around the country." J.R. Starrett, a spokesman with the Boyd campaign, said, "This shows a continued behavior. He doesn't feel like he needs to pay his taxes on time." We spoke to Peggy Brannon, the tax collector for Bay County, who explained that if an owner is more than two months delinquent in paying property taxes, the county sells a tax certificate. The purchaser of the certificate pays the taxes due on the property -- so the county gets its money -- and then gets a share of the interest penalty charged to the owner when they square up on their taxes. That happened a couple times with Southerland's properties, she said. Paying late "is not uncommon" for business owners, said Brannon. And in every case, she said, Southerland has eventually paid his taxes with penalties and interest. "He's all paid up," Brannon said. As for the ad's claim that Southerland "now wants to raise sales taxes by 23 percent," that relates to Southerland's kind words for a plan to replace federal income taxes with a sales tax on retail sales. Supporters of the idea call it "the Fair Tax." At a May 8, 2010, campaign event, Southerland said, "I like the Fair Tax very much," and later added that he thinks the 23 percent sales tax figure often cited in Fair Tax research sounds about right. But he also added that there were some things about the Fair Tax he wasn't sold on. And at a campaign event on July 8, 2010, in Destin, Southerland said pursuing a Fair Tax would not be a "centerpiece of my positions in Congress," (though he repeated that there are "some things about the Fair Tax that I like"). That's a little squishy to be claiming in an ad that Southerland wants to raise the sales tax by 23 percent. Especially without noting the context that if he did, it would be as a replacement to the federal income tax. But our fact-check here is whether Southerland didn't pay his taxes for five years. We think the claim is awfully deceptive. In fact, Southerland always paid his federal income taxes as well as his personal property taxes -- on time and in full. As for the property taxes on some of the companies Southerland owns, he did often pay late. As a result, he paid a fine and interest in each case, and usually squared up in the same year the tax was due. In every case, Southerland eventually fully satisfied his tax obligation. The ad makes it seem like Southerland thumbed his nose at the tax collector and then squared up on five years' worth of taxes only after he'd decided to run for Congress, and that simply is not the case.

pomt-08424	Rand Paul wants "to end all federal faith-based initiatives, and even end the deduction for religious charities."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/oct/19/jack-conway/jack-conway-says-rand-paul-would-end-faith-based-i/	An ad unveiled Oct. 15, 2010, by Democrat Jack Conway so angered his opponent for a Kentucky Senate seat, Republican Rand Paul, that Paul refused to shake hands after a debate two days later. The primary reason for the bad blood was the charge in Conway's ad that Paul, as a college student at Baylor University, had participated in some unorthodox activities, according to an account in GQ. "Why was Rand Paul a member of a secret society that called the Holy Bible 'a hoax' -- that was banned from mocking Christianity and Christ?" said the ad's narrator. "Why did Rand Paul once tie a woman up? Tell her to bow down before a false idol and say his God was 'Aqua Buddha?'" The ad provoked outrage in the Paul camp, and even some liberal commentators protested. The New Republic's Jonathan Chait called it "the ugliest, most illiberal political ad of the year" for coming "perilously close to saying that non-belief in Christianity is a disqualification for public office," an idea that Chait called "a pretty sickening premise for a Democratic campaign." Because the most salacious details of the GQ story were provided by a woman who requested anonymity, we're not going to attempt to fact-check that part of the story. But the ad does contain two policy-focused claims. We'll turn our focus on those instead. After the reference to the "Aqua Buddha" story, the ad asks, "Why does Rand Paul now want to end all federal faith-based initiatives and even end the deduction for religious charities?" We thought we'd take a look. The Paul campaign did not return a telephone inquiry, so we reviewed the sources cited in the ad. To back up the first claim -- that Paul wants "to end all federal faith-based initiatives" -- the ad cited the June 20, 2008, edition of a public-affairs television show called Kentucky Tonight. Paul was one of four guests invited to join an hour-long discussion of the Kentucky state budget. At one point -- it's about 70 percent of the way through the video -- the conversation turns to state budget cuts and the intersection of church-related charity work with state support for social services. Paul offers a note of caution. "You mentioned faith-based intermingling -- government and faith-based," Paul said. "George (W.) Bush did that, and I think it was a horrible mistake. One, I think the money sort of pollutes the mission of a purely Christian organization, or Muslim or whatever organization it is, and it obscures the church-state separation that there really ought to be. We shouldn't have tax money flowing into churches. We should let churches do charity work, and that's wonderful, but they shouldn't be corrupted with government money." This seems to be a pretty clear statement of Paul's views on the subject. The only potential complication we see with the ad's wording is that Paul's statement on Kentucky Tonight was focused on the expenditure of taxpayer dollars. It's possible to envision a partnership between the federal government and a religious group that doesn't involve money, but we think it's reasonable to assume that most would. So the ad's claim seems pretty accurate to us. On the second point -- that Paul would "end the deduction for religious charities" -- the ad cites an Associated Press account. The AP actually ran a half-dozen stories beginning on Oct. 12, 2010, that addressed Paul's support for a national sales tax. The tale gets a bit complicated, so bear with us. On Oct. 12, the AP quoted Paul saying, "The federal tax code is a disaster no one would come up with if we were starting from scratch. I support making taxes flatter and simpler. I would vote for the Fair Tax to get rid of the 16th Amendment, the IRS and a lot of the control the federal government exerts over us." The story attributed the quote to "a written statement distributed by an anti-tax group and verified by his campaign." The Fair Tax would eliminate the federal income tax, employment tax, and estate and gift taxes, replacing them with a 23 percent "national sales tax on the use or consumption in the United States of taxable property or services." Eliminating the federal income tax would also eliminate deductions such as tax deductions for donations to religious charities. Bills proposing to make that change, which have come up annually for years in Congress, have all failed to progress to a full hearing. Nonetheless, Democrats have used the Fair Tax as the basis for many ads against Republicans this year, one of which we recently rated Half True. One day later, Paul began to walk back the comment. The AP reported that "Paul, a limited-government advocate, said he supports a 'simpler tax code' but wouldn't offer specifics about his written comments to an anti-tax group supporting repeal of the 16th Amendment that created the federal income tax. 'I haven't really been saying anything like that,' Paul told reporters following a speech in Henderson as part of his Kentucky bus tour. 'I think it's probably better to go ... with what I'm saying on the campaign trail.'" On Oct. 14, the Owensboro Messenger-Inquirer interviewed Paul before a rally. Paul told the paper that he is for "tax reform in general" but hasn't committed to the Fair Tax. "I'd like to flatten the income tax," Paul said. "The church doesn't ask for more than 10 percent of your income." On Oct. 15, Paul's campaign manager, Jesse Benton, told the AP that a tax reform activist -- former Paul campaign manager David Adams -- had distributed the statement that was the basis for the original AP story, and in so doing, distorted Paul's views on the Fair Tax. "Our campaign respects the Fair Taxation movement, but the Kentucky coordinator got a little overzealous promoting his cause and created a statement that does not accurately reflect Dr. Paul's views," Benton said in a statement to the AP. "Rand knows our tax code is broken and will fight for fundamental reform that both simplifies the system and reduces the financial burden for all Kentuckians. Dr. Paul will study and consider all plans that attempt to do so." The Oct. 15 AP story noted that Adams had said he distributed the statement only after receiving permission from Benton and that Benton had personally verified the statement to the AP for its initial story. Finally, on Oct. 16, the AP reported the existence of a video from a campaign event in February in which Paul told Americans for Fair Taxation volunteer Terry Schmitt, "I'm in favor of any change in the tax code that reduces the overall tax burden. That would include the Fair Tax, changing to a sales tax. One great advantage of it would be no more IRS, no more income tax, no more reams of paper that we all have to deal with." This series of explanations suggests that Paul is backtracking to avoid being associated with a policy proposal that could be unpopular among some voters. But even if he does seem ambivalent, we think there's enough evidence to justify the Conway camp's claim that Paul did support the Fair Tax, at least at one point. That said, we think the Conway ad is somewhat misleading in its description of Paul's views. We don't see evidence that Paul made the religious-charity exemption a target of his opposition. His opposition, such as it was, would have been part of his support for a broader, fundamental tax overhaul. So we think Conway's decision to focus on this narrow aspect of the Fair Tax is misleading. All told, then, Conway is close to accurate on both claims but with a slight exaggeration on the question of religious tax exemptions. Keeping in mind that we're not rating the "Aqua Buddha" portion of the ad, we rate the two policy statements Mostly True.	None	Jack Conway	None	None	None	2010-10-19T10:42:06	2010-10-15	['None']
pomt-11508	In most states, you can buy an assault rifle with no proof of ID, but in every state, you need proof of ID to vote.	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2018/feb/22/viral-image/fact-checking-meme-id-requirements-buying-guns-vot/	After a teenage gunman killed 17 people at a high school in Parkland, Fla., Americans of all political persuasions flocked to social media to express their views on gun policy. On the pro-gun control side of the argument, Areva Martin, an author and TV commentator, tweeted a graphic that showed in most of the country, it is harder to vote than it is to buy an assault rifle. She shared the following graphic with the comment, "Just let this sink in! #FloridaSchoolShooting #Florida #GunReformNow." See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com However, a closer look at both gun policy and election law suggest some important caveats that the graphic leaves out. (Martin did not reply to an inquiry from her representative.) Where the graphic came from Unlike many viral images we see, this one provided its sourcing. It cited an article by Alex Seitz-Wald in Salon.com and the liberal Center for American Progress. The chart was put together from elements of the Salon article by Adam Peck, an editor with the website ThinkProgress, which is affiliated with the Center for American Progress. Peck told PolitiFact that the graphic was originally created to be embedded in a separate Think Progress article. The accompanying ThinkProgress article "was our opportunity to provide readers with the kind of information and nuance that simply don't work in a visual capacity," Peck said. "Obviously, the pitfall is that those graphics can be easily divorced from their companion articles, losing whatever nuance we set out to provide." Also important to note: The Salon article, the ThinkProgress article and the graphic were all published in 2013. (Seitz-Wald has been at NBC News since 2014.) So the underlying data is five years old. The meme’s re-emergence means there’s been a game of telephone, with notable context falling by the wayside. See Figure 3 on PolitiFact.com Student survivors of the shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School gather at the capitol in Tallahassee, Fla., on Feb. 21, 2018. (AP/Mark Wallheiser) IDs to buy guns You wouldn’t know it from the graphic, but whether an ID is required for a gun sale depends on who is making the sale. Under federal law, federally licensed gun dealers, importers and manufacturers must run background checks for sales to an unlicensed buyer. Specifically, a potential purchaser must show identification, complete a federal document known as a Form 4473, and pass a National Instant Criminal Background Check System check. Where the meme has a point is that in the states that didn’t pass a tougher law, unlicensed private sellers are exempted from having to complete the background check process. Commonly, such unlicensed sellers operate from gun shows or flea markets, although a licensed dealer selling from a show would have to run the background check. "For anyone who thinks he or she might not pass a background check, or is looking to circumvent any waiting period, they can bypass both in a majority of states," said Peck, the graphic's creator. As Seitz-Wald noted in his article, states can add their own restrictions on top of these requirements. At the time the article was written, only about a third had done so. Since then, Oregon and Washington have begun requiring background checks (and thus an ID) on all gun sales, including private transfers. This distinction — between the rules for licensed sellers and for unlicensed sellers — didn’t make it into the meme. That matters. While it is possible in many states to buy a firearm without an ID by seeking out an unlicensed seller, such purchases account for a fraction of all sales. Gun shops and other types of brick-and-mortar stores — where background checks are required — account for a majority of purchases. A research paper published last year in the Annals of Internal Medicine found that of the 70 percent of gun transfers studied that were purchases — as opposed to gifts and inheritances — 53 percent were purchased from stores and 17 percent were purchased from family, friends, online or gun shows. Those percentages have increased over time. In the past two years, 64 percent were purchased at stores. In other words, it’s certainly possible to purchase a gun without an ID in many states, but in reality, a large majority of purchases are done with IDs and background checks. States requiring IDs for voting The graphic is more problematic on the point that in no state can you vote without proof of ID. It’s certainly true that a number of states have requirements for voters to hand over a government-issued photo ID in one of just a few categories, such as driver’s licenses. The strictest of these include Georgia, Indiana, Kansas, Mississippi, Tennessee, Virginia and Wisconsin, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. Other states also have ID requirements to vote, but in many cases, they allow easier-to-obtain paperwork, including documents without a photograph in some cases. Some of the valid documents, depending on the state, include student ID cards, utility bills, bank statements, paychecks, government checks, Medicare or Medicaid cards, employer ID cards, or a bank or debit card. Finally, there are 16 states that do not currently require documents at polling booths at all. They are California, Illinois, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, Nebraska, Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, North Carolina, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Vermont and Wyoming. So the notion that every state requires an ID to vote is incorrect. If the graphic had said that an ID is required to register to vote, it would have been somewhat more accurate. Under the federal Help America Vote Act, every state must request identification when registering first-time voters who did not register in person and did not provide identification when filling out the mail-in registration form. For these voters, a wide variety of documents are accepted for registration; many states allow some of the non-photo IDs cited above to serve that purpose. Our ruling The viral image said that in most states, you can buy an assault rifle with no proof of ID, but in every state, you need proof of ID to vote. It is indeed possible to buy an assault rifle without an ID if you go to a gun show — but the graphic neglects to mention that these sales are the exception rather than the rule. A significant majority of gun purchases are made in transactions that require ID and a background check. As for the voting claim, some states have imposed strict photo ID laws at the voting booth. However, the graphic ignores that about one-third of states require no ID at all to vote, and that many of those that do require identification allow a range of documents to serve that purpose, including student IDs, utility bills and debit cards.

pomt-01763	Says Rep. Bruce Braley, D-Iowa, missed "79 percent of veterans affairs committee hearings."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2014/jul/30/concerned-veterans-america/how-many-veterans-affairs-hearings-did-bruce-brale/	Congressional oversight of veterans affairs isn’t looking so good in light of news about the VA and delayed access to health care. Now U.S. Rep. Bruce Braley, a Democrat running for Senate in Iowa, is getting bad press for missing a large number of committee hearings. Braley is running against Republican Joni Ernst for the U.S. Senate seat held by Democrat Tom Harkin. But the television ad attacking him comes from Concerned Veterans for America, an advocacy group with funding linked to the Koch brothers. Braley "skipped an astonishing 79 percent of veterans affairs committee hearings. He even skipped an important VA reform hearing to attend three fundraisers," the ad says. That number sounded high to us, so we decided to check it out. Separately, we looked at whether he skipped a hearing to attend three fundraisers (more on that in a bit). What did he miss? Concerned Veterans said the missed meetings happened between 2011 and 2012 -- the years he was on the committee. There were 21 hearings of the full committee during those two years, according to a list maintained by the U.S. Government Printing Office. We went through all 21 transcripts and found that Braley was present for only five hearings. This means Braley missed about 76 percent of the hearings.That’s pretty close to 79 percent. This number doesn’t give quite a full picture of Braley’s participation. He’s a member of the Subcommittee on Economic Opportunity, which has hearings of its own. In the same 2011-12 time frame, there were 17 subcommittee hearings, and Braley was at 15 of them. Adding up the full committee and subcommittee hearings, Braley could have attended 38 hearings. He was present at 20 of them, which is an attendance rate of 53 percent and an absent rate of 47 percent. Why did he miss them? We asked Braley’s campaign why he missed so many meetings, and they pointed to several conflicting hearings and other responsibilities that explained his whereabouts for five of the full commitee hearings. For example, on April 5, 2011, he attended a hearing of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee (of which he was also a member) on the cost of postal service workers. The hearing took place at the same time as the VA committee hearing that day. During a May 3, 2011, hearing, he was meeting with Andrew Connelly, a disabled veteran from Iowa who spoke later that day at an Economic Opportunity subcommittee hearing, where Braley was also present. And on the morning of June 6, 2012, Braley met with another wounded veteran from Iowa at Walter Reed Military Medical Center in Virginia instead of attending a hearing. The Concerned Veterans for America ad says he missed the meeting on Sept. 20, 2012, for three fundraisers, but we found that to be Mostly False. He was actually at an oversight committee hearing about Fast and Furious, in which federal agents traced weapons sold and brought into Mexico. Two of the hearings -- Aug. 13, 2012, and Oct. 3, 2012 -- only had two or three representatives in attendance. The Aug. 13 hearing took place in Orlando, and the only representatives there were Chairman Jeff Miller, Corinne Brown and Gus Bilirakis -- all from Florida. On Oct. 3, the House was not in session, so many representatives were not in Washington. Committee hearings are rarely well-attended, unless the members of Congress think it will get public attention, said Sarah Binder, a political science professor at George Washington University and a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution. Representatives have busy schedules and have to allocate their time accordingly. They might decide that a particular hearing is not as important as another hearing, meeting with constituents or raising money for their next campaign. "Given that Braley has a high attendance rate for his subcommittee assignment, that strikes me as evidence of taking his committee responsibility seriously," Binder said. Is this normal? We wondered if it’s normal for a member of Congress to miss so many committee hearings, so we calculated the attendance ratings for all 26 members of the VA committee in 2011-12. Eleven members, Braley included, were absent for more than 50 percent of full committee hearings. The only representative with perfect attendance was Miller, the chairman. Here are the three representatives with attendance records as bad or worse than Braley’s: Cliff Stearns, R-Fla., missed 76 percent; Mark Amodei, R-Nev., missed 80 percent; Linda Sanchez, D-Calif., missed 86 percent. We compiled the attendance records for all 26 members, see them here. Braley also had the highest attendance other than the chair for the Economic Opportunity subcommittee, missing only 12 percent of those hearings. Four of the subcommittee’s nine members were absent for more than 50 percent of all subcommittee hearings. Our ruling A Concerned Veterans ad said Braley "skipped an astonishing 79 percent of veterans affairs committee hearings." When we analyzed the hearing transcripts, we found that he had missed about 76 percent of all 2011 and 2012 full committee hearings. He did, however, attend almost all of his subcommittee hearings.

However, one blog’s claim that a Mary Jane-induced donut shortage caused Tim Hortons stores across the country to close early is laughable. Still, the story has been shared more than 100,000 times on Facebook, so we thought we’d clear the air, just in case. This story was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) On Oct. 17, 2018, Canada became the second country in the world to legalize recreational marijuana. The first was Uruguay. In the days that followed, several false news stories surfaced on social media speculating about repercussions of the legalization. The donut shortage story was published on World Daily News Report, and relied on quotes from a spokesman for Tim Hortons named James Dyke. There is no evidence that such a spokesman exists — Dyke has not been quoted in any other article and is not listed as an author on any Tim Hortons press releases. The World Daily News Report site includes a disclaimer that says all of its stories are fictional and that "all characters appearing in the articles in this website – even those based on real people – are entirely fictional and any resemblance between them and any persons, living, dead, or undead is purely a miracle." The first day of marijuana sales did result in shortages — of cannabis, not donuts. Customers in Quebec waited in lines for hours. Cannabis-selling websites glitched, sold out of product and crashed.

pomt-10531	"When we've got CEOs making more in 10 minutes than ordinary workers are making in a year ... then something is wrong."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/feb/28/barack-obama/certainly-steve-jobs-is/	Celebrating a primary victory, Sen. Barack Obama roused the crowd at a Feb. 19, 2008, rally in Houston, Texas, when he went after inequities in corporate America. "I believe in the free market," Obama said. "I know Texans believe in entrepreneurship. We are an independent and a self-reliant people. We don't believe in government doing what we can do for ourselves." "But when we've got CEOs making more in 10 minutes than ordinary workers are making in a year... " pause for applause from the audience, "and it's the CEOs who are getting a tax break and workers are left with nothing, then something is wrong, and something has to change." Finding information to evaluate Obama's statistic was not easy. His campaign did not respond to inquiries. And we couldn't locate any reports supporting the "making more in 10 minutes" idea. Here's what we did find: • A 2007 report from the independent Institute for Policy Studies and the independent nonprofit United for a Fair Economy, "Executive Excess 2007," that states: "CEOs of large U.S. companies last year made as much money from just one day on the job as average workers make over the entire year." So, not 10 minutes, but in the ballpark. • A 2007 report in Forbes magazine which states that the average salary for the 20 highest-paid chief executives is $145-million. Separately, in a 2007 U.S. Census report, we find that the median annual income for a full-time worker is $35,603. Assuming a 40-hour work week, with 50 work weeks a year, the 10-minute average salary of the highest-paid CEOs is $12,083. At this salary, it would take 30 minutes to exceed the annual salary for a full-time worker. • Now in the same Forbes report on CEO compensation, Apple CEO Steve Jobs is listed as the highest-paid boss of America's 500 biggest companies at $646.6-million a year. Doing the math on Jobs' income, he makes $53,883 in 10 minutes. That's $18,280 more than the average worker's annual salary. So, while it's fair to say some CEOs "are making more in 10 minutes than ordinary workers are making in an entire year," Obama would be on safer ground if he qualified his statement.

pomt-11338	"Nancy Pelosi vows Democrats will raise taxes if they take back the House."	half-true	/punditfact/statements/2018/apr/09/blog-posting/did-nancy-pelosi-vow-raise-taxes-if-democrats-take/	A headline popped up all over the Internet recently: "Nancy Pelosi vows Democrats will raise taxes if they take back the House." How accurate is it? Based on the accompanying article -- originally published by the Daily Caller News Foundation, a conservative online publication -- as well as by additional reporting by PolitiFact, the headline outlines a scenario that’s possible but speculative. The April 5 article that accompanied the headline was prompted by a town hall on April 4 headlined by Pelosi and her fellow House Democrat from California, Ted Lieu, in Culver City, Calif. At the event, Pelosi and Lieu criticized the tax bill that passed last December, one advanced exclusively with Republican votes in Congress. At one point, the article noted, Pelosi used a Democratic talking point that we have previously rated Half True -- that "over 80 percent of the benefits go to the top 1 percent." That figure is correct for the tax law’s impact by 2027, but through 2025, the top 1 percent’s share is much smaller -- roughly 20 percent to 25 percent. However, the Daily Caller article did not specifically quote Pelosi promising to raise taxes. Rather, it offered a more nuanced scenario. Pelosi didn’t offer specifics when asked if Democrats would re-work the bill from scratch or focus on specific portions, saying instead her party would work openly with Republicans to reach a deal. "One of our complaints about what they did with the tax bill is they did it in the dark of night with the speed of light," the California Democrat said. "We’ll sit down at the table and say … what would be a tax bill that creates growth, that creates good paying jobs as it reduces the deficit?" she said. "It’s not about chipping at this piece or that piece, it’s about a comprehensive look at what our tax policy should be for the future," she added. In other words, at the Culver City event, Pelosi said she would be willing to work with Republicans on overhauling or overturning the law in an unspecified way. Any tax hikes that result would be subject to negotiation -- and the changes could plausibly include cuts compared to current law for some Americans, rather than tax increases. Other remarks by Pelosi not included in the article reiterate this point. "We can do, that we must do that, in a bipartisan way," she said. "It’s not about chipping at this piece or that piece, it’s about a comprehensive look at what our tax policy should be for the future." Meanwhile, the article cites an earlier and more specific remark by Pelosi: Pelosi’s comments Wednesday come after she said in February that Democrats would have to "replace and repeal" the GOP tax bill once retaking the House. "It may have to be a ‘replace and repeal’ — replace them and repeal the bill," Pelosi said. But even this approach doesn’t guarantee tax hikes, much less universal ones. Mark Mazur, vice president for policy at the Urban Institute-Brookings Institution Tax Policy Center, told PolitiFact that if you simply repeal the tax law — "which really is impossible, since some of the provisions already have had an effect" — you would raise revenue, or, in common parlance, raise taxes. By contrast, Mazur said, "if you replace it, then the character of the replacement determines whether the combined package raises or loses revenue." Pelosi's office told PolitiFact that the headline "an inflammatory misrepresentation." They pointed to a Pelosi press conference in December where she said any changes she'd seek "would be bipartisan, open, transparent, and unifying as we go forward to strengthen middle class tax cuts." Bottom line: It’s premature to say a future Democratic-led change to the tax law would definitely raise taxes. It would also be premature to say which, if any, taxpayers would see an increase under a potential Democratic bill. Democrats could vote to raise taxes in a way that keeps or expands the current cuts for lower- and middle-income taxpayers but raises taxes on the highest segment of earners. That’s an important piece of context missing from the headline. One proposal cited in the article was offered in March by Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y. Schumer proposed raising the corporate tax rate from the newly enacted 21 percent level to 25 percent, by raising the top tax bracket back to 39.6 percent, by bringing back the alternative minimum tax, and by getting rid of the carried-interest tax loophole that benefits fund managers. The recent tax bill did not address the carried-interest provision. Each of these provisions cited by Schumer would target wealthier taxpayers. To reach the conclusion of the headline requires "a lot of reading between the lines," said Patrick Newton, a spokesman for the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget. One last point: It takes more than a Democratic House to make changes to tax law. President Donald Trump has hailed the 2017 tax cut bill as one of his signature achievements. It’d be highly unlikely he would sign off on any major changes, or that Congress would be able to overturn a presidential veto. In that sense, the entire discussion is somewhat academic. Our ruling A widely circulated headline in social media said, "Nancy Pelosi vows Democrats will raise taxes if they take back the House." While any change to the tax law passed last December risks raising taxes on someone, the headline does not reflect that it could also lower taxes on others. In reality, Pelosi has not specified what changes she would like to see in a replacement bill, so saying that she has vowed to raise taxes is an exaggeration. Meanwhile, if Schumer’s proposal ends up being the model that Pelosi pursues, that approach could easily keep or expand tax cuts for lower- and middle-income taxpayers while raising them on wealthier Americans.

pomt-07019	"Under Gov. Rick Perry’s leadership [Texas] has created more jobs over the last decade than the rest of the states combined."	mostly false	/virginia/statements/2011/jul/06/bob-mcdonnell/mcdonnell-says-texas-under-gov-perry-has-created-h/	Gov. Bob McDonnell spends plenty of time talking about Virginia’s job climate, but he expanded his horizons in a recent op-ed piece for The Wall Street Journal. The governor hailed the economic record of Texas, run by his fellow Republican, Gov. Rick Perry. "Under Gov. Rick Perry’s leadership [Texas] has created more jobs over the last decade than the rest of the states combined," McDonnell wrote. Perry has led Texas since December 2000, when he replaced then-Gov. George W. Bush, who resigned to prepare for his presidency. Perry is considering running for president next year. McDonnell’s column urged the GOP to nominate a governor for the White House, saying state executives have practical experience dealing with the economy and balancing budgets. McDonnell lauded the records of several Republican governors -- including his own. We wondered if Perry’s record on creating jobs matched McDonnell’s claim. Tucker Martin, McDonnell’s director of communications, said the statement was based on data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the federal government’s clearinghouse for employment statistics. He also cited a May report by The Business Journals that tabbed Texas as the runaway leader in job creation. Our research took us down a road traveled by PolitiFact Texas in examining various claims from Perry that most of the jobs created in the U.S. are in the Lone Star State. PolitiFact Texas has debunked several of these eye-popping claims, noting that they are based on statistics from a minority of states that have had overall job gains in recent years. According to the BLS, Texas had a net gain of 907,000 jobs between December 2000 and December 2010. The entire payroll in the U.S. grew by 1.6 million jobs during the span. That means of the 19 states that gained jobs during the first decade of Perry’s governorship, including the District of Columbia, Texas accounted for 56 percent of the gain. But McDonnell did not say it that way. He wrote that Texas "has created more jobs over the last decade than the rest of the states combined." The statistics he cites ignore any positions created in the 31 states where job losses outnumbered gains over that time, and it also fails to capture all positions added in states with job gains. Consider California, for example, which had a net loss of 340,000 jobs over the decade. Does that that mean no positions were created in California during the span? Of course not. But the figures McDonnell cites do not count any of the new jobs created at Facebook and Google because California’s overall employment dropped. By excluding all states with net job losses -- regardless of any gains in those states -- the Texas share of new jobs in the U.S. is overblown. Michael Brandl, a professor at the University of Texas-Austin’s business school, has been critical of Perry’s use of these statistics to bolster his job-creating credentials. "To say it’s misleading is to be kind," he told PolitiFact Texas in 2009. "It’s just not true." Brandl was more circumspect when we recently asked him to assess McDonnell’s claim. He told us it is risky when the Virginia governor -- or anyone -- uses one statistic to make broad inferences about the economy. "You have to be careful of using one number or data point and thinking it gives insight," he said. A broader look shows Texas has thrived over the last decade, but not at the miracle level McDonnell suggests. Texas is the nation’s second-most populous state, behind California. The Lone Star state saw a 9.2 percent increase in private-sector jobs, good for sixth-highest in the country. Utah, Montana, Alaska, North Dakota and the District of Columbia beat the Texans, with North Dakota’s private sector job levels growing by almost 20 percent in 10 years. Texas had an 8.0 percent unemployment rate in May, below the national mark of 9.1 percent, but worse than that of 23 other states. Virginia’s unemployment rate of 6.0 percent tied for 7th with Hawaii, Iowa and Wyoming. Let’s review. McDonnell wrote that under Gov. Perry, Texas "has created more jobs over the last decade than the rest of the states combined." But the Virginia governor used net job numbers. Those are different from job creation figures, which are not compiled by the BLS or other national authority. So using net job numbers and calling them job creation figures is a case of comparing apples to oranges. We rate McDonnell’s claim Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.

pomt-04173	"Scott Walker has even removed the 250,000 jobs promise from his website."	false	/wisconsin/statements/2012/dec/17/mike-tate/wisconsin-gov-scott-walker-erased-his-pledge-creat/	Gov. Scott Walker is nearly halfway through his four-year term, and has a long way to go to meet his campaign promise to create 250,000 private-sector jobs. We keep track of the promise (and many others) on the Walk-O-Meter. The most recent update, which includes the October 2012 monthly jobs report, shows the state has created 25,411 private-sector jobs under Walker’s watch -- roughly one-tenth of the total he promised as a candidate in 2010. As state Democrats look toward the 2014 election, it’s natural they would focus on this part of Walker’s record. Party Chairman Mike Tate launched an early volley in a Dec. 3, 2012 blog post criticizing management of the Wisconsin Economic Development Corp., which Walker chairs. The WEDC, which under Walker replaced the Commerce Department, is looking into millions in loans it made that have fallen behind or gone unpaid. "Scott Walker’s WEDC was supposed to help create 250,000 new jobs and be the symbol of his first term in office," Tate wrote, then added: "Scott Walker has even removed the 250,000 jobs promise from his website." Whoa. Has Team Walker scrubbed the top campaign promise from his website? Asked to provide backup for Tate’s claim, party spokesman Graeme Zielinski referred us to several online posts made by Walker’s campaign, including a March 2010 YouTube video on the topic. Another link was to a 2010 appearance by Walker on the "Upfront with Mike Gousha" show on WISN-TV (Channel 12) in Milwaukee, where he discussed the promise. But these videos shed no light on Tate’s claim about the promise now being gone from the website. Indeed, they are from before Walker took office. Zielinski also pointed to a change on Walker’s campaign web page, saying: "On Scott Walker's issue page there is one bullet that talks about Jobs. It's now called, Putting Wisconsin Back to Work. This is a complete different page than the one he had on his website previously, called Scott’s Plan to to Help the People of Wisconsin Create 250,000 Jobs." Fair enough. But Tate’s claim wasn’t that Walker had downplayed the promise. It was that he removed it entirely from his web page. We examined the site. The "Putting Wisconsin Back to Work" section discusses steps Walker has taken to improve employment. It makes no mention of the 250,000 jobs claim. However the promise is mentioned in the site’s "About Scott" section, where it says: "Governor Walker remains committed to helping Wisconsin's private sector create 250,000 jobs by 2015." The site might have changed, but the promise hasn’t been removed. We also did a Google search of Scott Walker. That campaign site and Walker’s official site turned up in the first screen. The governor’s official site stands behind the promise even more prominently, on the first page: "250,000 new jobs in four years -- It’s an ambitious goal, but one that Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker says is achievable." As we’ve followed the jobs promise, we have noted many steps the administration has taken to downplay the promise, or efforts to measure it. For instance, shortly after Walker took office, the state jobs tracking agency first celebrated each month’s jobs reports. Now, the monthly reports come with long explanations about why the month-to-month data can’t be trusted. Our rating Tate said Walker has removed the promise to create 250,000 jobs from his website. We checked the campaign website and the governor’s official state website. The promise is there, and is repeated in numerous videos and news clippings. Even a simple search leads to that conclusion. We rate the claim False.	None	Mike Tate	None	None	None	2012-12-17T09:00:00	2012-12-03	['None']
pomt-02577	Says "Barack Obama has gone from blaming George W. Bush to plagiarizing George W. Bush."	false	/punditfact/statements/2014/jan/29/marc-thiessen/gop-speechwriter-obama-plagiarized-george-w-bush/	Republicans might not have heard much to cheer about in President Barack Obama’s State of the Union address, but a former GOP speechwriter almost felt flattered. Marc Thiessen was the lead writer for President George W. Bush’s 2007 State of the Union speech, and he said he found the similarities between the two speeches a bit eerie. "There were lines like, ‘Our job is to help Americans build a future of hope and opportunity," Thiessen told Fox News’ Megyn Kelly. "‘A future of hope and opportunity requires that all citizens have affordable and available health care, extending opportunity and hope depends on a stable supply of energy.’ All of that came from the 2007 State of the Union from George W. Bush. "So Barack Obama has gone from blaming George W. Bush to plagiarizing George W. Bush," Thiessen concluded. Plagiarism -- which is to use the words or ideas of another person as if they were your own words or ideas -- is a fairly serious charge, so we decided to look at the substance behind it. We contacted Thiessen, and he said we should look at his statement in context. "Did Obama copy Bush word-for-word? No," Thiessen told us. "But Obama clearly lifted the repeating theme of his address from Bush's 2007 State of the Union. In Obama's case, it's significant because he is abandoning a liberal theme that was not working (income inequality) in favor of a conservative theme that does (opportunity)." Thiessen said this wasn’t the first time he felt Obama borrowed heavily from Bush. He said it happened before in an Obama speech on Syria. In this case, Thiessen does well to back away from the zinger he delivered on television. Jonathan Bailey runs a consulting operation and website called Plagiarism Today. Bailey told us Obama’s speech didn’t have what Bailey would call plagiarism. "It doesn’t appear that any lines were lifted verbatim, or even very close to verbatim," Bailey said. First, Obama never said, "Our job is to help Americans build a future of hope and opportunity," or, "A future of hope and opportunity requires that all citizens have affordable and available health care, extending opportunity and hope depends on a stable supply of energy." So Thiessen is wrong on that point. Even in more isolated contexts, an accusation of plagiarism appears unjustified. On Fox News, Thiessen mentioned the phrases "hope and opportunity" or "opportunity and hope." In 2007, Bush used those phrases seven times. Obama never used either of them. In fact, Obama -- who ran his 2008 campaign on a slogan of "hope" -- didn’t use that word at all. Bush talked about affordable health care twice. Obama never used that term except when he referred to the Affordable Care Act. (Not that the mention of affordable health care should be considered plagiarism.) Bush spoke of "energy" three times; Obama eight. Both presidents also used the word opportunity -- Obama 12 times, Bush nine. The idea of opportunity belongs to both political parties, but it’s a word more typically used by Republicans, both Thiessen and Bailey said. "Much of the language in Obama’s speech took a more conservative tone, using words and terminology commonly associated with Republicans," Bailey said. That said, not everyone agrees that Obama took much of a conservative turn in his speech. According to an analysis from political scientists Benjamin Lauderdale at the London School of Economics and John Sides at George Washington University, Obama’s tone was not much different than it had been in previous years. For fun, we used the website Wordle to generate diagrams showing how many times the two presidents used certain words in their speeches. The similarities and differences are fairly obvious. In 2007, war and terrorism were more pressing than work and jobs are in 2014. In the scheme of things, both presidents invoked "opportunity" about the same number of times. Most common words in President George W. Bush’s 2007 State of the Union address Most common words in President Barack Obama’s 2014 State of the Union address Our ruling Thiessen said that Obama had gone from blaming George W. Bush to plagiarizing him. Thiessen himself says he didn’t mean that Obama copied Bush; rather, that Obama took the theme of opportunity from Bush. Even if Obama did emphasize a theme Republicans identify with, that in no way matches the popular, or legal, understanding of plagiarism. At PunditFact, we understand that words can be delivered for effect, but we also uphold the principle that words matter. We rate this claim False.

pomt-10083	Obama would "experiment with socialism."	pants on fire!	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/dec/03/sarah-palin/the-mccain-campaign-experiments-with-dishonesty/	(Published Oct. 27, 2008) Sen. John McCain's campaign has seized on Sen. Barack Obama's offhand remark that he wants to "spread the wealth around" to allege Obama is a socialist. Even in the context of a heated presidential campaign, that's a remarkably incendiary accusation. It's become a standard part of the McCain campaign rhetoric, uttered by surrogates and candidates alike. Gov. Sarah Palin's remarks in Springfiled, Mo., are a good example: "Senator Obama says that he wants to spread the wealth, which means — you know what that means," she said at a rally on Oct. 24, 2008. "It means that government takes your money, (handed) out however a politician sees fit. Barack Obama calls it spreading the wealth, and Joe Biden calls higher taxes patriotic. And yet to Joe the Plumber, he said it sounded like socialism. And now is not the time to experiment with socialism." She has repeated the line in Nevada, New Mexico, Colorado and most recently in Leesburg, Va., on Oct. 27, 2008. It consistently evokes boos and jeers from a crowd protective of the American system of government. But is Palin stoking their anger honestly? Socialism refers most commonly to a system in which the government owns the means of production and distribution of goods. That is, the state truly is responsible for creating and spreading the wealth. Let's look at the root of Palin's claim — Obama's Oct. 12, 2008, exchange with plumber Samuel J. Wurzelbacher, who has come to be known simply as Joe the Plumber — and see if that's what Obama was suggesting. Wurzelbacher approached Obama on the street in his Holland, Ohio, neighborhood, and said he was close to buying a plumbing company that makes $250,000 to $280,000 a year. He complained that Obama would tax him more, punishing his success. Obama responded that he was raising the top tax rate so he could decrease taxes for those who make less than $250,000. "It's not that I want to punish your success," Obama said. "I just want to make sure that everybody who is behind you, that they've got a chance at success too." "Seems like you would be welcome to a flat tax then," Wurzelbacher said. "You know, I would be open to it except for here's the problem with a flat tax," Obama countered. "You'd have to slap on a whole bunch of sales taxes on it. And I do believe that for folks like me who have worked hard but, frankly, also been lucky, I don't mind paying just a little bit more than the waitress who I just met over there who — things are slow, and she can barely make the rent. Because my attitude is if the economy's good for folks from the bottom up, it's going to be good for everybody. If you've got a plumbing business, you're going to be better off if you've got a whole bunch of customers who can afford to hire you. And right now, everybody's so pinched that business is bad for everybody. And I think when you spread the wealth around, it's good for everybody." So when Wurzelbacher brought up a flat tax, Obama responded by endorsing progressive taxation – the principle of taxing those with higher incomes at a higher percentage than those with lower incomes. And it is in that context that Obama said he wanted to "spread the wealth." Progressive taxes do indeed spread the wealth a bit. But they do so much more modestly than government owning the means of production. Few serious policy makers — including McCain — consider progressive taxation socialist. In fact, on the Oct. 26, 2008 edition of NBC's Meet the Press , McCain stood by a comment he made in 2000 that "there's nothing wrong with paying somewhat more" in taxes when you "reach a certain level of comfort." "You put into different, different categories of wealthier people paying, paying higher taxes into different brackets," McCain told host Tom Brokaw, as if to say progressive taxes are a no-brainer. Indeed, progressive taxation has been a cornerstone of American tax policy since the federal government first collected an income tax in 1863. It was based on the Tax Act of 1862, which President Abraham Lincoln signed, and which imposed a "duty of three per centum" on all income over $600, and five percent on income over $10,000. Obama's proposed top tax rate of 39.6 percent, (up from today's 36 percent) is considerably higher than that. But it's not particularly high in the context of modern times; as he pointed out to Wurzelbacher, it's about what top earners paid in the Clinton years. In 1987, the top tax rate was 38.5 percent. In 1944, it was 94 percent for the highest portions of high incomes. So no, Obama's tax increase on those making more than $250,000 would not represent a transformation of the U.S. system of government. His desire to "spread the wealth" through progressive taxation makes him no less a capitalist than McCain, or Lincoln. Palin's allegation that Obama wants to "experiment with socialism" seems designed less to inform than to inflame. That's Pants on Fire wrong.

pomt-04998	"Sherrod Brown and his special interest allies in Washington are plotting to spend over $13 million" to defeat Josh Mandel.	half-true	/ohio/statements/2012/jul/19/ohio-republican-party/ohio-gop-claims-sherrod-brown-special-interest-all/	The funding sources of television ads in the U.S. Senate race between Josh Mandel and Sherrod Brown have grabbed the attention of both campaigns, which each side blasting the other for allowing special interest groups to pump millions of dollars into the race. The dispute revolves around the concept of "outside spending" – money poured into elections by groups that are not directly tied to a candidate. These groups often are unbound by campaign finance restrictions, and can accept contributions from anonymous donors. Ohio Democratic Party Chairman Chris Redfern recently highlighted outside money spent to attack Brown. At a July 10 news conference, Redfern claimed that $10.5 million in outside money has been spent against Brown, the Democratic incumbent, often with misleading ads. The Ohio Republican Party fought back of behalf of Mandel, the Ohio treasurer. Spokeswoman Izzy Santa emailed the following: "Sherrod Brown and his special interest allies in Washington are plotting to spend over $13 million, with no end in sight." The feisty exchange prompted PolitiFact Ohio to dig deeper, since outside spending has been an issue in this Senate race. We note here that the context in which the GOP claim was made was a discussion about money from outside special interest groups and Redfern’s criticism that more than $10.5 million had flowed into the state on behalf of Mandel. Justin Barasky, a spokesman for Brown’s campaign, said the GOP’s comparison included more than $10 million worth of ad buys purchased by Brown’s campaign and the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, both of which must publicly report their donors and do not qualify as "outside spending." So before further analyzing the Ohio GOP’s claim, we should provide a more clear definition of outside spending. Richard Briffault, a law professor at Columbia Law School professor who specializes in campaign finance, said there are two schools of thought. "Some people divide the campaign finance world into parts – candidate spending and everything else (‘outside spending’)," Briffault wrote in an e-mail. "Other people divide the campaign finance world into three parts – campaign spending, party spending in support of that party’s candidates, and spending by all other groups (‘outside spending’). "I put myself in the second group," Briffault continued. "Political parties are officially a part of the electoral process. Legislatures are organized by party, candidates are nominated by political parties and they run on party lines… in addition, federal campaign finance law permits party campaign committees to officially coordinate a certain amount of spending with candidates." To sum up, Briffault’s definition of outside spending would exclude candidate committees and party campaign committees, which must disclose their donors. Organizations such as super PACs and unions, however, would be considered outside spending. Those groups are not covered by the same regulations and do not face the same requirements for disclosure. With that established, let’s move back to the Ohio GOP’s claim. We asked Santa for evidence, and she provided the following list of expenditures or planned expenditures: $5.9 million by Brown’s campaign; $5.1 million by the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee; $1.1 million by Majority PAC; $775,167 by Service Employees International Union; and $500,000 by the League of Conservation Voters. Santa also mentioned two outside groups that bought radio airtime to thank Brown, but she did not have any exact figures for those buys. Those figures total $13.4 million, meaning the Ohio GOP has identified enough funding sources to support the amount of spending it claimed. Brown’s campaign confirmed the figures are accurate. But the GOP’s list also supports the counterclaim from Brown’s camp that most of the spending was done by his campaign and the DSCC, and not by outside groups or special interests. Of the more than $13 million, Brown’s campaign and the DSCC accounted for about $11 million. Briffault, the Columbia law professor, said he would not consider spending by the DSCC or Brown’s campaign as outside spending. That would leave about $2.4 million in outside spending on Brown’s behalf, a figure Brown’s campaign does not dispute. So where does that leave us with the Ohio GOP’s statement? Santa, the Ohio GOP spokeswoman, said "Brown and his special interest allies" were planning to spend more than $13 million to defeat Mandel. The claim is literally true because it includes both Brown and his allies. But the context in which it was made is important, too. The dispute between the campaigns revolved around outside money, and Santa’s email, in fact, focused on outside money: "Redfern is the least credible person to be commenting on outside spending when it comes to Ohio’s U.S. Senate race. Sherrod Brown and his special interest allies in Washington are plotting to spend over $13 million, with no end in sight. It’s clear that Brown and his supporters are having to spend this type of money because Brown’s out-of-touch record has exposed him to Ohioans as a 38-year politician and Washington insider who puts politics over people." Santa said her $13 million figure is accurate because it was meant to include spending from all the players contributing to Brown’s re-election, not just outside money. But the conversation, which began with Redfern’s criticism of $10.5 million in outside spending tied to Mandel, was clearly focused on outside spending and not overall spending. (To keep Redfern honest, we asked the Ohio Democratic Party for the funding sources Redfern was talking about. The list included the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, American Crossroads and other groups. Neither Mandel’s campaign nor the National Republican Senatorial Committee – the GOP equivalent of the DSCC – were on the list.) Those details are important to know to be able to put the Ohio Republican Party’s claim in context. On the Truth-O-Meter, the claim rates Half True.

pomt-07928	"[Tailpipe emissions rules], if fully implemented with all the regulations that go with it, they will keep the temperature from rising nearly five one-hundredths of a degree Fahrenheit. By 2050."	true	/virginia/statements/2011/jan/28/ken-cuccinelli/attorney-general-ken-cuccinelli-says-epa-auto-emis/	During a recent speech at a Tea Party rally, Attorney General Ken Cuccinelli took plenty of shots at the Environmental Protection Agency. The Republican, an unabashed critic of global warming claims, called the EPA "the Employment Prevention Agency." While discussing the EPA’s endangerment finding that greenhouse gasses "threaten the public health and welfare of current and future generations," Cuccinelli voiced contempt for new regulations that will limit tailpipe emissions. "It turns out that they believe, that if fully implemented with all the regulations that go with it, they will keep the temperature from rising nearly five one-hundredths of a degree Fahrenheit. By 2050." As the crowd laughed and jeered, the attorney general added, "I might not be able to see my breath by then." Only 0.05 degrees by 2050? Is that really what the EPA was claiming these rules would do? Brian Gottstein, Cuccinelli’s director of communications, referred us to the EPA’s massive document on light-duty vehicle greenhouse gas emission standards. He pointed us to page 4-101, deep in the document. It said: "EPA modeled the anticipated potential effect on climate change and found that in year 2100, the rule would reduce temperature increases by 0.006-0.015 degrees Celsius." Those Celsius figures translate to a range from 0.011 to 0.027 degrees Fahrenheit. Cuccinelli had claimed there would be a 0.05 reduction in temperature increases by 2050. So he actually spoke in the EPA’s favor, overstating the expected reduction and saying it would happen 50 years faster than the agency claims. We also called the EPA and asked them to quantify any temperature reductions that could be expected under the new rules, which affect cars in model years 2012 through 2016. Spokeswoman Enesta Jones e-mailed us a response. "EPA estimated that the 2012-2016 light duty tailpipe standards would reduce the global mean temperature by 0.006 to 0.015 °C by 2100. The approach used to estimate changes in global mean temperature evaluates the impact of the rule’s emissions reductions in the context of global [greenhouse gas] emissions," she wrote. "Although the projected reductions are small in overall magnitude by themselves, they are quantifiable and would contribute to reducing climate change risks." The new EPA limits would establish in 2012 model cars the first-ever caps on carbon dioxide emissions by cars and light trucks. Over the next five years the limits would toughen by about 14 percent. The rules would also push fuel efficiency from 33.8 miles per gallon for passenger cars in the 2012 model year up to 39.5 miles per gallon in 2016. The agency says these new rules would add about $950 to the price of each new car but that the higher price would be offset by lower fuel costs over three to five years. Let’s review. The Virginia attorney general said the EPA’s new tailpipe emissions rules for cars and other light-duty vehicles would reduce temperature increases by 0.05 degrees Fahrenheit. He said this would occur by 2050. The EPA said the reductions would be between 0.011 degrees Fahrenheit and 0.027 degrees Fahrenheit and would occur by 2100. The agency’s claim is even more modest than Cuccinelli suggested. Speaking without notes at a cold outdoor rally, the attorney general came pretty close to hitting the actual EPA claim, and he actually erred in the agency’s favor by overstating the size of projected reductions. He also missed the date, but again erred in the EPA’s favor. Because his mistakes were minor and in the EPA’s favor, we rate his claim as True.

pomt-07226	"It is a greater crime to have an untagged alligator than to host an open house party (for kids)."	true	/florida/statements/2011/jun/02/kathleen-passidomo/illegal-gator-trapping-vs-underage-drinking-partie/	Some Florida parents throw boozy bashes for their teenage children when they graduate from high school under the premise that underage drinking at home is safer than drinking elsewhere. During the spring 2011 session, legislators sought to toughen the penalties for allowing underage drinking. State Rep. Kathleen Passidomo, R-Naples, was among the legislators who voted in favor of the bill, which passed overwhelmingly. In a May 30, 2011, Naples Daily News article, she had a biting way of suggesting the penalty for the crime was too weak. "It is a greater crime to have an untagged alligator than to host an open house party (for kids)," she was quoted as saying. She wasn't the first to make such a statement. Rep. Tom Goodson, one of the bill's sponsors and a Republican from Rockledge, told Florida lawmakers: "I think it's a little bit strange that we protect an alligator more than our children," according to a March 29 St. Petersburg Times article. Goodson legislative assistant Amy Gregory said in an e-mail that Goodson was the first to use the gator comparison during his presentation to committees. Both Passidomo and Goodson made their comments before the bill -- intended to go into effect July 1 -- has been signed. The House approved it 116-0 on April 29, and the Senate passed it 38-1 on May 3. The bill has not yet been sent to Gov. Rick Scott for his signature, according to his spokesman Lane Wright. We wanted to check: Is the penalty more severe for having an untagged alligator than hosting an underage drinking party? And is that about to change? Gator statutes Florida Statute Sections 379.3751 and 379.3752 relate to requirements to take an alligator -- to capture, kill or process it -- and obtain a license. We interviewed two spokespersons at the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission -- Officer Jorge Pino and Katie Purcell -- for some background on gator tagging. According to the commission's website: "Applicants who are awarded a permit must submit payment for two CITES tags and an Alligator Trapping License, or provide proof of possession of an Alligator Trapping License valid through the end of the alligator harvest season. A Florida hunting license is not required to participate in the statewide alligator hunt." The tag -- which hunters must place on the gator -- allows officials to verify that the hunter obtained the proper permit. State statute 379.409 states that anyone who illegally kills, possesses or captures an alligator faces a third-degree felony. Why a felony? "These animals were close to extinction in the early '70s," Pino said. "Because of our efforts to try to bring back the species, we have been very successful. Some people may argue we have been too successful -- there is an abundance of alligators in the state of Florida. ... We need to protect Florida's natural resources." Open house party law Now on to underage drinking: During the 2011 session, the Legislature amended statute 856.015 with House Bill 105. The staff analysis for that bill provides a summary of how the law would change: "Section 856.015, F.S., states that a person in control of a residence who allows an open house party to take place commits a second-degree misdemeanor if they know a minor has possession of or consumed any alcoholic beverage or drug at their residence and the person fails to take responsible steps to prevent the possession or consumption of the alcoholic beverage or drug by the minor. The bill also "amends present law to make a second or subsequent violation ... a first-degree misdemeanor. This bill also provides that any violation ... which results in serious bodily injury or death, will be punishable by a first-degree misdemeanor." This means that before July 1, hosting an open house party for minors could lead to a second-degree misdemeanor. After the law was passed, it became a first-degree misdemeanor in some circumstances -- note that both are lesser crimes than the third-degree felony for gator violations. Now let's compare the penalties: state statute 775.082 states that a third-degree felony is punishable by up to five years in prison. The second-degree misdemeanor carries jail time of up to 60 days, while for a first-degree misdemeanor, someone can land in jail for a year. Sen. Thad Altman, R-Rockledge, one of the sponsors, said in an interview with PolitiFact that legislators debated increasing the penalty of the open house party law to a felony but met some resistance. "Expanding the number of felonies is frowned upon'' by some legislators, he said. "This is a very measured approach.... at least it's one step in the right direction. Hopefully we will save lives of some kids." Broward Public Defender Howard Finkelstein, a Democrat, said comparing the two laws is politically motivated. But he said most criminal laws come down to intent. When someone picks up a gun, points it at an animal and pulls the trigger, the person is intending to kill the animal. "When you host -- no matter how poorly thought out -- a party of underage teenagers where there is drinking, it's clearly not the intent of the homeowner that they get drunk and kill someone," he said in an interview. So illegal gator trapping can send someone to prison for five years while hosting an open house party can -- as of June -- send someone to jail for two months and, possibly after July 1, for a year. Manslaughter charge? But wait -- we're not done yet. If a parent hosts an underage drinking party and one of the teens winds up dead, could the host be charged with manslaughter? That would be one way of imposing a much tougher penalty. Prosecutors have tried the manslaughter route at least occasionally. But in the examples we found, they were not successful: • In May 2010, a jury found Diane Santarelli, a 52-year-old St. Johns County mother, not guilty of manslaughter in the case of two teenagers who died in an alcohol-related car crash after leaving a party hosted by Santarelli and her daughter, according to a May 21, 2010, Florida Times-Union article. The mother was convicted of two lesser offenses: hosting an open house party and contributing to the delinquency of a minor. The article stated: "To be found guilty of manslaughter, the judge instructed the jurors they must determine that she was culpably negligent. Prosecutors had to prove her behavior was gross and flagrant and showed reckless disregard for human life or safety, among other qualifying factors." The article stated: "It was Florida's first manslaughter case dealing with the death of someone underage after consuming alcohol at an open house party." • In 2002, a Miami-Dade grand jury declined to charge a couple with manslaughter after a teenager who attended a party at the couple's home later died in a car crash, according to a July 20, 2005, Miami Herald article. And a jury acquitted the man of the open-house party law. But in that case, there was conflicting testimony about how long the father was present during the party. • The Florida Highway Patrol recommended manslaughter charges for an assistant baseball coach and his roommate for hosting a party in which teens drank hours before three died in a fatal Martin County car crash. But prosecutors said the evidence only supported misdemeanor charges, according to an Aug. 7, 2010, Palm Beach Post article. David "Bubba" Harper, 28, the coach, and Craig Frick, 24, pleaded no contest to the open house party charge. Our ruling Passidomo claimed that "it is a greater crime to have an untagged alligator than to host an open house party (for kids)," referring to a party with underage drinking. Possessing an untagged alligator is a felony that can land someone in prison for five years in Florida. The open house party law as of June 2011 is a misdemeanor -- and if the governor signs a revised version, it will remain a misdemeanor. However, it will move up from second- to first-degree in some circumstances, resulting in a maximum of one year in jail. We rate this claim True.

pomt-05600	Says Congressman Steve Rothman voted against funding for President Barack Obama’s auto bailout and would have let automakers go bankrupt.	half-true	/new-jersey/statements/2012/mar/29/bill-pascrell/bill-pascrell-claims-steve-rothman-voted-against-f/	One of the defining achievements of President Barack Obama’s re-election bid, the federal assistance given to U.S. automakers, is dividing two fellow Democrats mired in their own political battle in northern New Jersey. The campaign of U.S. Rep. Bill Pascrell charges that U.S. Rep. Steve Rothman opposed funding for Obama’s auto bailout, and would have let the industry slide into bankruptcy. The two congressmen are preparing to face off June 5 for the Democratic nomination in the 9th Congressional District. "Rothman voted AGAINST funding for President Obama's auto industry rescue package," Justin Myers, Pascrell’s campaign manager, said in a March 19 news release, "The same guy who touts backing President Obama’s campaign did not even support singularly one of the most important policies that helped turn the economy from the brink of disaster. Just like Mitt Romney, Rothman would have ‘Let Detroit Go Bankrupt’." It’s accurate that Rothman voted against the funding mechanism that would later support the auto bailout, but the Pascrell campaign went too far in suggesting that Rothman did not support assisting U.S. automakers at all, PolitiFact New Jersey found. First, let’s explain the funding behind the auto bailout. The federal assistance provided to U.S. automakers came from the Troubled Asset Relief Program, or TARP, created in October 2008 amid the ongoing financial crisis. Pascrell voted for the bill creating TARP, and Rothman voted against it. TARP was originally designed to assist the nation’s financial institutions, but the administration of President George W. Bush later agreed in December 2008 to use TARP funds for the distressed automakers. That policy continued under Obama. So, Rothman voted against the funding that ultimately went toward the auto bailout. But two points undercut the Pascrell campaign’s argument that "Rothman would have ‘Let Detroit Go Bankrupt’." First, when Rothman voted against the bill creating TARP, the money was intended to purchase troubled assets from financial institutions -- not bail out automakers. According to a September 2009 report by the Congressional Oversight Panel, "Members of Congress who debated this legislation in late 2008 believed they were debating a bill aimed at banks and the financial sector." That’s why it is wrong to interpret Rothman’s no vote as a vote against helping the auto industry. Paul Swibinski, a consultant to Rothman’s campaign, pointed to the original purpose of TARP to show that Myers’ statement is inaccurate. "The TARP bill Steve opposed clearly stated that the purpose of the bill was to purchase troubled assets of ‘financial institutions’ – it made no mention of the auto industry or any manufacturing," Swibinski said in an e-mail. "Steve had no idea that Bush would use a portion of the money for Detroit." About two months after TARP was created, Rothman voted for legislation designed to provide $14 billion in loans to the auto companies. That legislation was blocked in the U.S. Senate, leading the Bush administration to use TARP funds for the auto industry. By supporting that legislation, Rothman indicated his support for some form of federal assistance for U.S. automakers. But Pascrell spokesman Sean Darcy maintained that Rothman was not interested in providing money to rescue the auto industry. "The fact is that he voted against TARP and that money was used to save the auto industry," Darcy said in an e-mail. "So it is not ‘wrong’ to suggest that Rothman would have let Detroit go bankrupt if he got his way." Our ruling In a news release, the Pascrell campaign argued that Rothman "voted AGAINST funding for President Obama's auto industry rescue package" and "would have ‘Let Detroit Go Bankrupt’." It is true that Rothman voted against the bill creating TARP, which was later used to fund the auto bailout. But at the time of that vote, the program was not intended to assist the auto companies. Also, Rothman indicated a willingness to provide federal assistance for automakers through his support of a separate rescue package that was later blocked in the Senate.

pomt-03435	On gay marriage	full flop	/virginia/statements/2013/jun/24/mark-herring/mark-herring-reverses-position-gay-marriage/	Democrat Mark Herring stressed his differences with Republican Mark Obenshain during a recent debate between the attorney general candidates. But Herring said Obenshain was right on one point -- a charge that Herring had switched his stance on gay marriage. We rolled out the Flip-O-Meter to examine the extent of Herring’s change. Let’s journey back in time. In 2003, Herring unsuccessfully ran for the state Senate. He said marriage should be between a man and a woman, according to an Oct. 17 article that year in The Winchester Star. On Feb. 2, 2006, Herring was sworn in as a state senator after winning a special election in Loudoun County. Fifteen days later, he supported a resolution allowing Virginia voters to decide whether there should be a state constitutional amendment banning gay marriage. Virginia law already defined marriage as between a man and a woman. But many referendum backers said the added constitutional amendment would shield the traditional marriage law from judicial tampering. Herring reiterated his support for the amendment during a Sept. 20, 2006, interview with Leesburg Today, saying it was consistent with Virginia’s existing marriage law. In November, the amendment was approved by 57 percent of voters. Herring sang a different tune this spring during his successful Democratic primary campaign for attorney general. On April 5, he released an "Equality Agenda" that said, "Mark Herring believes that civil marriage is a fundamental right, and he supports marriage equality for same-gender couples." Herring pledged to work "to change the current law prohibiting such marriages." Obenshain, a state senator from Harrisonburg since 2004, has been outspoken in his opposition to gay marriage. During a debate this June 15 with Herring, Obenshain said, "I believe marriage is an institution to be entered into between a man and a woman. That’s an issue upon which Mark and I, until at least a few years ago, agreed." Herring acknowledged that "almost eight years ago" he "didn’t really feel comfortable" about gay marriage. "But since that time, I’ve done a lot of thinking about it," he said. "I’ve talked to my friends, my constituents. I talked to co-workers; I talked to my family, including my children. And like millions of Americans and a lot of Virginians, I don’t believe that way anymore and I think it’s wrong. "I don’t believe anybody should be treated as a second-class citizen and I don’t believe that the state should decide who you can and cannot marry. So I support marriage equality and as we work towards marriage equality, there are very specific things I, as attorney general, can do to help protect the rights of gay and lesbian Virginians." For better or worse, Herring has done a Full Flop.	None	Mark Herring	None	None	None	2013-06-24T06:00:00	2013-06-15	['None']
pomt-02314	"Manufacturing wages today in America on a per-hour basis are actually a bit lower than average wages in the economy as a whole."	mostly true	/punditfact/statements/2014/mar/30/steven-rattner/rattner-manufacturing-wages-today-america-lower-av/	Former "car czar" Steven Rattner, who actually hates the nickname he earned overseeing the auto bailout, is pushing back against proclamations of a flourishing American manufacturing industry. Again. Rattner wrote an eye-catching New York Times op-ed in January calling the industry’s post-recession jobs gains a trickle, arguing "we need to get real about the so-called renaissance" partly because wages for auto workers and manufacturers dropped far more than the average private-sector worker since the end of the recession in June 2009. He revisited some of those points in a March 30, 2014, appearance on ABC’s This Week, which took a break from coverage of Russia and the missing Malaysian plane to examine the state of "Made in the USA." "We certainly want these kinds of advanced manufacturing jobs. But remember this, manufacturing wages today in America on a per-hour basis are actually a bit lower than average wages in the economy as a whole," he said. "And what I mean by that is there are lots of really good high-paying jobs in sectors like education, like IT, like health care, service sectors that are not just entry-level jobs, they are really high-paying jobs, and this is our competitive advantage." Manufacturing jobs are typically seen as a source of higher pay for people who don’t earn college degrees, and President Barack Obama put an emphasis on them in his State of the Union address. So PunditFact wondered if Rattner is right: Are per-hour wages in manufacturing a little smaller than average wages for the rest of the American economy? Rattner pointed to U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics data for average hourly earnings of production and nonsupervisory employees in the private sector, which make up about four-fifths of total private-sector employment. The most recent data for February 2014 shows the average hourly private-sector wage was $20.50. The manufacturing industry average was, as Rattner said, a bit lower at $19.43. Hourly wages are almost $3 higher for employees who produce durable goods, such as cars, phones and computers, than those who make nondurable goods, or things like food, gas and clothes. Weekly wages tell a different story, with manufacturers earning almost $122 more a week than the total worker average in February. The reason for the discrepancy between hourly and weekly wages is simple: Manufacturers work more hours. "Anyone can work more hours and make more money," Rattner said. But manufacturers also earn more money an hour when you factor in supervisors. BLS data for February show average hourly earnings are $24.31 for all private-sector employees and $24.72 for manufacturing employees -- the opposite of what Rattner said. Which dataset is better? The question can incite an economists’ quarrel. Dean Baker, a liberal economist and co-director of the Center for Economic Policy Research, took issue with isolating a dataset that excludes supervisors, saying analysts see the distinction as arbitrary and are increasingly using the whole workforce for their research. The manufacturing industry has a lower percentage of production employees (70.1 percent) than the average for the private-sector workforce (82.7 percent), which accounts for the higher pay when using Rattner's measure, Baker said. Rattner argues viewing the data his way is more representative of the typical worker’s earnings without being influenced by the top of the pay scale. Another liberal economist and former Obama administration adviser, Jared Bernstein of the Center for Budget Policies and Priorities, faulted Rattner for excluding benefits on top of wages. Manufacturing workers often have benefits, he said. Another BLS source for wage data (yes, there are a lot of them) shows that when looking at total compensation (wages plus benefits), manufacturing workers earn $35.14 an hour, which is higher than the $28.44 average for careers in the service-providing industry and $29.63 for all private-sector workers in December 2013. "Since it's widely believed that workers trade off benefit pay for lower wages, it's a mistake to just consider wages in this sort of comparison when you're dealing with an industry that pays benefits (as opposed to say, fast food)," Bernstein said. Matthew Lavoie, National Association of Manufacturers spokesman, said 97 percent of the group’s 12,000 members provide health insurance. Rattner conceded manufacturers earn more than service-industry workers when benefits are included in his New York Times column. In our interview with Rattner, he anticipated these objections to his claim. "But my point remains the same: The perception that manufacturing jobs are ‘better’ jobs is out of date," Rattner wrote. "Note also that over the past year, per-hour wages for all industries rose by 50 cents per hour but in manufacturing, they rose by only 21 cents per hour. The trend is not manufacturing's friend, as my NYT piece pointed out." Our ruling Rattner was careful on This Week to single out data for per-hour wages when he argued manufacturers are not paid as much as the rest of workforce. His claim relies on the most recent data for production workers in the manufacturing industry, who earn about $1 less than the average of their private-sector counterparts. However, factoring in supervisors shows manufacturers make 41 cents more per hour. Adding benefits gives manufacturers more of an edge. We won’t take sides and say what dataset we think is best. What we can say is that Rattner makes an accurate point by one measure. On balance, we rate the claim Mostly True.	None	Steven Rattner	None	None	None	2014-03-30T18:16:06	2014-03-30	['United_States']
pomt-02015	The Israelis "gave up 1,000 terrorists in return for one sergeant."	true	/punditfact/statements/2014/jun/08/charles-krauthammer/did-israel-trade-1000-prisoners-one/	The exchange of kidnapped Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl for five high-risk Taliban detainees from Guantanamo Bay has elicited criticism of the Obama administration. Politicians and lawmakers have taken issue with the administration’s action on several grounds, including President Barack Obama’s decision to ignore a law requiring advance congressional notification and the questions surrounding Bergdahl’s original disappearance. But Charles Krauthammer, a conservative columnist and Fox News contributor, has come out supporting Obama’s decision to make the swap, despite concerns that Obama made Bergdahl’s release a highly public "cause for celebration." "We have long engaged -- and all other countries in the West have long engaged -- in hostage swaps where the West always comes out on the short end," said Krauthammer to Fox News host Bret Baier. "And the reason is that we put a value on an individual human life the way that the barbarians at the other end of the table don't." To demonstrate that other western countries have been on the short end of such swaps, Krauthammer cited an Israeli hostage exchange from 2011. "The best example is the Israelis, who gave up 1,000 terrorists in return for one sergeant," Krauthammer said. We decided to see whether Krauthammer’s claim was accurate. We found that it was. In 2006, the Islamic terrorist organization Hamas captured Israeli Sgt. Gilad Shalit after tunneling into Israel and attacking an army outpost. Israel’s first attempt to free Shalit, by launching a military invasion into Hamas-controlled Gaza, failed. Shalit was held captive for five years. During that time, many Israelis pleaded with their government to strike a deal for Shalit’s return. Israel had already failed to secure the freedom of Air Force Navigator Ron Arad, who had crashed his warplane in Lebanon 25 years before his death in 2008 while in the control of Shiite captors. Many Israelis worried that Shalit’s capture would end the same way. But it didn’t. Shalit returned home on Oct. 18, 2011, following Israel’s freeing of 1,027 Palestinian prisoners. It's not clear that all 1,027 were "terrorists," but some were indeed terrorists serving several life sentences for killing Israeli citizens. (In addition, the definition of "terrorist" varies quite a lot depending on who is using the term.) One Israeli minister who voted against the exchange called it "a great victory for terrorism." That fear has been echoed in the wake of the Bergdahl exchange. Krauthammer took issue with such claims in an op-ed in the Washington Post. "The (Obama) administration might have tried honesty here and said: Yes, we gave away five important combatants. But that’s what you do to redeem hostages," Krauthammer wrote. As for what to do with Bergdahl, Krauthammer concludes that the right course is, "Free him, then try him." Our ruling Krauthammer said Israel "gave up 1000 terrorists in return for one sergeant." In 2011, Israel freed 1,027 Palestinian prisoners in exchange for Sgt. Gilad Shalit, who had been held captive by Hamas since 2006. While we can't confirm that all 1,027 were terrorists, some definitely were, and the definition of "terrorist" is often fuzzy. We rate this statement True.

pomt-03025	Terry McAuliffe has "threatened to shut down Virginia’s government if his budget plan isn’t supported."	false	/virginia/statements/2013/oct/11/ken-cuccinelli/cuccinelli-says-mcauliffe-threatened-shut-down-sta/	Amid the partial shutdown of the federal government, Virginia’s major gubernatorial candidates have been trading jabs over which one is likely to bring Washington-style dysfunction to Richmond. At a recent debate, Democrat Terry McAuliffe said GOP rival Ken Cuccinelli "tried to shut down" Virginia government in 2008 by introducing an unsuccessful budget amendment in the state senate that would have defunded Planned Parenthood. We rated McAuliffe’s claim Pants on Fire. This time, we’ll examine a Cuccinelli charge -- made in a radio ad -- that it’s McAuliffe who’s gung-ho for government gridlock. "He’s already threatened to shut down Virginia’s government if his budget plan isn’t supported," the narrator says of McAuliffe. Anna Nix, a Cuccinelli campaign spokeswoman, told us the claim refers to McAuliffe’s repeated vow that he won’t sign a budget as governor unless it provides for Medicaid expansion. An additional 400,000 low-income Virginians would be eligible for the health care program next year under an Obamacare offering. In the first three years the federal government would pay 100 percent of the new cost. After that, the share gradually declines to 90 percent, with the state paying the rest. Virginia lawmakers have not decided whether to expand the state’s program, instead opting for a commission that will recommend efficiencies to Medicaid before a final choice is made. McAuliffe says the state would be foolish to turn down the federal money. Cuccinelli and many Republican legislators oppose expanding Medicaid, saying Washington can’t be trusted over the long term to pay its promised share. Cuccinelli’s spokeswoman noted that McAuliffe said in a June 1 dinner speech to Loudoun County Democrats, "No budget gets done unless the governor signs that legislation. I will not sign a budget in Virginia unless the Medicaid expansion is included. " McAuliffe was quoted by the AARP on Aug. 29 saying he wouldn’t sign budget that doesn’t fund Medicaid expansion. During a Sept. 7 speech in Arlington, McAuliffe said, "My opponent doesn’t support the Medicaid expansion. I have asked the legislators `Please do not send me a bill’ -- because the governor has to sign the bill for the budget to come into effect -- ‘please don’t send me a bill unless the Medicaid expansion is included.’" Growing the program would certainly run into stiff opposition from Republicans in the General Assembly. But is McAuliffe’s pledge not to sign a budget that excludes Medicaid expansion tantamount to a threat to shut down government? Let’s dig deeper. If a governor does not sign a budget bill that has been passed by the General Assembly, it automatically becomes law, according to A.E. Dick Howard, a University of Virginia law professor who helped draft a revised state constitution that voters adopted in 1971. Howard pointed to Article 5, Section 6 of the state constitution, which says if the governor receives a bill while the General Assembly is in session, he has seven days to sign, amend or veto the legislation, or it becomes law. If the governor receives a bill when the General Assembly is not in session, he has 30 days to act before the measure becomes law. Any budget amendments offered by a governor can be defeated by a majority vote in either chamber. Should the governor veto a budget, the legislature can override it with a two-thirds vote of each house. McAuliffe says his budget-signing vow will never come into play if he becomes governor because he’s certain he could convince a majority of legislators to approve Medicaid expansion. "No budget will be shut down in Virginia over the Medicaid expansion," McAuliffe said during a Sept. 25 debate with Cuccinelli. "I will work in a bipartisan way to get it done…so we won’t have any government shutdown." Our ruling Cuccinelli says McAuliffe has threatened to shut down state government. He points to McAuliffe’s repeated promise not to sign a state budget that does not allow for Medicaid expansion. But McAuliffe’s vow, if carried out, would not close Virginia’s government. If a governor does not sign the budget, it automatically becomes law no more than 30 days after the General Assembly sent it to his desk. It’s striking that Cuccinelli, who has served almost four years as attorney general after an eight-year career in the state Senate, overlooked this constitutional provision. We rate his statement False.	None	Ken Cuccinelli	None	None	None	2013-10-11T10:17:37	2013-10-02	['None']
pomt-15294	"Although we have twice the population of Greece, the state of Florida employs three times fewer government employees."	half-true	/florida/statements/2015/jul/22/jeff-atwater/greece-employs-three-times-many-government-workers/	Florida Chief Financial Officer Jeff Atwater capitalized on news about the floundering Greek economy to point out a new report that said the Florida economy was doing just fine. In an "open letter to the people of Florida," Atwater said the Sunshine State had been ranked fifth in fiscal solvency by George Mason University’s Mercatus Center. He then contrasted Florida’s success with the beleaguered European nation. "A country in economic peril, Greece’s priorities have historically been very different from Florida’s," Atwater wrote on July 13, 2015. "For example, Greeks depend much more on their government for employment and services. Although we have twice the population of Greece, the State of Florida employs three times fewer government employees." PunditFact previously confirmed that Greece’s economic output is comparable to Miami, but could that 3-to-1 comparison of public-sector workers be accurate? Yes, if you’re looking at Florida’s direct employees, but experts we talked to said Atwater’s comparison is deeply flawed. Greek tragedy First of all, let’s stipulate that Greece’s population is about 11 million, while the Census Bureau says Florida is now closing in on 20 million, so he’s close on that point. Comparing employment is a bit trickier, since Greece’s public-sector employment has been in flux. To adhere to what its European lenders are demanding, Greece has spent several years trying to cut down its reliance on public-sector jobs. Atwater’s office told us they used 2013 data from Greece’s Ministry of Administrative Reform and E-Governance for Greek government workers (653,746) and the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics’ Current Employment Statistics program for Florida state employees (207,008). Several sources agreed 2015 estimates put the current number of Greek public-sector employees at around 600,000. Florida’s employee numbers have stayed relatively stable in that time frame, with about 208,000 this year, so it looks like the 3-to-1 ratio Atwater cited could stand. But our experts said the CFO is really comparing oranges to olives here. Rollins College business professor James Johnson pointed out that those 600,000 Greek jobs include all government workers -- those paid by the central government and those paid by regional and municipal governments. A better way to measure the state’s government employment would be to add Florida’s 133,000 or so federal workers to Atwater’s 207,000 total, Rollins said. And even more important are the more than 730,000 workers toiling away at the local level. Also, Washington sends money to Florida that directly and indirectly affects workers at the state and local levels. Add that all up, and there are almost 1.1 million government employees on all levels across Florida at any given time. That is quite a bit more than the 600,000 or so Greek government workers. Experts also note that Greek economic woes aren’t entirely about how many people are currently employed by the government. "Greece’s problem was not so much the size of its public sector, but generous retirement benefits, including pensions," Johnson said. Greece doesn’t even top Europe in terms of highest percentage of the workforce employed by the public sector. In 2011, before Greece started cutting workers, it ranked behind Italy, Germany and France. In any event, fairly comparing a single U.S. state with a sovereign nation is largely impossible, considering the different sets of responsibilities each bears, our experts said. Atwater’s office reiterated that it was making a point that the Greek central government is wasteful and poorly run when compared to Florida, but experts told us that it’s difficult at best to draw such parallels. "It’s sort of a totally different system. It is fair to say the state of Florida is more efficient than the country of Greece, but you could say that about any other state," Jupiter-based financial analyst Tom Essaye said. "It would be much more fair to compare Florida to other states than Greece." Our ruling Atwater said, "the State of Florida employs three times fewer government employees" than Greece. Florida does directly employ about one-third as many state government workers as Greece does. But a more reasonable comparison should also include government workers at the federal and local levels -- which means Florida’s overall total of government workers would outnumber Greece’s public-sector employees. The statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of context. We rate Atwater’s statement Half True.

pomt-12108	"Most people on Medicaid are kids, or seniors, or the disabled."	mostly true	/new-york/statements/2017/aug/23/sean-patrick-maloney/most-people-medicaid-are-children-seniors-or-have-/	One-third of New York state residents are on Medicaid, the federal-state program that helps pay for health care. We recently rated that claim True in a fact-check on U.S. Rep. John Faso of the Hudson Valley. Rep. Sean Patrick Maloney, a Democrat whose district neighbors Faso’s, responded to that statement with a claim about the Republican replacement for Obamacare. "I heard [Faso] say recently that too many people are on Medicaid," Maloney said. "I'm just wondering which people he thinks we should throw off their insurance, because most people on Medicaid are kids, or seniors, or the disabled." The replacement would have reduced federal Medicaid spending increases, a measure Democrats oppose. The bill is now in limbo after failing in the Senate last month. Democrats in New York state want to preserve the Medicaid program, often citing the number of people who rely on it. But is Maloney right that most people in the program are children, seniors, or have a disability? National numbers The average monthly Medicaid enrollment in 2016 was nearly 71 million, according to the most recent estimates from the U.S. Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. The agency’s report breaks down the numbers: • 28 million recipients were children. • 5.7 million recipients were age 65 or older. • 10.6 million recipients had a disability or were blind. • The remaining 28.1 million were adults below 65 without a disability or residents in U.S territories. A total of 44.3 million Medicaid recipients were children, seniors, or had a disability in 2016 according to the estimates. That’s almost two-thirds of the Medicaid population. Enrollment data from 2014, the latest official count, shows those groups made up about 65 percent of the Medicaid population that year. That distribution is not out of the ordinary, said Sara Rosenbaum, a professor of health law and policy at George Washington University. "It’s because of how the program is structured and it’s because of who the people are," Rosenbaum said. "For the elderly and the disabled, Medicaid is the means by which we do long term support for services in the United States." Medicaid is used by seniors who need long term care but cannot afford a private insurance plan to supplement Medicare, which does not cover long-term care. People with a disability also rely on the program to cover continuous care. The share of children on Medicaid, meanwhile, is a reflection of how many children live in poverty, Rosenbaum said. "Families know that if your children need insurance, you turn to the Medicaid program," Rosenbaum said. New York numbers Maloney spoke in the context of national numbers, but the same claim would be true for New York state. The average monthly Medicaid enrollment was 6.1 million in New York as of April, according to the state Department of Health. • More than two million beneficiaries in New York are children. • Another 700,527 either have a disability or are blind. • Another 639,488 are people age 65 or older. • The remaining 2.8 million are adults below 65 without a disability. The three categories Maloney mentioned make up more than 3.3 million of New York’s Medicaid enrollees, or about 55 percent. Our ruling Maloney said "most people on Medicaid are kids, or seniors, or the disabled." The word "most" may mean different things to different people. Not even dictionaries are clear, where meanings vary from "the majority of" to "nearly all of." Nationally, two-thirds of people on Medicaid are either children, seniors or disabled, according to data from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. For us, we rate two-thirds as Mostly True. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com	None	Sean Patrick Maloney	None	None	None	2017-08-23T08:36:16	2017-08-03	['None']

The ad is called "Dangerous" and it says Romney and running mate Paul Ryan "both backed proposals that would outlaw abortions even in cases of rape or incest." This is different from previous claims from the Obama campaign. During the summer, the campaign attacked Romney for backing a strict anti-abortion bill with no exception for rape and incest. In fact, that claim was based on a moment in a 2007 debate when there was no mention of exceptions one way or the other and there was no actual bill. The claim was factually inaccurate and distorted Romney's explicit support for precisely those exceptions. The combination of inaccuracy and misdirection earned the Obama campaign a Pants on Fire rating. This time, the Obama team speaks of something broader -- a ‘proposal’ -- and it includes Ryan's position. Recently, the Obama camp tweeted that Ryan would ban all abortions even in cases of rape and incest. The use of the word ‘all’ earned that claim a rating of Half True. That's because Ryan favors an exception where an abortion is needed to save the life of the mother. However, as the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel has reported, he opposes exceptions for rape and incest. The National Right to Life Committee concurs, based on information the group collected in 1998 and 2000 from Ryan as a candidate. The anti-abortion group gives Ryan a 100 percent rating. Ryan now says he will follow Romney’s policy. But the current Obama ad does away with the "all" and so its claim for Ryan stands on solid ground. On Romney, the record is murky. To be sure, he has flip-flopped on the issue, earning a Full Flop on PolitiFact's Flip-O-Meter. His current stance, as he prominently posted in the pages of the National Review in 2011, is to outlaw abortion except to save the life of the mother or in cases of rape and incest. He would press to see Roe vs. Wade overturned and allow states to set their own rules on abortion. The charge that he went beyond that view rests on an interview he had with former Arkansas governor, Mike Huckabee, on Fox television. Huckabee asked Romney about a Massachusetts law that helped cover the costs of abortion. Romney said it would take a state constitutional amendment to change that and then Huckabee asked, "Would you have supported a constitutional amendment that would have established the definition of life as conception?" Romney replied, "Absolutely." To Democrats, this was the same as if Romney had said he supported a personhood amendment. A personhood measure was on the ballot in Mississippi and had it passed, the impacts would have been profound. "It would definitely ban abortion," said Glenn Cohen, an assistant professor at Harvard Law. Cohen is co-director of the law school’s Petrie-Flom Center for Health Law, Biotechnology and Bioethics and assessed the Mississippi measure. But it is unclear if Romney was endorsing a personhood amendment because Huckabee never used the word ‘personhood’. Nor did Huckabee mention Mississippi. "Life beginning at conception is a general statement," said Anne Fox, president of Massachusetts Citizens for Life, a group opposed to abortion. "A personhood amendment is a specific piece of legislation." When we contacted the Obama campaign, a spokeswoman cited this interview as evidence that Romney had endorsed a personhood amendment in Massachusetts. But there is little proof that such an amendment ever existed. Neither Fox nor Cohen, two people who closely follow the legal framework for abortion in Massachusetts, have ever seen the text of a personhood amendment in their state. While there is a website to recruit activists to put such a measure on the ballot in Massachusetts, it is registered to a Keith Mason in Colorado. The home page says "The organizers that got personhood on the ballot in Colorado, would like to help in Massachusetts as well." Keith Mason is the president of Personhood USA, an amendment advocacy group. Further, Cohen argues that the legal gap between ‘life begins at conception’ and personhood is large. "Saying "life" begins at fertilization is quite different from saying "personhood" does. No one denies that fetuses or embryos are alive, but many dispute that they are persons in the sense that they have legal rights -- at least not to be destroyed without very good reason." Cohen said. Would these legal distinctions matter to every anti-abortion activist? Not necessarily. Throughout the history of this debate, the phrase "life begins at conception" has often been synonymous with banning abortions. Romney’s running mate, Paul Ryan, makes that connection and, as we noted, would make no exception for rape and incest. These lexical associations further muddy the meaning of Romney’s answer to Huckabee. Romney has kept specific personhood measures at arm’s length. He never endorsed the Mississippi ballot measure. Claiming a scheduling conflict, he did not participate in personhood candidate forums in Iowa, South Carolina and Florida sponsored by Personhood USA. Romney’s relations with Personhood USA have been rocky. The group accused him of "throwing a pro-life congressman under the bus" when Missouri Republican Senate candidate Todd Akin made controversial comments about rape victims and Romney said Akin should withdraw from the race. Romney refused to sign the Personhood USA pledge that mirrors the Mississippi measure. On some occasions, however, the group has spoken well of Romney. Our ruling Barack Obama said in a television ad that Romney and Ryan Romney "both backed proposals that would outlaw abortions even in cases of rape or incest." That is true for Ryan. His opposition to abortion, including in cases of rape and incest, is clear. Romney chose Ryan as his running mate and now Ryan says he’ll follow Romney’s lead. Romney has said he supports an amendment that defines life as beginning at conception. When he said that, there was no specific amendment language for him to consider. The term "life begins at conception" is strongly associated with banning abortion, and in some advocates’ view, without exception for rape and incest. But Romney has distanced himself from formal personhood amendments and he made clear in National Review that he supports exceptions for rape or incest. Still, his words and his choice of Ryan tend to blur the distinctions that he himself would emphasize. We rate the statement Half True.

pomt-14424	When Honduran children came into this country, "Secretary Clinton said send them back."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/mar/09/bernie-sanders/sanders-said-clinton-backed-return-undocumented-ki/	At the Democratic presidential debate at Miami Dade College, Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders aimed to show that he, not former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, is the better friend of undocumented immigrants. Sanders said that in Vermont, he backed state driver’s licenses for undocumented immigrants. In New York, he said, Clinton opposed it. Sanders recalled the period in 2014 when tens of thousands of unaccompanied minors surged across the border. "One of the great human tragedies of recent years is children came from Honduras where there's more violence than in any place in this country, and they came into this country," Sanders said. "And I said welcome these children into this country. Secretary Clinton said, send them back." Clinton said that wasn’t a fair summary. The Sanders campaign said they got their information from an interview Clinton gave to CNN’s Christiane Amanpour in June 2014. We looked at the full exchange about what the United States should do with the children. Amanpour: "Should they be able to stay here? It's safer." Clinton: "Well -- it may be safer but that's not the answer. I do not -- " Amanpour: "Should they be sent back?" Clinton: "Well, first of all, we have to provide the best emergency care we can provide. We have children 5 and 6 years old who have come up from Central America. We need to do more to provide border security in southern Mexico." Amanpour: "So, you're saying they should be sent back now?" Clinton: "Well, they should be sent back as soon as it can be determined who responsible adults in their families are, because there are concerns whether all of them should be sent back. But I think all of them who can be should be reunited with their families." Clinton made a couple of points in that last answer. It is not as simple as saying "send them back," but that was certainly an outcome she supported in some cases. To be precise, she said they should be sent back if the government can identify responsible adults to care for them. She allowed that it might not be possible to send all of them to their home country. But she indicated a preference. "I think all of them who can be should be reunited with their families," Clinton said. It should be noted that at the time, the administration actively pursued a policy to dissuade children and teenagers in Central America from attempting the trip in the first place. The government had open letters printed in local newspapers and paid for advertizing that dispelled any myth that these young people would be allowed to stay if they could get across the border. In July 2014, the White House signaled that it would seek funds to expedite the return of most of the children stopped at the American border. We sought comment from the Clinton campaign and had not heard back by the time we published. Our ruling Sanders said that when undocumented children were streaming across the border, Clinton said, send them back. That is a bit of an oversimplification. Clinton did not say they should be sent back no matter what. She set the condition that the government should first identify responsible adults to care for them. However, she expressed a preference that as many as possible be sent back. That message was part of the administration’s policy to discourage more young people from attempting the trip.

pomt-00364	Says John Cox "parroted, parroted Trump — almost verbatim — on the children’s separation issues at the border."	mostly false	/california/statements/2018/sep/12/gavin-newsom/gavin-newsoms-misleading-claim-john-cox-parroting-/	In his run for California governor, Democratic Lt. Gov. Gavin Newsom has repeatedly tried to tie his Republican opponent John Cox to President Trump’s most hardline immigration policies. Newsom did just that in a recent TV interview. He claimed Cox, a San Diego businessman who Trump has endorsed, has "parroted" Trump on the president’s controversial family separation policy for those who illegally cross the border. Newsom made the assertion immediately after discussing Cox’s policies, implying that his Republican rival fully supports separating immigrant families. "Even by relatively moderate positions in the Republican party in California, he’s on the extreme of those positions," Newsom told ABC7 in Los Angeles on Aug. 17, 2018. "He can’t run away from Trump. He parroted, parroted Trump—almost verbatim—on the children’s separation issues at the border." Newsom makes his claim in the ABC7 TV interview above. We fact-checked the last portion of Newsom’s statement. Our research It’s not clear which specific words Newsom believes Cox has "parroted." That’s because Trump has made many claims about the child separation policy, some of which blame Democrats in Congress for forcing the crisis. Thousands of children were taken from their parents and sent to detention centers this spring after their families crossed the border. Though Trump eventually ended the policy, hundreds of children remain separated. Trump has also claimed the problem could be solved if people "Don't come to our country illegally. Come like other people do. Come legally." Still, the implication in Newsom’s statement is straigtforward: That Cox and Trump share the same words and viewpoints on the policy. Cox says he's opposed There’s one big problem: Cox clearly stated his opposition to separating families at a June press conference at the state Capitol. The conference and proceeding rally was organized in support of repealing the state’s gas tax increase, one of Cox’s top causes. "I'm against separating parents and children, I'm a father. I have four daughters. That's a congressional problem," Cox told reporters. "I hope we get a congressional solution very soon. He later added: "I’m about solutions. … I hope Congress solves that problem, as well, and I’ll work with it." Asked the same month on KGO Radio about the policy, Cox said: "I would certainly add my voice to try and keep parents and children together." Cox was again asked whether he supports separating children from families in an August TV interview on Bloomberg Politics. He did not offer an explicit answer, but said: "I support getting a solution." None of the responses show Cox favors the policy. To support Newsom’s claim, his spokesman Nathan Click pointed to a June Sacramento Bee article that covered Cox’s comments at the June press conference. The article begins this way: Republican gubernatorial candidate John Cox on Monday backed President Donald Trump's stance on separating immigrant parents from their children at the border, saying, "that's a congressional problem." Cox is quoted later in the article saying he’s "against" separating families. In an email, Cox’s spokesman Matt Shupe wrote that Newsom’s statement is "100 percent FALSE." Who’s to blame? Setting aside the key context that Cox has opposed the policy, we examined whether Cox’s words in any other way "parrot" Trump’s, as Newsom stated. We found Cox and Trump both say that Congress must solve family separations. But even on this point, there’s a degree of difference. Trump has focused his blame mostly on Democrats in Congress, while Cox hasn’t been that specific. On May 26, Trump tweeted: Then, on June 16, Trump tweeted: PolitiFact and other news organizations have debunked Trump’s false claim that Democrats or others in Congress passed a law that forced the family separations. They have noted the Trump administration is responsible for its own policy. "There is no such law," PolitiFact National wrote in a recent fact check. "The Homeland Security Department’s longstanding policy is to separate children from their custodians when they are referred for criminal prosecution. Trump’s administration has decided to prosecute all illegal crossings. Families were rarely prosecuted under previous administrations." Our ruling Democrat Gavin Newsom recently claimed his GOP opponent for governor John Cox "parroted" President Trump on the issue of family separations at the border. His statement, made right after a discussion of Cox’s policies, wrongly implies Cox supports separating immigrant families. Cox has repeatedly stated he opposes the policy. Cox and Trump have both said Congress should solve the issue, offering one parallel between the two. But even on this point, they’re not in lock-step. Trump has falsely blamed Democrats in Congress for forcing the separations, while Cox hasn’t made that specific charge. If anything, Cox has "parroted" one of Trump’s talking points about who should solve the problem. But he hasn’t backed Trump’s policy. Newsom’s statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression. We rate it Mostly False. MOSTLY FALSE – The statement contains some element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression.

pomt-00346	Says Andrew Gillum "wants to increase Florida taxes by a billion dollars."	mostly true	/florida/statements/2018/sep/14/republican-governors-association/republican-ad-correct-andrew-gillum-wants-raise-fl/	A TV attack ad portrays Florida Democrat Andrew Gillum as so "far out" that he is on another planet. "Gillum wants to increase Florida taxes by a billion dollars. Disaster for the economy," says an ad by the Republican Governors Association showing Gillum’s headshot floating in space. The 30-second ad also attacks Gillum over his support for Medicare for All and abolishing the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement. But here, we’ll focus on whether Gillum wants to raise Florida taxes by $1 billion. He does, though the ad doesn’t make clear what taxes Gillum wants to raise, who would pay, and how Florida would spend the additional revenue. Gillum’s tax plan Gillum has proposed increasing Florida’s corporate tax rate from 5.5 percent to 7.75 percent to generate an additional $1 billion a year. His opponent, Republican Ron DeSantis, has signed a pledge not to raise taxes. Gillum said he would put that extra revenue toward education, including a minimum teacher salary of $50,000 and raising pay for veteran teachers to the national average. Gillum also plans to invest in early childhood education programs and vocational training. The state corporate tax currently generates about $2.5 billion a year. Most businesses, however, are exempt from paying any tax because the state exempts the first $50,000 in taxable income. Gillum’s campaign said he would keep that exemption to protect small businesses, but said he wants to close loopholes that allow other corporations to avoid paying taxes. Who ends up paying for corporate taxes Put simply, Gillum’s plan is to have Florida’s biggest corporations pay $1 billion more a year in taxes. That could affect average Floridians, experts told us. But it is difficult to put a dollar figure on it. Kurt Wenner, vice president of research at Florida TaxWatch, said that if a business is forced to pay more in taxes, it can raise prices, reduce employment, reduce costs or investment, or reduce profits. "Those outcomes would all potentially have negative impacts on residents," Wenner said. "The magnitude of those impacts would be hard to quantify, especially factoring in any economic increase from increase government spending." There’s also no way to guarantee that the full $1 billion would flow into the state’s revenues. Corporations could take legal tax planning measures to reduce their liability. That could make funding Gillum’s education priorities more challenging. At the same time, an increase in the tax rate could have negative impacts on corporations’ decisions about where to locate and whether to expand. Richard Auxier, research associate at the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center, said the cost of corporate taxes is shared among stockholders and, unintuitively, among a broader group of workers and investors. The Tax Policy Center assumes 80 percent of the burden is borne by investment returns (dividends, interest, capital gains, etc.), with the remaining 20 percent weighing on wages and other labor income. "Would average Floridians pay some of a corporate tax hike (in the form of lower wages and/or higher prices)? Yes. Would they pay a lot? Nope," Auxier told PolitiFact. "Would investors and managers (who are not all in Florida because multi-state companies pay the tax, too) pay a lot? Yup." Randall G. Holcombe, a Florida State University economics professor, said that a higher tax would discourage business. "Floridians who do not directly pay corporate income tax will still bear a cost of slower economic growth in Florida," he said. "They may also pay higher prices if corporations are able to pass through that tax increase to customers, but the big cost will be slower economic growth." Our ruling The Republican Governors Association said that "Gillum wants to increase Florida taxes by a billion dollars." The ad leaves out the details that voters might want to know about Gillum’s proposal. Gillum proposes raising the corporate tax rate from 5.5 to 7.75 percent, generating about an extra $1 billion from Florida’s biggest corporations to put toward education. The tax wouldn’t directly target the average Floridian, but experts say at least some of the cost could trickle down. The claim is accurate but needs additional information. We rate it Mostly True.

pomt-10598	Hillary Clinton wants to "wave the white flag of surrender and set a date for withdrawal."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/jan/25/john-mccain/a-white-flag-has-a-literal-meaning-too/	John McCain has attacked Hillary Clinton, saying she wants to "wave the white flag of surrender" in Iraq. He said it again in response to a question about Iraq at the Jan. 24, 2008, Republican debate in Boca Raton. (His comments come near the end of the YouTube video, at 9:45.) It's hard to believe Hillary Clinton would say something so impolitic. Did she? It's a harsh paraphrase of what she actually said in the Jan. 21, 2008, Democratic debate in Myrtle Beach, S.C. Here's the full exchange: Question: "Last week, you said the next president will, quote, 'have a war to end in Iraq.' In light of the new military and political progress on the ground there in Iraq, are you looking to end this war or win it?" Clinton: "I'm looking to bring our troops home, starting within 60 days of my becoming president, and here's why, Joe. I have the greatest admiration for the American military. I serve on the Senate Armed Services Committee. I've been to Iraq three times. I've met with the leaders of the various factions. But there is no military solution, and our young men and women should not remain as the referees of their conflict. "I believe what you're seeing happen is twofold. Of course the surge, the so-called surge, was able to pacify certain parts of Iraq. If we put enough of our men and women and equipment in, we're going to be able to have some tactical military success. But the whole purpose of the surge was to force the Iraqi government to move quickly towards the kind of resolution that only it can bring about. "I think what is motivating the Iraqi government is the debate in the political campaign here. They know they will no longer have a blank check from George Bush, that I will withdraw troops from Iraq. And I believe that will put even more pressure on the Iraqis to finally make the decisions that they have to make." McCain is right that Clinton is setting a time frame to start withdrawing troops, and that does imply giving up and waving a metaphorical white flag. Saying there is no military solution as she does could be seen as a form of surrender. But technically, there is no ruling army to surrender to, which is really what a white flag means. Clinton just wants the troops to come home. So McCain is right when he says Clinton is advocating withdrawal from Iraq. But he uses a highly charged term that somewhat overstates the conditions to which she's referring to end U.S. involvement in Iraq. For this reason, we rate his attack Half True.

pomt-04365	Says U.S. Rep. Charles Bass wants to privatize Social Security.	mostly false	/new-hampshire/statements/2012/oct/22/ann-mclane-kuster/ann-mclane-kuster-accused-charlie-bass-wanting-pri/	From the day she officially entered the race, Congressional candidate Ann McLane Kuster has accused her opponent, U.S. Rep. Charles Bass of wanting to privatize Social Security. But, in a recent TV ad, she let a supporter do her talking for her. "I think Congressman Bass’ idea to privatize Social Security is a devastating idea," one voter, Janice Kelble, of Franklin, N.H., says in the ad, "Janice," which first aired on Sept. 6 on New Hampshire airwaves. "Bass just wants to risk Social Security on the stock market," Kelble suggests. "Charlie Bass just plain does not understand the middle class.’ PolitiFact has heard these claims before. The attack has been a rallying cry of sorts for Democrats since George W. Bush was in office, and candidates are pulling the card once again this election season. In fact, we checked the same claim from Kuster this summer, rating it Mostly False. But, with the charge receiving renewed airtime with the ad, we decided to see if anything has changed. Back in June, the Kuster campaign cited a 2001 House vote on then-President Bush’s Commission to Strengthen Social Security as evidence of Bass’ support for privatization. In December 2001, the 16-member commission issued its final report, which urged Congress to incorporate a system of private accounts for personal investment. With strong opposition from Democrats, the commission’s recommendations never reached the floor of Congress. But, the House did consider a number of resolutions and amendments at the time, including H.AMDT.245, a Democratic-sponsored amendment that would have prohibited any funding of the commission’s recommendations. Bass joined each of his Republican colleagues at the time in voting against the amendment, which failed 188-238. But, analysts determined both then and now that the vote was more of a pre-emptive strike than a true endorsement of privatization. "He may have (supported privatization)," Michael Tanner, a senior fellow at the conservative Cato Institute, said back in June. "Republicans generally did at that point, but this vote was certainly not a vote that could be read that way." In both the current ad and in past claims, Kuster cites a 2005 news article as further evidence of Bass’ support for privatization. In this story, printed in the Eagle Times of Claremont, N.H., Bass offered support for then-President Bush’s plan to introduce a private accounts option for Social Security beneficiaries. "I support the establishment of private savings accounts because it allows low- and middle-income workers the chance to get ahead," Bass said, according to the Eagle Times. As noted in the prior ruling, Bass further clarified his stance that year with a statement issued the night Bush outlined his plan in his State of the Union address. "I am an advocate of the President's call for Social Security reform and will work with him in the next two years to save and protect this important program," Bass wrote at the time, according to the National Journal and Project Vote Smart. Some analysts argue that Bush’s plan, to allow workers under 55 the option of directing up to 4 percent of their payroll taxes into private accounts, is as close to privatization as the debate has reached in recent years. "Virtually no one has proposed replacing all of Social Security with private accounts, Paul Van de Water, a seniors fellow at the left-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, said in the initial Kuster piece. "Given the way the debate has evolved, being for … privatization doesn’t mean you’re for privatizing the whole darn thing." But, PolitiFact has determined in past rulings that the private accounts option does not meet the standards of full privatization. First, it would be fully optional, and secondly, beneficiaries could opt to place only a portion of their payroll taxes into private accounts, qualifying as a partial privatization plan at best. "To address this financial crisis facing the Social Security program, one such idea Congressman Bass has supported would create a program that would allow individuals to voluntarily place a portion of their money that they currently pay as part of the payroll tax and place it into a personal account," Bass spokesman Scott Tranchemontagne wrote in a June email to the Telegraph. "Saying that (Bass) supports ‘privatizing Social Security is pure political rhetoric devised by Democratic spin doctors to frighten seniors." Our ruling: Little if anything has changed since our past ruling on Kuster’s claims about Bass’ support for privatization. The statements and votes that the Democrat references in support of her claim suggest Bass supported a move toward partial privatization, not full privatization as the claim suggests. Kuster’s claim was Mostly Falsethen, and it continues to be now.	None	Ann McLane Kuster	None	None	None	2012-10-22T12:00:00	2012-09-06	['United_States']
pomt-07666	"Our average private sector employee pays 23 percent for their health care. Our average city worker in Ohio pays 9 percent."	true	/ohio/statements/2011/mar/10/john-kasich/gov-john-kasich-cites-disparity-between-what-priva/	Republicans in Ohio have offered a variety of arguments to justify their controversial effort to overhaul the state’s collective bargaining law, which for nearly 30 years has set the ground rules for public workers and their employers to reach labor agreements. A new collective bargaining law, known as Senate Bill 5, is making is way through the state legislature with strong support from Republican Gov. John Kasich. The bill would scale back public workers’ rights at the bargaining table and has prompted unions to fight back with protests and promises to get even in the voting booth. Kasich and Republicans say the current rules have resulted in costly labor pacts that cities and other local governments can no longer afford. As an example, Kasich pointed out the relatively low price public workers pay towards their employer-supported health care plans in a recent interview with Fox News. "Our average private sector employee pays 23 percent for their health care," Kasich said. "Our average city worker in Ohio pays 9 percent." Because that’s a pretty wide disparity, PolitiFact Ohio decided to check the governor’s numbers. We started with Kasich’s claim that private sector workers contribute 23 percent of their health care premiums. Kasich spokesman Rob Nichols pointed us to a report from The Buckeye Institute for Public Policy Solutions, a conservative think tank, titled "The Grand Bargain is Dead." That study compared compensation paid to state workers and private sector employees and concluded that state workers’ pay is out of balance. The state could cut into its projected $8 billion budget deficit if it could find ways to reduce their pay and benefits, the study noted. One suggestion it made: force government workers to pay the same health care premiums, out-of-pocket costs for carrying health insurance, as private sector workers. "State government workers today pay roughly 17 percent of the premium costs for the health care coverage. The premium costs for private-sector workers in Ohio is 23 percent," the report said. More specifically, the report figures the average cost of family health insurance policies provided by Ohio firms is $11,425, with the employee paying $2,642. The report cites a January 2010 e-mail with a U.S. Department of Labor economist as evidence for its claim. We contacted the economist, Miranda Moore, and she pointed us to the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey, which has polled nearly 470,000 private firms in Ohio in 2008 and 2009 combined. The numbers in the Buckeye Institute’s report were contained in the 2008 survey. The 2009 survey showed private sector workers in Ohio paid 31 percent of their premiums for a family policy. Moore said in an e-mail to us that the survey is a source the Employee Benefits Security Administration references often. As for the premium percentage that city workers pay for health care, Kasich relied on a State Employment Relations Board report, Nichols said. The 2010 Report on the Cost of Health Insurance in Ohio’s Public Sector aims to provide data that can be used during labor negotiations. SERB surveyed every public employer in Ohio, including the state, cities, counties, school districts and state universities, about the costs of their medical premiums. Of 1,359 surveys sent out, SERB received 1,080 back, including nearly three quarters of the cities -- 184 out of 248. SERB concluded that city workers in Ohio pay 8.1 percent of their health care coverage for single coverage and 8.3 percent for family coverage. Most of the plans include coverage for prescription drugs, but plans for dental and vision coverage typically are not included, the report said. Kasich spokesman Scott Milburn said the governor used 9 percent instead of 8 percent to be on the safe side. Kasich relied on government surveys for both parts of his statement, and the averages cited in those surveys match the numbers in his claim. We rate the statement True.

pomt-00659	Proposed fast-track legislation allows presidents to "easily use a future trade deal to override our domestic financial rules."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/may/14/elizabeth-warren/fact-checking-elizabeth-warren-and-barack-obama-tr/	President Barack Obama’s international trade agenda is moving forward in Congress, after facing temporary defeat by fellow Democrats in the Senate. Obama is butting heads with many Democrats over this issue, but his squabble with Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., has been the most public. Most recently, Warren said if Obama gets his way on trade, it could unravel Dodd-Frank -- Obama’s hallmark financial regulations enacted after the 2008 financial crisis. "In the next few weeks, Congress will decide whether to give the president fast-track authority," Warren said in May 5 remarks at the liberal Institute for New Economic Thinking. "This is a long-term problem — a six-year problem. If fast-track passes, a Republican president could easily use a future trade deal to override our domestic financial rules." Obama responded to that claim in a May 8 interview with Yahoo’s Matt Bai. "She’s absolutely wrong," he said. "Think about the logic of that, right? The notion that I had this massive fight with Wall Street to make sure that we don’t repeat what happened in 2007, 2008. And then I sign a provision that would unravel it? I’d have to be pretty stupid." So who’s right here? We decided to dig into the substance of their arguments and see if Dodd-Frank really is in danger because of the trade debate. Buckle up. Alphabet soup A lot of media coverage has conflated two distinct aspects of the trade debate. The first is the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP), which is the trade deal that Obama is currently negotiating with several countries along the Pacific. The second is Trade Promotion Authority (TPA), which is a piece of legislation that would allow trade agreements (such as the TPP) to move through Congress under special rules intended to speed up the process, thus its nickname "fast-track." Most trade deals since the 1970s have been accompanied by fast-track legislation. If the fast-track rules pass, Congress would not be able to amend or filibuster a trade agreement, which means the deal would only need 51 votes in the Senate to pass, as opposed to the 60 votes necessary without fast-track. And the rules would apply to all trade agreements before Congress for the next six years. Supporters say fast-track is necessary to bolster confidence among foreign partners that domestic politics won’t dismantle a trade agreement. Critics, like Warren, argue that this drastically diminishes Congress’ role in the process, to its detriment. It’s the fast-track bill that Warren said could allow future politicians to "easily" chip away at Dodd-Frank or any other law. This is possible in theory. Here’s how. Imagine that the next president does not support Dodd-Frank regulations. He or she could -- unlike the Obama administration -- be open to discussing Dodd-Frank as part of foreign trade negotiations. The president could bring to Congress a trade agreement that requires scaling back Dodd-Frank to comply with the agreement parameters. (Congress doesn’t vote on the agreement itself, it votes on a bill that lays out how the agreement will be implemented under U.S. law.) The administration could try to push this through without fast-track, but it would likely face opposition from members of Congress like Warren, who could try to amend or filibuster the agreement in order to maintain Dodd-Frank as is. With fast-track, the agreement wouldn’t face these hurdles. Congress’ only option would be to vote against the whole agreement -- all or nothing. If enough Dodd-Frank supporters were to decide that the trade deal is more important, the agreement could pass, watered-down regulations and all. So Warren’s prediction is possible -- not "absolutely wrong," as Obama said. However, as Obama also said, "this is pure speculation." How big of a risk exists is a much harder question to answer. Is it easy? Those who share Warren’s position argue that under fast-track, a trade deal only needs 51 Senate votes, as opposed to 60 without fast-track, and that makes a huge difference in how easy it is to move the deal through Congress. It could be a "backdoor means of undermining Wall Street reform," said Ben Beachy, global trade research director at Public Citizen, an advocacy group that sides with Warren on this issue. Beachy noted that the Trans-Pacific Partnership might hurt Dodd-Frank, because it includes certain financial parameters that mirror many of the North American Free Trade Agreement’s "pre-crisis, deregulatory rules that threaten financial regulations" and would expand them further. However, what’s actually in the Trans-Pacific Partnership remains secret, and the White House denies this claim. Even accounting for the Senate vote threshold, though, nearly every expert we interviewed said Warren exaggerated the threat that fast-track authority would "easily" allow a Republican president to dissolve Dodd-Frank. "The risks are very small, so in that sense I agree with Obama," said Bill Krist, senior policy scholar at the Wilson Center and a former trade official in the early 1980s. "But in the more literal sense of Elizabeth Warren being ‘absolutely wrong,’ I don’t." First of all, the fast-track bill currently on the table gives members of Congress other ways to object to the negotiations, said Gary Hufbauer, senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics and a trade official at the Treasury in the late 1970s. It allows a bipartisan group of Congress to advise and serve as delegates. Relatedly, the fast-track bill gives Congress the ability to reject fast-track for a particular trade deal if it fails to meet certain congressional objectives. Additionally, trade negotiations take a long time, so it’s hard to envision a new president coming in, reversing the U.S. position on financial regulation, and finalizing a deal by 2021 (the end of the fast-track bill’s time frame). For example, the Trans-Pacific Partnership, nearing completion this year, has been in the works since 2005. "The proposition that suddenly a trade deal is going to appear and it’s inconsistent with Dodd-Frank is not going to work," said Brookings Institution fellow and international trade expert Joshua Metzler, adding that the parameters of a trade deal "are seen from miles away." It’s also important to keep in mind that future administrations could go after Dodd-Frank through the courts, by passing domestic legislation, or through regulatory discretion -- all of which would be more much more efficient than going through international negotiations, Hufbauer said. "It’s always possible that a future administration will do things in the financial area that she doesn’t like," he said. Warren argues changing regulation through trade agreements is "hardly a hypothetical possibility" -- there’s evidence of big banks on both sides of the Atlantic trying to push through Dodd-Frank reductions through a trade deal with the European Union currently in progress. U.S. officials, such as Trade Representative Mike Froman and Treasury Secretary Jack Lew, have acknowledged the pressure coming from banks to consider changing financial regulations as part of the negotiating process. They have, however, staunchly avoided such discussions. Of course, as Warren said in her May 5 remarks, this attitude might not carry into the next administration. But even if a new administration thinks trade negotiations are the appropriate avenue for dismissing financial regulations, it might not be so simple to get all parties to agree. Some regulations in Europe in particular -- such as those affecting credit rating agencies, insurance companies and banker bonuses -- "are more stringent than those adopted by the United States in the financial crisis," said Chris Brummer, senior fellow at the Atlantic Council and Georgetown University law professor. One final issue We wanted to briefly address the issue of investor-state dispute settlements (ISDS), a form of international arbitrage in which an investor can bring a claim against a foreign government. It’s not 100 percent germane to the topic at hand, but it’s been getting mixed up in the discussions about the Obama-Warren trade dispute. As it stands, the Trans-Pacific Partnership will have this type of settlement system. Warren and others oppose the settlements for a number of reasons: the proceedings are secretive, and the court can impose a fine on the foreign government so large that it changes its domestic laws as a result. The classic example of an ISDS case is tobacco giant Philip-Morris suing nations over their domestic anti-smoking laws, claiming the laws damage their profits. But Warren’s staff told us that her beliefs about ISDS are separate from her position on fast-track -- she didn’t mention ISDS in her May 5 remarks, when she said the fast-track bill could derail Dodd-Frank, nor when she made the same point on PBS Newshour May 13. (She has mentioned it in the past.) Obama appears to have misinterpreted Warren’s most recent comments. In responding to them in the Yahoo interview, he said her argument "is based on this dispute-settlement provision I just talked about. There’s no evidence that this could ever be used in this way." That’s basically true, said Brummer, of Georgetown Law. "Virtually all trade agreements include regulatory carve-outs that limit the jurisdiction of the courts as relating to market supervision," he said, so it's highly unlikely that the Trans-Pacific Partnership or a deal with the European Union would cede authority to special arbitrators to unwind hard-fought financial reforms. "At most, one would see a process elaborated for enhanced cross-border regulatory cooperation, something you already see in some accords." In any case, in the statement we are fact-checking, Warren was not arguing that ISDS would be cause for Dodd-Frank rollbacks, something we wanted to clarify. Our ruling Warren said proposed fast-track legislation would allow presidents to "easily use a future trade deal to override our domestic financial rules." It’s not entirely far-fetched that a trade deal could impact domestic financial rules -- in fact banks and some countries are pushing to make financial regulation part of ongoing negotiations with the European Union. And fast-track legislation would remove some congressional hurdles. However, that doesn’t mean the process would be easy. Negotiations take many years, and there are other obstacles that could stop watered-down financial regulations from making it into a final deal. Additionally, it is pure speculation that this fast-track bill in particular would result in scaled-back Dodd-Frank rules. We rate Warren’s claim Half True.

pomt-00345	The new Apple Watch Series 4 includes "the first ECG product offered over-the-counter directly to consumers."	false	/california/statements/2018/sep/14/jeff-williams/apple-beat-claim-about-first-ekg-consumer-product/	During the unveiling of the latest Apple watch in San Francisco this week, the company’s Chief Operating Officer Jeff Williams made a claim that’s been described as "alternative facts" by another Silicon Valley CEO and called into question by recent news reports. Here’s what Williams said about the Apple Watch Series 4’s new built-in electrocardiogram feature, or ECG: "This is the first ECG product offered over-the-counter directly to consumers," he claimed at the Apple event on Sept. 12, 2018. Williams makes his claim in the video above. Electrocardiograms, also abbreviated as EKGs, are commonly used at hospitals to check a heart’s electrical activity, to test for poor blood flow or for a heart attack. Apple’s previous watches have included heart monitors for fitness tracking, but not for medical usage. Was Williams off-beat with his claim? We decided to check the facts. At PolitiFact we typically fact-check politicians. But we also investigate claims by media pundits from Rush Limbaugh to Joe Scarborough, along with athletes and celebrities, such as Colin Kaepernick, who wield a lot of political influence. In this case we fact-checked a California-based company that’s very influential with the goal of holding it accountable for what it says, too. Our research A spokesman for Apple declined to respond on-the-record. The company’s Apple Watch Series 4 starts at $399 and includes a model for $499. The product starts shipping later this month, though the electrocardiogram feature won’t be available until sometime later this year, according to news reports. The strongest push back against Williams’ statement comes from Vic Gundotra, CEO of Mountain View-based AliveCor. His company also produces over-the-counter ECG devices and has been doing so for several years. Specifically, it makes an FDA-cleared band for the Apple Watch, called KardiaBand, which sells for $199, as well as a version that attaches to a smartphone, called Kardia. CEO claims Apple used 'alternative facts' "We were watching [the announcement], and we were surprised," Gundotra told Business Insider on Thursday. "It was amazing, it was like us being on stage, with the thing we've been doing for 7 years," referring to AliveCor's product for detecting atrial fibrillation (AFib), a tough-to-spot heart disorder that manifests as an irregular, often quick heart rate that can cause poor circulation. "Although when they said they were first to go over-the-counter, we were surprised," Gundotra continued. "Apple doesn't like to admit they copy anyone, even in the smallest things. Their own version of alternative facts." When we asked AliveCor about the issue, a spokesman provided a toned-down statement from Gundotra: "Apple’s advances in cardiac monitoring validate the need for this mobile ECG technology -- a path which AliveCor paved with our Kardia products," the statement said. "These still stand as the first and most clinically validated over-the-counter FDA-cleared consumer ECG devices." Apple unveiled its new Apple Watch Series 4 in San Francisco this week. Associated Press file photo. Statement falls short? In addition to Gundotra’s comments, a New York Times report called out Williams’ claim. So did an article at TechCrunch.com: "While Apple loves to be first to things, that statement is false. AliveCor has held the title of first since 2014 for its KardiaMobile device, a $100 stick-like metal unit you attach to the back of a smartphone." The article links to a 2014 AliveCor press release announcing it had received federal over-the-counter clearance for the AliveCor Heart Monitor, a single-channel ECG recorder. Subtle difference? A CNBC article presents what it calls a subtle difference between AliveCor and Apple’s new product: It says: "Once a consumer buys an AliveCor device, they take an EKG reading (via a smartphone attachment or their Apple Watch band), and wait until a doctor unlocks it within 24 hours to get an initial reading on the app. Apple designed its system differently. The FDA cleared the company to provide these readings to consumers right away, allowing users to share the results with a physician if they choose." Turning back to AliveCor, the company’s website says a physician’s reading is necessary only for the first test of its product. "Due to regulatory necessity, new U.S. accounts are required to have their first EKG reviewed by a U.S. board-certified cardiologist free of charge (a $19 value within the app). You will be blocked for up to 24 hours from EKG features until the review is complete (although it is often much faster)." Our ruling Apple Chief Operating Officer Jeff Williams said the new Apple Watch Series 4 "is the first ECG product offered over-the-counter directly to consumers." That claim ignores the fact that start-up AliveCor has produced over-the-counter ECG devices for several years. The AliveCor device requires a cardiologist to review the first test, while that won’t be necessary for the Apple watch. This is a very subtle distinction and not enough to stand up Williams’ claim. We rate it False. FALSE – The statement is not accurate. Click here for more on the six PolitiFact ratings and how we select facts to check.

pomt-14403	"One would have to go back more than a century to find a scenario where a president’s nominee for the Supreme Court was confirmed by the opposition party in the Senate when the vacancy occurred during an election year."	true	/arizona/statements/2016/mar/14/jeff-flake/arizona-senator-claims-confirming-supreme-court-no/	As President Barack Obama is on the brink of selecting a U.S. Supreme Court nominee to replace the late Justice Antonin Scalia, Republican lawmakers have made a slew of historical statements related to vacant Supreme Court seats. Sen. Jeff Flake, R-Ariz., joined the party in a Feb. 22 statement. "One would have to go back more than a century to find a scenario where a president’s nominee for the Supreme Court was confirmed by the opposition party in the Senate when the vacancy occurred during an election year," Flake said. "I'm not about to break new ground in the Senate, particularly when any nominee could so drastically shift the balance of the court." PolitiFact has researched similar claims of late: Texas Sen. Ted Cruz said in February that "it’s been 80 years since a Supreme Court vacancy was nominated and confirmed in an election year," also saying that not approving a nomination in an election year is a long tradition. It’s been 76 years, but these openings are rare, so it’s not much of a tradition. We rated Cruz’s claim Half True. Florida Sen. Marco Rubio also claimed in February that "it’s been 80 years since a lame-duck president appointed a Supreme Court Justice." President Ronald Reagan, in his second term, nominated Justice Anthony Kennedy in November 1987. He confirmed Kennedy while still in office in February 1988. We rated Rubio’s claim Mostly False. So, turning back the history book once again, we decided to look at Flake’s claim. Checks out Flake spokesman Jason Samuels emphasized that the Arizona senator’s statement included "confirmed by the opposition party" and "vacancy occurred during an election year" when we reached out. Samuels referred us to the Senate’s list of Supreme Court nominations going back to 1789. Experts we spoke with generally agreed with Flake’s claim. Sarah Binder, a political scientist at George Washington University, said Flake’s statement is "technically correct." She noted that there are no 20th century examples of a Supreme Court vacancy in an election year that the opposition party in the Senate refused to consider. "The only seat left vacant was Sherman Minton's, who resigned in October 1956, one month before the election. The (Democratic-controlled) Senate had already adjourned for the elections, so (Republican) President Eisenhower gave William Brennan a recess appointment, and he was later nominated and confirmed in 1957," Binder said. A recess appointment isn’t the same as submitting a nominee, according to Russell Wheeler, an expert on federal courts at the Brookings Institution. "Eisenhower didn’t submit a nominee; he recess appointed Brennan then nominated him the following January. It helped that Brennan was a Democrat," Wheeler said. The Justice Kennedy instance aids Flake’s statement too. "Jeff chose his words very, very carefully. There have been vacancies during election years that were filled -- including Anthony Kennedy -- by an opposition Senate. But the vacancy occurred shortly before the election year," said Norman Ornstein, a scholar at the conservative American Enterprise Institute. "Fundamental to this statement is the reality that we have not had a vacancy occurring in an election year with an opposition Senate." Our ruling Flake said, "One would have to go back more than a century to find a scenario where a president’s nominee for the Supreme Court was confirmed by the opposition party in the Senate when the vacancy occurred during an election year." He’s right. Flake’s carefully crafted statement rules out potential exceptions, such as Justice Kennedy’s 1988 election year confirmation, but 1987 nomination, or the 1950s case with President Eisenhower and a Democratic Senate in adjournment when a Supreme Court vacancy came up a month before the November election. This seems to be because a vacancy just hasn’t happened to occur under these circumstances. We rate Flake’s claim as True.	None	Jeff Flake	None	None	None	2016-03-14T14:55:01	2016-02-22	['None']
pomt-04034	Says "the area damaged by Hurricane Sandy represents roughly 10 percent of our nation's economy."	mostly true	/new-jersey/statements/2013/jan/31/rodney-frelinghuysen/hurricane-sandy-damaged-area-representing-about-10/	Calling on House members this month to approve federal aid for victims of Hurricane Sandy, Rep. Rodney Frelinghuysen offered his colleagues a national lens to view the destruction: the damaged area accounts for about 10 percent of the nation’s economy. The Republican congressman made that point during a Jan. 15 debate that ended with the GOP-controlled House signing off on roughly $50 billion in emergency aid for Sandy victims. The bulk of that funding was based on an amendment sponsored by Frelinghuysen to provide about $33 billion in additional aid. In his speech on the House floor, the congressman argued that providing the disaster relief made economic sense. "Mister Chairman, the area damaged by Hurricane Sandy represents roughly 10 percent of our nation's economy," said Frelinghuysen (R-11th Dist.). "It makes good sense, economic and fiscal, to get our region back on its feet as soon as it can." Steve Wilson, a senior policy adviser to Frelinghuysen, told us the statement was in reference to the combined gross domestic product, or GDP, in New York, New Jersey and Connecticut. We found that the combined GDP in those three states was about $1.875 trillion in 2011, marking about 12.5 percent of the national GDP, according to figures from the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis. The 2011 figures represent the most recent data available. But that roughly 12.5 percent figure doesn’t fully support Frelinghuysen’s statement. The congressman referred to "the area damaged by Hurricane Sandy," but the combined GDP applies to the entirety of those three states. In other words, Frelinghuysen’s figure includes parts of those states that were not damaged in the storm, including most of New York. The U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis does not release GDP estimates at the county level, so we can’t measure the combined GDP for the specific counties damaged in the storm. The bureau releases GDP’s by metropolitan statistical area, but they can’t be viewed as a percentage of the national GDP. In response to our findings, Wilson argued in an e-mail that "areas of New Jersey, New York and Connecticut far beyond Sandy’s ‘bullseye’ were deeply affected by the storm." "Two and a half million people in New Jersey alone lost power, many for two weeks, as did large and small businesses, municipal and county governments. A crippling fuel shortage forced the imposition of odd-even gasoline rationing," Wilson said. "New Jersey Transit, which serves tens of tens of thousands of commuters, ground to a halt. As a result, residents of undamaged areas were unable to get to their place of employment." "To ignore these facts is to underestimate Sandy’s devastating effects on residents up and down New Jersey, New York and Connecticut," Wilson added. About three months since Hurricane Sandy made landfall near Atlantic City, the Democrat-led Senate on Monday approved the roughly $50 billion in emergency aid, and President Barack Obama signed the bill on Tuesday. Earlier in January, Obama signed a bill passed by Congress to provide $9.7 billion for the National Flood Insurance Program to assist Sandy victims. Our ruling During a Jan. 15 debate over approving federal aid for Hurricane Sandy victims, Frelinghuysen said on the House floor that "the area damaged by Hurricane Sandy represents roughly 10 percent of our nation's economy." But the congressman’s figure applies to a territory much larger than what was damaged in the storm. The statistic represents the combined gross domestic product in all of New York, New Jersey and Connecticut, and thus includes areas that were untouched by Sandy. We rate the statement Mostly True.

pomt-00504	"The Civil War wasn't about slavery."	pants on fire!	/punditfact/statements/2015/jun/25/gavin-mcinnes/tweet-civil-war-was-about-secession-not-slavery/	The erratic anti-feminist and purposefully politically incorrect Gavin McInnes added his take on the Confederate flag controversy. McInnes, a frequent Fox News guest, tweeted to more than 50,000 followers on June 23, 2015, that the Confederate flag should continue to fly. Why? Because, "The Civil War wasn't about slavery," he wrote. "It was about secession." In a companion tweet, McInnes said anyone, like Northerners, who think the Civil War was about slavery should go to Google. "Look it up," said McInnes, who was born in England and grew up in Canada. So we did. We typed in "causes of the Civil War." The first hit was History.net which told us, "The burning issue that led to the disruption of the union, however, was the debate over the future of slavery. That dispute led to secession, and secession brought about a war in which the Northern and Western states and territories fought to preserve the Union, and the South fought to establish Southern independence as a new confederation of states under its own constitution." The second link on Google was to PBS and its History Detectives series. There we read, "What led to the outbreak of the bloodiest conflict in the history of North America? A common explanation is that the Civil War was fought over the moral issue of slavery. In fact, it was the economics of slavery and political control of that system that was central to the conflict." No. 3 on the Google hit parade was Americanhistoryabout.com. That page offered five main reasons and the first one was "Economic and social differences between the North and the South." And what were those differences? Well, slavery. "With Eli Whitney's invention of the cotton gin in 1793, cotton became very profitable. This machine was able to reduce the time it took to separate seeds from the cotton. However, at the same time the increase in the number of plantations willing to move from other crops to cotton meant the greater need for a large amount of cheap labor, i.e. slaves. Thus, the southern economy became a one crop economy, depending on cotton and therefore on slavery." In fact, most of the causes listed on that page, four out of five, revolved around slavery, including the growth of the abolition movement, the fight over allowing slavery in new states, and the election of Abraham Lincoln, who was seen as anti-slavery. The fourth link on Google was from the Civil War Preservation Trust. The trust wrote "The Civil War was the culmination of a series of confrontations concerning the institution of slavery." Just in case the Internet led us astray, we also reached out to a pair of experts on the history of the Civil War. They, too, said McInnes got it fundamentally wrong. Eric Foner, professor of history at Columbia University, used the words of secessionists themselves as proof of their intentions. "Read South Carolina's Declaration of the causes of secession," Foner said. "It is all about protecting slavery." Indeed, the first sentence refers to slaveholding states, and throughout, the institution of slavery is the pivot point around which all else turns. Historian Stephanie McCurry at the University of Pennsylvania points to Mississippi’s declaration of secession. Sentence two begins, "Our position is thoroughly identified with the institution of slavery." So just to be clear: Slavery led to secession, which led to the Civil War. Our ruling McInnes said that the Civil War wasn’t about slavery. McInnes’ preferred research method, Google, proved him wrong. In the words of the seceding states themselves, the South wanted to secede because it wanted to preserve slavery. That, in turn, started the Civil War. McInnes’ Twitter profile shows a man staring intently with eyes crossed, which captures the accuracy of tweet. We rate this claim Pants on Fire.

pomt-02981	Says "74 percent of small-business people believe that Obamacare is a bad idea."	false	/georgia/statements/2013/oct/21/larry-elder/claim-doesnt-pass-examination/	CNN host Don Lemon and commentator Larry Elder made for some entertaining television recently when they sparred over how small-business owners feel about the health care law. "Seventy-four percent of small-business people believe that Obamacare is a bad idea," Elder, a prominent Los Angeles-based conservative talk show host, said during a segment on CNN. "Larry, that’s not true," Lemon replied. "That’s not true." "What’s not true?" Elder asked. "Many people wanted it to be stronger when it came to single-payer," Lemon said. "It all depends on the way you ask the question." The two men talked over each other for a few seconds before Elder repeated his initial point. "I said 74 percent of the small-business people don’t like Obamacare," Elder said. So, we wondered, do nearly three-quarters of small-business owners dislike the health care law? We wondered whether Elder’s statement is correct because the host debated the accuracy of Elder’s claim. Elder’s executive producer sent us a Washington Examiner article that he used to base his claim. The article’s headline said "74 percent of small businesses will fire workers, cut hours under Obamacare." The article was based on a survey done this past summer by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. The survey was done online, with 1,304 respondents who had an executive-level position in a company with less than 500 employees and annual revenue less than $25 million. About one-third of the respondents were U.S. Chamber of Commerce members. The survey, done by Harris Interactive, was said to be weighted to represent the nation’s small-business population. Most of the survey’s respondents were worried about the health care law’s employer mandate that businesses with 50 or more employees must provide insurance for those workers or face a fine. The Obama administration announced July 2 that it was delaying the mandate until 2015. Still, those who answered the survey were overwhelmingly concerned about the impact of the mandate on their businesses. Twenty-seven percent of them said they would cut hours to reduce the number of full-time employees on their payrolls, 24 percent would reduce hiring and 23 percent plan to replace full-time employees (30 hours per week or more) with part-time workers to avoid the mandate. Combined, that’s 74 percent who said they would find ways to avoid the employer mandate. That’s not exactly the same as saying they believe the entire health care law is a bad idea, as Elder said on CNN. This is not the first time someone has used this report to criticize the health care law. U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., repeatedly claimed "75 percent of small businesses now say they are going to be forced to either fire workers or cut their hours" because of the controversial law. PolitiFact and The Washington Post found some flaws with the survey. First, while the survey was said to have a margin of error of 2.5 percentage points, it was not a random survey and such margins of error apply only to random samples from a population. Second, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce has been highly critical of the health care law and has called for it to be repealed, so an online survey in which one-third of the respondents are members may not have been the most scientific approach. Third, and most disturbing, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce acknowledged that only a small percentage of the businesses surveyed said they would be affected by the employer mandate. "A Chamber spokeswoman, who declined to be identified, acknowledged that only 17 percent of the businesses surveyed said they would be affected by the employer mandate," the Post reported. "Put another way, the poll found that 83 percent of small businesses surveyed said they would not be affected by an employer mandate that the Chamber of Commerce has said is a burden on small businesses. Harris and the Chamber highlighted the answers of only those affected by the employer mandate." PolitiFact rated Rubio’s claim a Pants On Fire! Elder said he was unaware of the criticism of the poll. "I read the methodology, the period of time when the poll was conducted, how it was conducted. Seemed legit," Elder said via email. Elder said he still believes the poll accurately reflects the feelings of small-business owners concerning the health care law. "When collectively 74 percent -- I know this number is in dispute -- say it will negatively affect hiring decisions, it is not a stretch to conclude that they deem the law a ‘bad’ one," Elder said. PolitiFact Georgia looked for additional independent polling of small-business owners concerning the health care law. We found there isn’t much out there. In May, a Gallup poll found 48 percent of respondents believe the law will be bad for business, 9 percent said it would be good for their company and 39 percent said it will have no impact. Gallup conducted telephone interviews with 603 people whose businesses had less than $20 million in annual revenue. A poll by Rasmussen Reports done in October found this breakdown among people who describe themselves as entrepreneurs concerning their impressions of the health care law: Very Unfavorable: 49 percent Somewhat Unfavorable: 6 percent Very Favorable: 16 percent Somewhat Favorable: 27 percent Not Sure: 1 percent We note that the poll does not provide more details about these entrepreneurs, such as whether they are self-employed or how many employees they have. To sum up, Elder claimed "74 percent of small-business people believe that Obamacare is a bad idea." There is no independent polling that supports his argument. The numbers that Elder used to base his claim were in response to a different question. Also, the poll that Elder relied on to make his claim is deeply flawed. Still, Elder believes the combined 74 percent of respondents in the U.S. Chamber of Commerce poll who say the health care law may impact future hiring reflects their feelings about Obamacare. Elder may have a point, but there is no concrete evidence that supports his argument. We rate his claim False.	None	Larry Elder	None	None	None	2013-10-21T06:00:00	2013-10-11	['None']
pomt-14530	Says Marco Rubio "went on Univision, and in Spanish he promised that he would not on the first day in office rescind President Obama's illegal executive action."	half-true	/florida/statements/2016/feb/17/ted-cruz/did-marco-rubio-say-spanish-univision-he-would-not/	Ted Cruz says Marco Rubio is so soft on illegal immigration that he even supports President Barack Obama’s program to allow some young people to remain in the United States. The two senators battling in the Republican presidential primary have fought over immigration policy since Rubio co-authored an immigration bill in 2013 and Cruz voted against it. Cruz’s criticism includes what Rubio has said about Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals -- the program started under Obama in 2012 to give temporary legal status to people who were brought to the United States illegally as children. "He went on Univision, and in Spanish he promised that he would not on the first day in office rescind President Obama's illegal executive action," Cruz told Fox News’ Sean Hannity on Feb. 15. Rubio’s campaign pushed back by retweeting several tweets that accused Cruz of mischaracterizing Rubio’s position. Cruz made a similar attack during the Feb. 13 debate in South Carolina to which Rubio replied: "Well, first of all, I don't know how he knows what I said on Univision because he doesn't speak Spanish." (Cruz told Fox News in 2012 that his Spanish was "lousy.") So was something lost in translation here, or has Rubio sided with Obama on the policy? We decided to check the record on what Rubio said on Univision and elsewhere. Univision interview A spokesman for Cruz pointed to an article on the conservative website Breitbart about Rubio’s April 2015 interview with Jorge Ramos of Univision. Ramos asked Rubio if he was elected president if he would keep DACA, the program launched under Obama. Breitbart wrote that "Rubio won’t reverse it himself if elected president" despite the fact that Rubio said that it would have to ultimately end. "I believe DACA is important," Rubio said, according to the initial English translation Breitbart used. "It can’t be terminated from one moment to the next, because there are already people benefiting from it. But yes, it is going to have to end. It can’t be the permanent policy of the United States, and I don’t think that’s what they’re asking either. I think everyone prefers immigration reform." The next day, Breitbart posted a second article based on the official Univision transcript and included comments by the Rubio campaign: "Well, DACA is going to have to end at some point. I wouldn’t undo it immediately. The reason is that there are already people who have that permission, who are working, who are studying, and I don’t think it would be fair to cancel it suddenly. But I do think it is going to have to end. And, God willing, it’s going to end because immigration reform is going to pass." In either translation, Rubio said DACA can’t be canceled suddenly but couldn’t be permanent policy. In an email interview with PolitiFact Florida, Rubio spokesman Alex Burgos pointed to part of the second Breitbart article that stated Rubio "discussed immigration policy, affirming his longstanding objection" to DACA and a similar program for their parents. Cruz spokesman Brian Phillips pointed to responses by the Rubio campaign and said, "So Marco says it will have to end, but punts it to the legislative process." Burgos told PolitiFact Florida, "On day one of a Rubio administration, DACA will start coming to an end by not allowing new applicants into the program and not allowing existing DACA permit holders to renew." What Rubio has said more recently about DACA Rubio has commented about DACA several other times. He told reporters in February 2015 that "eventually that program has to end. It cannot be the permanent policy of the United States. What I'm not advocating is that we cancel it right now at this moment, because you already have people that have signed up for it. They're working, they're going to school. It would be deeply disruptive." In November 2015, he said it had to end even if Congress did nothing. "DACA is going to end and the ideal way for it to end is that it's replaced by a reform system that creates an alternative," Rubio said while in Manchester, N.H in November. "But if it doesn't, it will end. It cannot be the permanent policy of the United States." One final note about Cruz’s statement: We’re not rating here whether DACA is illegal -- the future of the program is in the hands of the U.S. Supreme Court. The justices are expected to review an expansion of DACA, as well as a similar program for their parents, this year based on a lawsuit initiated by Texas. Our ruling Cruz says that Rubio "went on Univision, and in Spanish he promised that he would not on the first day in office rescind President Obama's illegal executive action." That’s a reference to Rubio’s statement in an April 2015 interview about Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals. Cruz is cherry-picking a portion of Rubio’s interview. Rubio said that he wouldn’t undo the program immediately because it would be disruptive, but he said that it would have to end eventually and could not be permanent policy. Initially, Rubio said that he hoped it would end after an immigration bill passed but then in November said it would end even if Congress fails to act. Cruz has created a misleading impression about Rubio’s statement by omitting his full comments. We rate this claim Half True.

pomt-04328	Says U.S. Senate opponent Tommy Thompson "personally made over $3 million" from a federal contract granted to his healthcare company, but left 9/11 first responders "without the care they were promised."	mostly false	/wisconsin/statements/2012/oct/26/tammy-baldwin/baldwin-says-thompson-got-3-million-mismanaged-fed/	In response to a 9/11 ad against her, Democrat Tammy Baldwin has launched one charging that U.S. Senate rival Tommy Thompson personally profited from a mismanaged federal contract that left Ground Zero first responders without promised care. The Baldwin ad opens by calling Thompson’s ad a "disgrace." "The truth: time and again Tammy Baldwin has supported honoring victims of 9/11," a narrator says. "And Tommy Thompson? He got a government contract to provide healthcare to 9/11 first responders, but Tommy took advantage, leaving them without the care they were promised." It concludes: "Tommy Thompson personally made over $3 million off the deal." Newspaper headlines from the New York Daily News ("Ex-health boss now cashing in on 9/11") and USA Today ("Health company slow to start treating workers") flash on the screen, along with a footnote that points to Thompson’s personal financial disclosures. Do Baldwin’s charges square with what happened? The basics Thompson was President George Bush’s secretary of Health and Human Services at the time of the 9/11 attacks in 2001. As such, he was a point of contact for New York-based members of Congress and 9/11 advocates who began a years-long push to get federal aid for health monitoring and treatment of those who responded first to the attacks. Thompson left the Bush Administration after the first term. By early 2005, he had signed on as a law partner at the Washington, D.C., lobbying firm of Akin Gump Strauss Hauer & Feld, and separately was named president of Logistics Health Inc. The La Crosse-based firm, founded in 1999, provides medical readiness and occupational health services, in part through federal government contracts. One of those was the 2008 contract for 9/11 responder care, which was awarded competitively through a division of the federal agency Thompson used to head. The contract was for $11 million for the first year. Logistics Health continues to run the national portion of what is known as the World Trade Center Health Program. The program helps pay for medical treatment and monitoring of certain conditions experienced by people who worked or volunteered on rescue, recovery, demolition, debris removal, and related services in the aftermath of the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks on the World Trade Center. Another contractor coordinates care for New York-area responders and survivors. Baldwin’s claim Let’s return to the main components of the ad’s claim: "He got a government contract to provide healthcare to 9/11 first responders." The ad’s use of the headline -- "Ex-health boss now cashing in on 9/11" -- insinuates a lot. But neither Baldwin nor anyone else we know of has presented evidence Thompson personally scored the contract or influenced his former agency to get it for Logistics Health. On the other hand, the company did get the contract. And Thompson’s value at the firm was tied in part to his connections. That’s what Logistics CEO Don Weber noted in 2006: "If I were to go in and try to get a meeting with some of the decision makers in these organizations, it would take me a lifetime," Weber told the Journal Sentinel at the time. "Tommy is able to make a phone call -- and then we get in front of people who make decisions. And when we can show them what we're all about, it expedites decisions." So that part of the claim is at least partially accurate. "But Tommy took advantage, leaving them without the care they were promised." We read various media accounts regarding the early months of Logistics Health’s work on the 9/11 contract starting. It took over the work in June 2008 from an association of health clinics. No one disputes that gaps in medical coverage and monitoring took place in those early months. At least two media outlets interviewed clients who reported problems getting coverage for prescription drugs and experiencing delays in hearing from Logistics. "A company run by an ex-Bush administration official and hired by the government to provide medical care to Sept. 11 recovery workers has been slow to take up the job, workers and advocates say," the Associated Press reported on Sept. 8, 2008. A November 16, 2008, Wisconsin State Journal story reported that five months into Logistics Health's one-year federal contract, just a fraction of eligible patients had received the required medical monitoring. The situation had attracted a sharp backlash from New York-area members of Congress who complained about Thompson’s "sweetheart deal" with his old department. Thompson and Weber did not deny the delays, a State Journal follow-up story said. They blamed the problems on the agency that awarded the contract, the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health. A NIOSH spokesman in 2008 offered a partial explanation: A one-month delay occurred after the agency inquired to Logistics Health about an issue on consent forms. The first State Journal story quoted Katherine Kirkland, head of the organization that was turning over the 9/11 work to Thompson’s firm, saying that Logistics officials were uncommunicative or dismissive of issues that came up during the transition. Kirkland also said the federal government didn’t allow enough time for the transition. It’s important to note here that even at the time of the November 2008 story, federal officials were saying the start-up problems had been brought under control and all patients were getting needed treatment. There was skepticism about that at the time from 9/11 victim advocacy groups, but it turned out to be true, or largely true, based on what we hear now from those groups. One example: John Feal, president of the FealGood Foundation, which pushed for federal help for first responders, told us Logistics "wasn’t ready for" the job but "for the most part kept their word" after late 2008 to fix the problems. Feal, who is no fan of Thompson, gives "above thumbs up approval" for Logistics’ work since then. NIOSH spokeswoman Christina Spring told us officials there consider Logistics’ performance very good since the delays of the early months. We went back and interviewed Judy Wolff, a nurse's aide from Holmen, Wisconsin, who has suffered from multiple health problems since volunteering at Ground Zero. Her concerns with delays in getting coverage were featured in the November 2008 State Journal piece. Back then, while waiting for Logistics to act, she was forced over several months to pay for her own drugs for various ailments deemed related to her work at the site. Today, she says her care improved a lot after the negative publicity for the company, but that paperwork hassles still trouble her. As for the "took advantage" part, it is unclear exactly what that means -- took advantage of the patients? The situation? the government? Judging by the sentence structure, the claim is that Thompson mismanaged the situation intentionally to make the firm some extra bucks. We asked Baldwin if she could explain and defend the "took advantage" allegation, and she only cited the complaints about delays in care. This part of the claim exaggerates the severity of a serious situation, leaving out the critical fact that the transition problems were mostly ironed out within six months or less, and that the government itself got some of the blame. "Tommy Thompson personally made over $3 million off the deal." Thompson did make that amount from the sale of Logistics Health in 2011. Thompson, who no longer works for the firm, said the money came from stock options. He also reported making $254,000 in salary from the firm between January 2010 and October 2011. But the ad treats that $3.1 million sum as springing directly from the 9/11 contract and entering Thompson’s pocket. Baldwin did not offer any explanation for this part of the claim when we asked her about it. The contract in question started at $11 million a year and at one point fell to $9 million. That’s real money, but a pretty small chunk of Logistics’ business: in 2008 it received $102 million just in federal contracts, according to data at fedspending.org. So this part of Baldwin’s ad is a big reach. Logistics Health did not return a phone call on the Baldwin ad. Our rating Baldwin says Thompson "personally made over $3 million" off a federal contract granted to his healthcare company, but left 9/11 first responders "without the care they were promised." The ad accurately says his firm got a contract and had problems that delayed care for some first responders. But it ignores the mixed blame for the problems as well as the short-term nature of them, while making a sensational and unsubstantiated claim that Thompson personally pocketed millions from this particular contract. And it suggests Thompson "took advantage" of first responders without any evidence to back it up. Looking at the claim as a whole, we rate it Mostly False.

pomt-03747	Says in Chicago, "we take more guns off the streets than New York or L.A."	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2013/apr/09/rahm-emanuel/mayor-rahm-emanuel-says-chicago-takes-more-guns-st/	New York and Los Angeles beat out Chicago as the nation’s most populous cities. But Chicago has more guns on the streets, Mayor Rahm Emanuel told CNN. That was his answer when CNN host Jake Tapper asked on April 2, 2013: With some of the nation’s strictest gun laws, why are your homicide rates still so high? Without uniform gun policies — say, in neighboring Indiana and Wisconsin — weapons still flow, Emanuel said. "We take more guns off the streets than New York or L.A.," he said. Emanuel, who formerly was President Barack Obama's White House chief of staff, is part of a group of mayors that’s fighting for stricter national gun laws. We were curious: Does America’s No. 3 most populous city take No. 1 in gun seizures? Chicago’s guns We talked with Bill McCaffrey, a spokesman in Emanuel’s office. He said the city uses the comparison with New York and Los Angeles to demonstrate that Chicago’s strict gun control rules won’t work by themselves. (Opponents of gun control measures argue the city offers evidence that such laws don’t work, period.) New York and California both have stricter gun control laws than Illinois. Guns cross into Chicago not just from Indiana and Wisconsin, but from areas right outside the city. "Chicago is not an island," McCaffrey said. In the first six months of last year, the city — not counting gun buybacks or turn-ins — seized 3,912 guns. That’s as many as New York and Los Angeles combined, according to the University of Chicago Crime Lab, which got numbers from the cities’ police departments. In Chicago, police picked up illegal weapons at crime scenes and traffic stops, found them with search warrants and investigations, or heard about them when people called 911 to report a "man with a gun" or "shots fired." In the same months that Chicago recovered 3,912 guns, Los Angeles got 2,296 and New York 1,385. That wasn’t an anomaly, according to Daniel Webster, director of the Johns Hopkins Center for Gun Policy and Research, who has testified before Congress in favor of strengthening federal measures to reduce gun trafficking. For several years under the Clinton administration, an effort to fight youth crime collected gun-tracing data for major U.S. cities. "I can tell you that Chicago consistently recovered more guns than any of the other cities, N.Y.C. and L.A. included," Webster said. We pulled those reports from 1998, 1999 and 2000. Chicago recovered and traced more guns than either New York or Los Angeles in all three years. In 1998, it picked up 16,222 weapons — more than the two larger cities together. Why? Webster points out that the city has a lot of gangs, and gangs and guns go together. Its police department cracks down on illegal gun possession, making arrests more likely. And Illinois gun control laws aren’t nearly as strong as those in New York and California in deterring gun trafficking into the city, he said. Webster told House Democrats in March that studies show state gun laws are undermined by gaps in federal law — people buy guns in states with the weakest laws to sell in states with the toughest laws. The same idea works for counties and cities. In Chicago, all it takes is a drive outside the city limits, the New York Times reported, such as to Chuck’s Gun Shop in Riverdale, Ill., the source of more than 1,300 weapons seized in Chicago since 2008. The same store was identified as a key source of crime guns in a New York Times piece in 1999. Our ruling Emanuel, arguing for stronger federal laws to help Chicago tamp down on gun crime, said, "we take more guns off the streets than New York or L.A." Gun seizure data gathered by the University of Chicago Crime Lab and a federal youth crime initiative show just that. We rate his statement True.

pomt-00717	Distracted driving such as texting behind the wheel is behind a rise in traffic deaths on Georgia roadways this year.	true	/georgia/statements/2015/apr/28/billboard-spaghetti-junction/distracted-driving-growing-factor-jump-roadway-fat/	As your Mom would tell you, you don’t have to be doing anything wrong on the road to be in danger. The heartbreaking deaths of five Georgia Southern nursing students in a pileup crash outside Savannah last week is evidence of that sad truth. But the Georgia Department of Transportation is trying also to draw attention to the number of traffic fatalities statewide and the driver behavior behind the deaths. "GEORGIA ROADWAY FATALITIES THIS YEAR: 388," flashed a DOT over I-75 in Cobb County on Thursday. "STAY ALERT. STAY ALIVE." Put in context, that’s more than three deaths every day, by the 113th day of the year. The implication of the sign suggests that driver behavior is contributing to those fatalities. But considering PolitiFact Georgia just fact-checked road fatalities in January, showing highway deaths appeared to be declining, could that trend already be reversing? And does driver behavior have anything to do with the trend? Yes and yes, according to Terri Pope, spokeswoman for the Northeast DOT region, when asked about the signs and numbers behind them. So far in 2015, traffic deaths are up 25 percent from last year, Pope said. The state is averaging 100 deaths a month on its roadways, putting it on track for 1,200 fatalities by year’s end. If that happens, it will be a 4.6 percent increase from 2014 numbers – and the first year-to-year increase in nine years. Even worse, of the year’s roadway deaths so far, only 38 percent of drivers were wearing seat belts and 69 percent failed to maintain their lane – behaviors that experts say save lives behind the wheel, Pope said. And, 60 percent of the fatalities were single-car crashes where the vehicle hit a tree, culvert or bridge or drifted into another lane. "Those statistics show that drivers, now more than ever, are driving distracted or are driving impaired," Pope wrote in an email. So the number of roadway deaths in Georgia is definitely on the rise. But has distracted driving – such as the use of a cell phone – also increased as a contributing factor in those crashes? The state DOT does not have 2015 data with that information, since local law enforcement agencies would determine causes as part of investigations that will lag behind the actual accidents. But the type of accidents – those single-car crashes into fixed objects or failing to maintain the lane – indicate the driver was distracted by something. The Governor’s Office of Highway Safety provided PolitiFact Georgia with statistics on distracted driving from 2009 to 2014. The data, with last year’s numbers still considered preliminary are: Type 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 Total crashes 3,454 3,922 4,079 6,829 8,179 8,5,81 Injury crashes 862 1,102 1,022 1,800 2,091 2,275 Total injured 1,174 1,596 1,420 2,617 3,082 3,298 Fatality crashes 11 13 10 9 11 18 Total fatalities 11 23 14 9 13 19 Looking at those numbers, it’s clear the number of fatal crashes in which distracted driving was a factor jumped nearly 64 percent in five years. The increase in the number of deaths was even worse: up nearly 73 percent in the five years (though down 17 percent from a high-water year in 2010). The same factors that had been helping push down roadway deaths – safer cars, stepped up enforcement of drunken driving and roadway enhancements – are likely to have allowed for more injuries in crashes, said Harris Blackwood, director of the highway safety office. But still, the number of people injured in distracted driving crashes jumped 181 percent in the five years. "Driver error is a major factor in a lot of these crashes that have happened and in these increased fatal crashes," Blackwood said. "You’ve just got to get your focus on that road. The life you save is going to be yours." With a busy summer season of driving ahead, that is the message transportation officials hope gets through the numbers. The state DOT has begun flashing messages on Georgia roadways, indicating driver behavior is causing an increase in traffic fatalities. The numbers bear out that increase. And the kind of crashes, and data from previous years, indicates driving while distracted with texting and phone use is likewise on the rise. We rate the DOT’s claim True.

pomt-00711	Minnesota’s "advantage" in economic growth has been having "Republicans in charge of at least one part of government" for all but two years, while Wisconsin Democrats "for many years" before 2011 controlled both legislative chambers and the governorship.	false	/wisconsin/statements/2015/apr/29/scott-walker/democrats-had-total-control-state-politics-many-ye/	Republican Gov. Scott Walker had it two ways while defending his state’s economic record during a stop in Minnesota as he moves toward a 2016 presidential bid. Some media outlets interpreted his remarks as pushing back on the idea that Wisconsin’s economic recovery trails that of Minnesota, where Democrat Mark Dayton is governor. But Walker also spoke of Minnesota’s "advantage" in terms of economic growth and attributed it to politics. "For many years, when (Republican Gov. Tim) Pawlenty was in office, the state was doing quite well," Walker said. "You've had the advantage of having, other than a two-year period, Republicans in charge of at least one part of government for at least some time," Walker added, then noted. "Before we came into office, for many years there was a Democratic governor, a Democratic Assembly and a Democratic Senate." We can’t fact check Walker’s implication that Wisconsin fell behind because Democrats were running the whole show. That’s his opinion. But we can check his facts on who was in charge and when. Walker didn’t say how far back his comparison went, but his mention of Pawlenty suggests at least 2003, when Pawlenty was first elected. Here’s what we found when examining partisan control in both states: Minnesota Pawlenty served two terms, from 2003 through 2010, giving way to Dayton at the same time Walker assumed power in Madison in January 2011. So that means Republicans controlled at least one key lever for those eight years. From 2011 to present it’s been Dayton, a member of the state’s Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party, in the governor’s chair in St. Paul. Republicans held both legislative chambers in 2011-12, and one starting in 2015. But Democrats -- as Walker correctly noted -- ran both chambers from 2013-14 and of course had Dayton for those years as well. Wisconsin Walker confined his argument here to the years before he took office in 2011. But he misfires in saying Democrats had a total lock on power for "many years." Democratic Gov. Jim Doyle took office in Wisconsin in 2003 -- at the same time Pawlenty assumed control next door. Doyle also served eight years, then decided not to run for a third term. But Doyle only had a Legislature under total Democratic control for his last two years, 2009 and 2010. In fact, Republicans controlled the Assembly and Senate for Doyle’s first four years. Control then was split for two years before Democrats enjoyed their brief unfettered reign. Going back further, to 1995, Republicans in Wisconsin controlled at least one of the three power spots every year until 2009. The kind of single-party dominance that Walker claimed Democrats have enjoyed for many years is rare in recent Wisconsin history. Walker, though, is now in year five with Republicans gripping all three levers of authority at the Capitol. Our rating Walker said Minnesota’s "advantage" has been having "Republicans in charge of at least one part of government" for all but two years, while Wisconsin Democrats "for many years" controlled both legislative chambers and the governorship before 2011. In making the comparison, though, he overstates how long the Democrats had total control in Wisconsin. It was for a two-year period, before he took office and Republicans won complete control. The Republicans have had that status more than twice as long as the "many years" Walker said Democrats did. We rate the claim False.

pomt-04793	Says that as Massachusetts governor, Mitt Romney "condemned coal-fired plants, saying they kill people."	mostly true	/ohio/statements/2012/aug/23/barack-obama/barack-obama-says-mitt-romney-condemned-coal-fired/	Mitt Romney came to coal country on Aug. 14, standing before a crowd of miners in eastern Ohio and pledging to fight for their jobs. You could be forgiven if you thought this was much ado about 3,150 jobs -- the number employed directly by coal operations in Ohio, at least before two mines announced layoffs recently. But Romney’s greater point was about how coal fires so many power plants in Ohio and the region, and how, he says, environmental regulation from President Barack Obama’s administration threatens jobs at those plants, too. This could drive up the cost of electricity for every Ohioan, Romney said. This debate -- over the cost of electricity, the shift among power plants to natural gas, the environmental and health risks, the role the government should or shouldn’t play -- has been building for years. And after the event, the Obama campaign had a response, saying that Romney’s position on coal has changed substantially since he was governor of Massachusetts. "Immediately after becoming governor, Romney condemned coal-fired plants, saying they kill people," said an Obama campaign news release. The claim was similar to one the Obama team made in a radio ad, and Obama reelection aides backed it with specific quotes Romney made in February, 2003, when Romney was the freshly elected governor of Massachusetts. The quotes: "That plant kills people." This was in reference to the Salem Harbor power plant, in the Boston area. "I will not create jobs that kill people." This, too, was made by Romney outside the Salem Harbor plant. The Obama campaign also highlighted a Romney quote that had no lethal references but was just as strong. It came from a state of Massachusetts news releasein which Romney said: "If the choice is between dirty power plants or protecting the health of the people of Massachusetts, there is no choice in my mind. I will always come down on the side of public health." Romney made each of these statements during a Feb. 6, 2003, showdown over the future of the controversial, coal-burning Salem Harbor Power Station. In 2001, Massachusetts passed new rules to reduce power plant emissions of nitrogen oxide, sulfur dioxide, carbon dioxide and mercury, to be phased in over several years. The mercury standard would not be finalized until 2004. Romney supported the rules, as he made clear repeatedly. Massachusetts singled out its most egregious polluters as the "Filthy Five" plants, including Salem Harbor. Public health and environmental scientists at Harvard studied the emissions from two of the plants in 2000 and concluded that Salem Harbor was responsible for 53 deaths, 570 emergency room visits, 14,400 asthma attacks and 99,000 incidents of upper respiratory symptoms -- all per year. As occurs with similar studies that health authorities cite, local residents and others who wanted to keep the Salem Harbor plant open (for jobs and tax revenue) disputed those figures, saying they resulted from unproven modeling. It turned out that the Harvard scientists had revised their figures in 2002, putting premature deaths from Salem Harbor’s pollution at 30 per year and reducing the number of emergency room visits to 400 and the asthma attacks at 2,000, according to the Boston Globe and the Boston Herald. But the scientists stood by the broader conclusion -- that emissions from dirty power plants can be deadly. The Harvard methodology has now been widely replicated and is respected by health scientists, according to several environmental authorities we spoke with. Romney appeared to accept their findings, too. In the above-mentioned news release, the commonwealth of Massachusetts quoted Romney in the third person on the danger factor: "Romney said that the Salem Harbor plant is responsible for 53 premature deaths, 570 emergency room visits and 14,400 asthma attacks each year. He also pointed out that coal and oil fired plants contribute significantly more air pollution than their gas fired counterparts, exacerbating acid rain and global warming." This was in a news release issued by the governor’s aides, not some radical outside instigator. It was issued under the name of Romney, Lt. Gov. Kerry Healey and Romney’s development chief, Douglas Foy. According to the Boston Globe, Romney hired Foy from the Conservation Law Foundation, or CLF, a leading environmental advocacy group in Massachusetts. The spat with Salem Harbor turned into a testy exchange that February day after Salem Harbor’s then-owner, Pacific Gas and Electric, sought an extension until 2006 to comply with Massachusetts’ emissions rules -- and plant supporters showed up to to demand that the governor back off. Romney was adamant that the company comply by 2004. His statements that day show how he felt: "That plant kills people." And to those including city officials who argued that this would cost jobs: "I will not create jobs that kill people." Based on some of the quotes, it might appear that Romney was speaking only about that single plant (which a new owner, Dominion, is phasing out, after which a subsequent third owner will build a natural gas plant there). That’s what we thought when we began looking into this. It is also what the Romney campaign told us in email. So was it accurate for the Obama campaign to imply that Romney’s words characterized his broader attitude toward coal emissions when he was governor? We kept looking, because people in the environmental community told us it was a valid claim. And the news release under Romney’s name suggested it as well. Romney spoke of plants, not just a single one, when he pointed out that coal and oil fired plants contribute significantly more air pollution than their gas fired counterparts, exacerbating acid rain and global warming. Still, to give him the benefit of doubt, what if he really just meant the Salem Harbor plant? Wasn’t that plant particularly egregious when compared with coal-fired plants under attack by federal regulators today? No, say environmentalists who include authorities from the CLF. Their claims are supported by U.S. EPA emissions data we verified independently. "When he said that ‘this plant kills people,’ he was talking about a plant that produced pollution comparable to the emissions of plants in the Midwest," said Seth Kaplan, vice president for policy and climate advocacy at the conservation foundation. Jonathan Peress, an environmental and regulatory attorney who works for the CLF and was recently chairman of the American Bar Association’s air quality committee, added in a separate interview with PolitiFact Ohio that Romney promoted Massachusetts air standards that were almost identical to those the U.S. EPA wants to enforce -- and that Romney now criticizes. "The levels of emissions that he was talking about were levels that were virtually identical to what the EPA has proposed," Kaplan agreed. "He was steadfastly standing behind emissions reductions that are the same as those currently attacked." To see if this was accurate -- that the emissions Romney decried were similar to or even weaker than those under current attack now by the EPA (whose rules Romney now attacks) -- we examined the emissions cuts that Massachusetts wanted and data on the level of sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides emissions at Salem Harbor and in the Midwest. The U.S. EPA keeps the information in its extensive Clean Air Markets database. Nitrogen oxides react with sunlight to create ozone and smog. Sulfur dioxide is tied to particulate matter and is considered particularly dangerous to health, said Jonathan Walke, a senior attorney with the Natural Resources Defense Council Action Fund. The level of both these substances was multiple times lower at Salem Harbor, even when Romney was trying to force the plant to reduce emissions, than at Eastlake in Northeast Ohio and several other Ohio plants we checked. Our comparisons included multiple years, including Salem Harbor in 2003 with Ohio plants in 2011. To compensate for differences in electricity output, number of boilers and hours of operation at different power plants, we checked the data for emissions per megawatt-hour. The pattern held. "It’s all the same pollution, albeit in higher quantities in Ohio," Walke said. You might ask why we looked at Eastlake. It’s because FirstEnergy Corp. plans to shut down two of that plant’s boilers rather than spend heavily on scrubbers to comply with EPA rules. This is one of several coal-burning plants at the heart of the current jobs-versus-pollution debate, although Romney did not mention it specifically. It’s important to note that the rules on nitrogen and sulfur are not what is prompting the FirstEnergy shutdowns. New EPA rules on mercury and toxic metals are the cause of planned closures in Eastlake. The tougher limits won’t take effect until 2014. The EPA aims to cut mercury emissions by 79 percent. But as the Massachusetts governor, Romney supported mercury reductions in his state, too. In 2004, he signed off on a rule aiming to reduce mercury emissions by 95 percent by 2012. With Romney’s name on the letterhead, Massachusetts in May, 2004, issued a lengthy set of justifications for the mercury rule. Among them: "First, [new research] confirms and extends our understanding of mercury's harmful effects on learning, attention and other critical cognitive skills in children. Recent studies have found that children exposed to mercury levels may show signs of attention deficit disorder, impaired visual-spatial skills and poor coordination." Romney was "a champion" of those mercury regulations, said Shanna Cleveland, a staff attorney with the Conservation Law Foundation. "He was one of the reasons we got them through." Time to clean up: Romney was discussing a specific power plant, Salem Harbor, when he said, "That plant kills people." But the public record shows that his comments were part of a broad emissions-cutting program he embraced. And the power plant that he considered deadly had emissions that were no worse, and in many cases lower, than at Midwest plants that he would now wants left alone, citing the use of affordable and abundant coal. If one were to have supported the regulations Romney wanted in 2003, it’s fairly safe to assume that "one would also support such things nationally," said Jonathan Levy, an environmental scientist at Boston University and Harvard and co-author of the now heavily replicated study on the correlation between coal-burning power plants and respiratory health. The Obama campaign claimed that as governor, Romney condemned coal plants as killers. He spoke at times of a single plant, but at other times made clear that other plants also needed to cut emissions for the sake of public health. This even included new rules for mercury reductions -- the same substance from coal plants that now is prompting closures in Ohio. The debate over coal involves calculations of costs, the abundance or scarcity of natural resources, health and environmental risks, and attitudes about government regulation. It is not our role to say Romney was right or wrong at one time. But with additional information from emissions data, interviews and the public record of his governorship, the Obama campaign claim about Romney’s coal position of nine years ago is nearly as clear as a haze-free day. On the Truth-O-Meter, it rates Mostly True.	None	Barack Obama	None	None	None	2012-08-23T06:00:00	2012-08-14	['Massachusetts', 'Mitt_Romney']
pomt-12125	House Bill 330 "grants immunity from liability to motorists who strike protesters."	mostly false	/north-carolina/statements/2017/aug/16/roy-cooper/cooper-says-nc-bill-gives-immunity-drivers-who-str/	As graphic images emerged from Virginia over the weekend of a car crashing into a crowd of people, some turned their attention to a proposed North Carolina law that aims to protect drivers who inadvertently injure protesters in the street. House Bill 330 was introduced in response to protests in Charlotte last fall, when some residents who were upset about the police shooting of Keith Lamont Scott blocked interstate highways and other roads in the city. The N.C. House of Representatives approved the bill this spring but it hasn’t been considered by the state Senate. The bill drew renewed scrutiny after an Ohio man named James Fields, 20, allegedly rammed his car into a crowd of people protesting a white supremacist rally in Charlottesville, Va. The car killed one woman and injured 19 others. The news sparked fears that drivers in North Carolina could hit protesters without legal repercussions. On Tuesday, Gov. Roy Cooper called for legislators to let the bill die. "The North Carolina legislature should defeat a bill that grants immunity from liability to motorists who strike protesters. That bill passed the state House and remains alive in the Senate. The Senate should kill it. Full stop. Those who attack protesters, weaponizing their vehicles like terrorists, should find no safe haven in our state." he wrote. We wondered whether the bill really "grants immunity from liability to motorists who strike protesters," as Cooper said. A ‘tightly tailored’ bill? Cooper spokesman Ford Porter elaborated on the governor’s statement in an email. "The purpose of the bill is to immunize certain drivers from findings of liability. Courts already take into consideration the circumstances surrounding an accident – this legislation adds vague new protections specifically for people who hit protesters with their cars," Porter said. "That sends the wrong message and opens the door to potentially serious consequences. Governor Cooper has been clear that our state has no business going down this path." The bill’s authors, Republican state Reps. Justin Burr and Chris Millis, released a statement saying the bill is "tightly tailored" to protect drivers as well as people who are lawfully exercising their First Amendment rights. "It is intellectually dishonest and a gross mischaracterization to portray North Carolina House Bill 330 as a protection measure for the act of violence that occurred in Charlottesville this past weekend," Burr and Millis said. "Any individual who committed a deliberate or willful act, such as what happened this weekend in Charlottesville, would face appropriately severe criminal and civil liabilities." What the bill says The one-page bill, which is short by legislative standards, aims to provide legal immunity from personal-injury lawsuits to motorists who exercise "due care" when driving but injure someone who blocks traffic while participating in a protest. The bill expresses important distinctions: it wouldn’t apply to drivers who injure protesters through "willful or wanton" actions; nor would it apply to drivers who injure someone who has a permit to protest in the street. It also wouldn’t apply to someone being criminally prosecuted. And it certainly wouldn’t allow drivers to "weaponize" their cars without legal consequence. In short, the bill doesn't grant immunity to anyone who hits a protester on purpose. What it changes Attorneys and legal experts doubt that the bill would have much impact because state laws already offer broad protections to drivers who accidentally hit people who are unlawfully in the street. In North Carolina, Virginia, Alabama and Maryland, state law makes it difficult for a plaintiff to win. Other states apply the doctrine of "comparative fault." Let’s say a protester in a comparative fault state is found to be 20 percent responsible for his or her injury and a driver is found to be 80 percent at fault. State laws in those states merely limit – not block – the amount of money awarded to the protester. In North Carolina, by contrast, state laws apply the doctrine of "contributory negligence." If a defendant proves "that the Plaintiff is even 1 percent responsible for their injuries – they lose automatically," said T. Greg Doucette, a criminal defense and business litigation attorney based in Durham. Doucette said the effect of the bill is unknown because it’s untested. But, on the bill’s surface, it seems to change little about civil litigation. Proving intent If the bill were to pass, how would it play out in court? If a protester is in the street and doesn’t have a permit, but thinks a driver intentionally struck him with his car, the protester would have to prove "willful and wanton" intent. Donald Beskind, a Duke University professor who’s practiced law for more than 30 years, said juries in that kind of situation are asked to consider direct and circumstantial evidence. Most cases are clear cut, he said. "If you want to know if someone was careful, you would want to look at what they were doing at the time of the accident. If they were texting, we would infer they were not careful," Beskind said. If someone drove into protesters and "on the back side of their car there was a sign that said ‘Kill the Antifa,’ we would assume they were being willful," he added, referring to the anti-fascist political organization. Inspiring recklessness? Effectiveness or ineffectiveness aside, attorneys said the bill might inspire violent acts by people who don’t understand the laws. "While I don’t think it would make the Charlottesville thing legal by any stretch of the imagination, it could embolden someone to do something like the Charlottesville guy did," said David Stradley, a personal injury lawyer in Raleigh. "We just don’t need to be encouraging people to do something around a demonstration." Our ruling Cooper overstates what this bill would do. And legal experts say that, while untested, the bill doesn't appear to change litigation and might not offer any additional protections at all. We rate this claim Mostly False.

pomt-12391	"Due to the recent downturn in steel production, more than 13,600 Americans have been laid off and the steel industry is facing billions in losses."	true	/missouri/statements/2017/may/30/claire-mccaskill/mccaskill-mark-steel-industry/	As a candidate, President Donald Trump made trade fairness a signature issue, criticizing countries like China for "dumping" artificially cheap steel in U.S. markets and blaming the practice for a loss of American jobs. One day before Trump met Chinese President Xi Jinping at his Mar-a-Lago estate in April, Missouri Sen. Claire McCaskill issued a news release urging president Trump to address the issue of steel dumping. McCaskill backed up her comments by saying, "Due to the recent downturn in steel production, more than 13,600 Americans have been laid off and the steel industry is facing billions in losses." Those are some big numbers McCaskill threw out there, so we set out to see if they were accurate. What we found may be worse than what McCaskill originally thought. Jobs are going away The first part of Sen. McCaskill’s statement, "More than 13,600 Americans have been laid off," is accurate. When PolitiFact Missouri asked McCaskill’s office for the supporting data, her press secretary offered a spreadsheet from the Bureau of Labor Statistics’ website tracking the amount of steel mill jobs on a monthly basis. Her press secretary said the 13,600 figure was between January 2015 and May 2016. In January 2015, 153,500 Americans were employed in steel mills. By May 2016, that number had fallen to 139,900. But it’s important to note that the loss of steel jobs in America isn’t a recent trend. In fact, more than 20,000 steel jobs have been lost in the U.S. since the start of 2007. Historical data paint a grim picture of the state of steel jobs in America. According to the BLS, all "primary metals" jobs have dropped from 688,000 in 1990 to just 379,000 by March of 2017. In other words, in the past 27 years, nearly half of the metal-related jobs in America have been eliminated. Why are jobs disappearing? A common reason offered as to why steel jobs are leaving is that countries, primarily China, participate in "steel dumping." Dumping is when a country sells goods outside its home market for a cheaper rate than they are sold in the home country. Despite dumping being illegal since the 1940s, it remains an issue in the steel industry. "We’ve seen pretty significant job loss, which we believe is attributable to the global trade problem," said Kevin Dempsey, the senior vice president for public policy at the American Iron and Steel Institute. "There’s a big crisis with massive steel overcapacity. High levels of imports have led to (U.S.) steel mills being shut down." Dempsey said efforts to address the issue have been underway for some time. The issue was a hot topic at last year’s G20 summit. And a global forum on steel access capacity meets on a regular basis as it tries to stop the "underlying policy problems" facing the country, according to Dempsey. Trump is expected to sign an executive order barring steel dumping. "It’s really tough going because no country wants to bear all the pain of that," Dempsey said. "China is reluctant to make changes, but we’re going to continue on pressing to change that." What kind of shape is the steel industry in? The second part of McCaskill’s claim states: "The steel industry is facing billions in losses." While McCaskill’s press secretary did not offer data on the profit losses of the steel industry, our own research paints a dark picture. Steel dumping has crushed the profits of the U.S. steel industry. Low demand and large debt burdens are also challenging domestic producers. US Steel revenues went from $17.5 billion in 2014 to $11.5 billion in 2015. Revenue declined 13 percent at Steel Dynamics. Labor relations problems cut Allegheny Technologies’ bottom line in 2015. The list of companies that have lost significant money in the steel industry goes on and on. Our ruling McCaskill said, "Due to the recent downturn in steel production, more than 13,600 Americans have been laid off and the steel industry is facing billions in losses." Both parts of the senator’s statements have been proven accurate as forces like steel dumping have led to job cuts and billions of dollars of losses in America. We rate McCaskill’s statement True.

pomt-09172	When Roy Barnes was governor, "Georgia created 235,000 jobs."	half-true	/georgia/statements/2010/jun/04/roy-barnes/chalkboard-job-figures-dont-add/	A TV ad for the Roy Barnes gubernatorial campaign harks back to a rosier time in Georgia history -- the last recession. The ad, called "Chalkboard," says that the number of jobs in this state rose from 1999 through 2003 while Barnes was governor, even though his term included a recession that ended nationally in November 2001. Georgia struggled to add jobs until 2003. The commercial puts it this way: "Roy Barnes will make Georgia work. Again. When he was governor, Georgia created 235,000 jobs. We can do it again. And more." Georgia created jobs? Despite the recession? Barnes' statement implies that his actions led to the creation of these jobs, an assertion that is impossible to prove. Many factors encourage job creation, and many of those are outside any governor's purview. What we can do is establish whether he left Georgia's economy as healthy as he portrayed it to be. Here goes: The Barnes campaign credits the data to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, which collaborates with state governments to publish monthly figures on the country's economic health. Those figures show that while employment ticked up and down during Barnes' tenure, when it was all said and done Georgia was left with more than 238,000 additional jobs. In December 1998, the number of people employed was 3,925,076. By December 2002, it was 4,163,184. Generally, economists think an increase in employment is good. Yet a closer look shows that despite the growth, jobs grew tougher to get under the Barnes administration. Those same BLS figures show Georgia's unemployment rate rose a full percentage point from 3.9 percent to 4.9 percent. The number of unemployed Georgians grew by more than 52,000. We interviewed two experts who said job growth and unemployment can take place at the same time because during a recession job-seekers often give up and the labor force shrinks. As the economy picks up, the number of available jobs grows. So does the labor force. People who gave up looking for work decide to give it another shot. But until there are enough jobs to absorb the expanding labor force, unemployment grows, too. So during the end of Barnes' watch, things weren't great for job-seekers. But overall, economic data show the state's economy did grow. Georgia's overall gross domestic product grew from about $224 billion to $267 billion. Georgia's annual personal income -- the income received by all the residents of the state -- increased during Barnes' time as well. Barnes' statement was correct but gave the impression that employment conditions were stronger than they were. We therefore rate Barnes' claim as Half True.

pomt-12349	The House Republican health care bill "guts protections against massive price hikes for Georgians with pre-existing conditions."	half-true	/georgia/statements/2017/jun/13/jon-ossoff/ossoff-gop-health-plan-guts-protections-pre-existi/	Health care dominated the final debate in the special election to fill Georgia’s 6th Congressional District seat. Republican Karen Handel argued that people with pre-existing conditions would do fine under the House Republican’s American Health Care Act. Democrat Jon Ossoff pushed back against the former secretary of state. "It's fine to say, madam secretary, that someone cannot be denied coverage period if they have a pre-existing condition," Ossoff said. "But if there's no limit on price discrimination and the plan is unaffordable, that is a useless protection. And it is a fact that this bill guts protections against massive price hikes for Georgians with pre-existing conditions." The treatment of pre-existing conditions has emerged as one of the thorniest issues in the health care debate. We decided to explore how the Republican bill compares with the current law, the Affordable Care Act. Some basics Both the existing Affordable Care Act and the proposed American Health Care Act require insurance companies to sell everyone a plan. If you want to buy, they must sell. That’s called guaranteed issue, but the rules under the two approaches are different. The Affordable Care Act says carriers can’t base rates on a person’s health status. That’s the default for the American Health Care Act, too, but it gives states another choice. They can get a waiver that allows companies to charge more for people with higher health care risks who have a break in their insurance coverage. The GOP’s health care bill allows states to use two different approaches that could affect people with pre-existing conditions. States could let insurance companies base rates on a person’s health status, and they could trim the list of health services that every plan must offer. The Affordable Care Act requires 10 basic services, including maternity care and mental health treatment. Those two are mentioned most often as being at risk if states decide to trim the list. The American Health Care Act sets aside $8 billion for states that get waivers to use in a number of ways. They could use a portion to help cover the costs of high-risk people. There would be additional billions for all states to write down the costs of maternity and mental health care. No one can say for sure how this would play out. Assessing the future The Congressional Budget Office, the nonpartisan analytic arm of Congress, estimated that one-sixth of Americans would live in states that chose both to trim the list of essential health services and allow insurers to charge sicker people more. In those places, the CBO said "less healthy people would face extremely high premiums, despite the additional funding that would be available." "Over time, it would become more difficult for less healthy people (including people with preexisting medical conditions) in those states to purchase insurance because their premiums would continue to increase rapidly," the CBO said. Health policy analyst Joe Antos at the American Enterprise Institute, a market-oriented think tank, said no one knows which states will ask for waivers, much less whether Georgia would. Also unknown is how states would change the rules for insurance companies. But even if states allowed insurance companies to charge higher rates for people with pre-existing conditions who let their coverage lapse, he said the maximum number of people who would be adversely affected would be relatively small. "If they have insurance, they will try to keep it, because they know exactly that they will be big spenders and they want someone else to pay for it," Antos said. Antos said that there’s a "distinct possibility" that some people would face higher costs, but political pressure would limit how far states would go. Another mitigating actor is the billions of dollars in the American Health Care Act for states to set up high-risk pools. That money would move the most expensive patients off the private insurance rolls. Gail Wilensky, a top health care adviser to President George H.W. Bush, said that with enough funding, this could give such people better care than they get today. But Wilensky doesn’t think the current bill has set aside enough money. "Protections are greater under the Affordable Care Act," Wilensky said. "That’s why it costs as much as it does." Matthew Fielder, a health policy fellow at the Brookings Institution in Washington, said that by design, the Republican proposal gives states more latitude. "Under current law, people are completely protected against being charged a higher premium because of a pre-existing condition, no matter where in the country they live," Fiedler said. "Under the American Health Care Act, those protections could be significantly curtailed or eliminated entirely, depending on the decisions made by state officials." Our ruling Ossoff said the American Health Care Act "guts protections against massive price hikes for Georgians with pre-existing conditions." Based on the CBO report, a sixth of all Americans live in states where people with pre-existing conditions would be priced out of the market. No one knows if Georgia would be such a state, or if it were, if it would use waivers to the fullest extent. No expert we reached said the proposed American Health Care Act insulates people from higher rates as much as the current Affordable Care Act does. They differed on the scale of the impact. Ossoff has a point that the protections are weaker, but he pushed too far on the specifics for Georgia. We rate this claim HalfTrue.

pomt-02529	A bill backed by Sean Duffy and other House Republicans "could actually require the Internal Revenue Service to conduct audits of rape victims" who get an abortion.	false	/wisconsin/statements/2014/feb/09/state-democratic-party-wisconsin/could-gop-bill-targeting-abortion-require-irs-rape/	The Wisconsin Democratic Party combined abortion, IRS audits and rape in a fund-raising appeal it made Jan. 19, 2014. Like many fund-raising emails, this one opened by sounding many alarms: "Extreme, right-wing Republicans in Congress like Sean Duffy are doubling down on their War on Women with a completely terrifying proposal that not only makes it harder for women -- even those using private insurance -- to access safe, legal abortions, it could actually require the Internal Revenue Service to conduct audits of rape victims." If the proposal became law, could the IRS really be required to audit rape victims? The legislation The email targets the "No Taxpayer Funding for Abortion Act," which was introduced by New Jersey Republican Chris Smith in May 2013. Duffy, the GOP congressman who represents central Wisconsin, was one of 167 Republican co-sponsors; there were also four Democratic co-sponsors. With the U.S. Senate controlled by Democrats, the bill stands only a 14 percent chance of becoming law, according to the nonpartisan GovTrack.us. Nevertheless, the Wisconsin Democratic Party’s email said, the bill could become model legislation for states to adopt. When the Democratic Party distributed its email, the bill included a provision that the party claims could require the IRS to audit rape victims. Nine days later, when the GOP-controlled House approved the bill, that provision had been removed. As we do with all fact-checks, we’re evaluating the Democratic Party’s claim based on the facts at the time the claim was made -- in this case, when the provision singled out by the party was still in the bill. That version would have prohibited taxpayers from claiming a medical expense deduction for an abortion, except in cases of rape or incest -- leading some critics to decry so-called "rape audits." Nothing in the text of the legislation, however, spells out any conditions under which the IRS could be required to audit women who claim a medical expense deduction for an abortion. Likewise, analyses from two nonpartisan offices -- one by the Congressional Research Service and one by Congressional Budget Office -- make no reference to audits. So, where does the Wisconsin Democratic Party’s claim come from? Party’s evidence Asked to back up the claim, Democratic Party spokeswoman Melissa Baldauff told us: "Any time someone claims a deduction on their taxes, they could be subject to verify that deduction for the Internal Revenue Service via an audit." Yes. But that’s different than the party's claim of new legislation setting up a situation in which the IRS could be required to conduct certain audits. Three articles Baldauff provided make a less-sweeping assertion. They say the bill could put women in the position of having to prove to the IRS that their medical expense deduction for an abortion was legal because their pregnancy was caused by rape. We received similar comments from two other opponents of the bill. George Washington University health policy professor Susan Wood told us that if a woman were audited for any reason, and the IRS questioned her deduction for an abortion expense, the woman might have to prove that her pregnancy was due to rape in order to show that the tax deduction was legal. American University law professor Sharon Levin, who directs federal reproductive health policy at the National Women’s Law Center, said the bill "could lead to some women having to document to IRS auditors that they had been raped if they took a tax deduction for an abortion." Let’s get a better understanding of how audits work. How audits work First of all, there are no statutes that proscribe when the IRS must conduct audits, Baker Tilly tax expert and former IRS attorney Mark Heroux told us. Rather, the IRS uses its discretion, considering various factors, in deciding which tax returns to review, he said. Secondly, when taxpayers claim medical expense deductions, the total amount of the deduction appears on their returns; the medical expenses and procedures are not itemized. As for which returns get audited, here’s how the IRS summarizes the process: When tax returns are filed, they are compared against "norms" for similar returns. The "norms" are developed from audits of "a statistically valid random sample of returns." In other words, on its first pass, the IRS flags returns that are outliers. For example, a taxpayer with modest income who claims unusually high deductions for medical expenses or charitable donations. Then a series of reviews is done to determine whether there will be an audit. Flagged returns are examined by an IRS auditor. The auditor can decide to accept the return or refer it to an "examining group." If the group doesn’t accept the return, a manager reviews it and decides whether to accept it as filed, or assign it to an auditor. Finally, that auditor accepts the return or "contacts the taxpayer to schedule an appointment." So, the IRS has considerable discretion in deciding which returns to audit. And, again, nothing in the bill targeted by the Wisconsin Democratic Party requires audits. Supporters Duffy’s office referred us to other supporters of the bill, including U.S. Rep. Diane Black, R-Tenn. Speaking on the House floor in 2011 -- when essentially the same bill, including the provision criticized by the Democrats, was being considered -- Black said "a woman would not have to list on a tax form that a specific medical expense was for an abortion. That’s simply not how the process works. It’s not how it works today, nor will it be how it works if this is signed into law." Because tax returns don’t contain itemized lists of procedures such as abortions, a return wouldn't get flagged by the IRS for possible auditing just because an abortion had been claimed as a medical expense deduction. So, a rape victim who claimed a medical expense deduction for an abortion would be put in the position of having to explain the deduction to the IRS only if her return were audited for some other reason, and only if medical expense deductions came into question. We’ll note again that the provision criticized by Democratic Party was in place when the party made its claim, but was removed before the bill was approved by the House. Our rating The Wisconsin Democratic Party said a bill backed by Duffy and other House Republicans "could actually require the Internal Revenue Service to conduct audits of rape victims" who get an abortion. The version of the bill criticized by the party did not contain any audit requirements. We rate the claim False. Follow us on Twitter and Facebook.

pomt-00259	Says Sen. Richard Blumenthal said he served in Vietnam in "Da Nang Province. Soldiers dying left and right as we battled up the hill." And "then he cried when (the press) caught him."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2018/oct/04/donald-trump/donald-trumps-inventions-about-richard-blumenthal-/	At a rally in Southaven, Miss., President Donald Trump denounced Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., for his support of Christine Blasey Ford’s testimony against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh. Trump dubbed Blumenthal "Da Nang Richard," a reference to a battleground in the Vietnam War. "This guy lied about his service," Trump said Oct. 2. "He didn't just say ‘Gee, I was in the service.’ No, he said, ‘I was in the Marines. Da Nang province. Soldiers dying left and right as we battled up the hill.’ This went on for 15 years when he was the attorney general of Connecticut. I thought he was a great war hero." Trump continued. "Here's a guy who was saying people were dying all around him. And he was never there. And then he cried when they caught him. He cried like a baby, like a baby." In a companion fact-check, we looked at Trump’s claim that Blumenthal "lied" about his Vietnam service. (Mostly True.) Here, we look at the rest of Trump’s words, the ones about Da Nang and crying. Trump is wrong that Blumenthal spun heroic war stories, and cried when he was called out for it. Vietnam legacy Both Blumenthal and Trump avoided serving in Vietnam. Trump benefited from four student deferments in college and one medical deferment (which Trump later said was for bone spurs in his heels), before being classified 4-F, unfit to serve. While Trump never claimed to have been there, Blumenthal sometimes did. Blumenthal enlisted in the Marine Corps Reserves in 1970. Until then, five deferments had kept him out of the war. Getting a coveted slot in the reserves reduced the chance of battlefield deployment. Blumenthal went through basic training and served six years in the Washington, D.C, area and Connecticut. In 2010, the New York Times reported that at a 2008 ceremony for veterans and senior citizens, Blumenthal said, "We have learned something important since the days that I served in Vietnam." The newspaper provided another example from a 2003 event. "When we returned, we saw nothing like this," Blumenthal told military families. "Let us do better by this generation of men and women." A day after the New York Times story, Blumenthal held a news conference in West Hartford, Conn. "I routinely describe my pride at having served in the United States Marine Corps Reserves during the Vietnam era," Blumenthal said, flanked by veterans. "On a few occasions, I have misspoken about my service. And I regret that, and I take full responsibility." There were no tears. Some argued that there also was no apology. Blumenthal released a statement about a week later saying, "I have made mistakes and I am sorry." We can find no record that Blumenthal ever described being in Da Nang or any other place in Vietnam. (And for the record, Da Nang is a city, not a province, although it serves the same administrative role as a province in Vietnamese governance.) We reached out to the White House and did not hear back. Our ruling Trump said Blumenthal said he saw battle in Da Nang, and "then he cried when they caught him." Blumenthal never spoke of fighting in Da Nang or anywhere else in Vietnam. He did not cry when he acknowledged his misleading statements. Those elements are pure Trump invention.

pomt-14908	"There was never a single shred of evidence presented to anyone" that the attacks in Benghazi, Libya, were "spontaneous, and in fact, the CIA themselves understood that early on."	half-true	/florida/statements/2015/nov/04/marco-rubio/marco-rubio-portrays-hillary-clinton-liar-her-stat/	U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio portrayed Hillary Clinton as lying about the circumstances of the Benghazi attack when she said the attacks were the result of an anti-Muslim video instead of al-Qaida-like terrorists. "There was not a single person on the ground in Benghazi who believed that it was a spontaneous uprising," he said in an interview on CNN on Oct. 29, 2015. CNN’s Chris Cuomo asked Rubio how it could be a lie if the CIA told Clinton it was due to a demonstration. Rubio replied: "She consistently, privately told people, over and over again, including in the early aftermath of it, that this was led by al-Qaida-like elements. There was never a single shred of evidence presented to anyone that this was spontaneous, and in fact, the CIA themselves understood that early on, irrespective of what the administration is telling you now." We wanted to fact-check what Rubio said about what the CIA understood, drawing on the seven congressional investigations that followed, as well as news articles provided by Rubio and testimony by officials that the Clinton campaign sent us. What we found is a very murky situation. It seems like there were indications early on that the attacks were not the result of simple protests. But also early on, some in the government did seem to think that demonstrations over the video were a factor. That constitutes something of a "shred," contrary to what Rubio said. Timeline of reports about what prompted the attacks To try to sort out the evidence, we created a timeline to show when information was shared about the reason for the attacks. (Other media have created their own timelines, including Factcheck.org and the Washington Post’s The Fact Checker.) Sept. 11, 2012: The attack on a U.S. diplomatic compound begins at 3:40 p.m. ET (9:40 p.m. in Benghazi); an attack on a CIA mission annex begins at 6 p.m. ET. Four Americans die in the attacks. Sept. 11, 2012: Defense Secretary Leon Panetta met with Defense Department officials a couple hours after the attack "to discuss the Benghazi attack and other violence in the region in reaction to the anti-Muslim video," according to a report from the bipartisan Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs. Several officials later told this committee that they believed it was a terrorist attack immediately or almost immediately. Sept. 11, 2012: Clinton issued a statement that didn’t indicate a cause for the attack but said, "Some have sought to justify this vicious behavior as a response to inflammatory material posted on the Internet." At 11:12 p.m. Clinton sent an email to her daughter Chelsea saying the attack was conducted by an al-Qaida like group. Another email revealed that Clinton, during a phone call with Libyan President Mohamed Magariaf around 8 p.m. ET, said she understood Ansar al-Sharia, an al-Qaida-affiliated group, claimed responsibility for the attacks. However, 24 hours after taking responsibility for the attacks, Ansar al-Sharia retracted the claim. Sept. 11, 2012: Two alerts were issued by the State Department Operations Center to administration officials, according to the House Republican Conference report. The first said the U.S. facilities were under attack, while the second linked the attacks to Ansar al-Sharia. Neither alert mentioned a protest related to the video. Sept. 12, 2012: In the first CIA assessment of the attacks, the CIA said "the presence of armed assailants from the incident’s outset suggests this was an intentional assault and not the escalation of a peaceful protest." According to the bipartisan House Intelligence Committee report, the CIA later said the initial assessment lacked supporting evidence and was subsequently left out of reports. Meanwhile, analysts "received 21 reports that a protest occurred in Benghazi." Fourteen of those reports were issued from the Open Source Center (a CIA intelligence center), while the rest came from the CIA, the Defense Department and the NSA. However, the bipartisan Senate Select Committee on Intelligence found issues with the reports because they included information from early news reports, not just original intelligence. The reports were also based on intercepted communications and informants’ tips, according to the New York Times. Sept, 12, 2012: President Barack Obama, speaking in the Rose Garden, said, "No acts of terror will ever shake the resolve of this great nation." While he didn’t refer to the video directly, Obama did say, "We reject all efforts to denigrate the religious beliefs of others." Sept. 15, 2012: The CIA’s chief of station in Tripoli wrote an email to the then-deputy director of the CIA saying that the attacks were "not an escalation of protests." The intelligence community "also had information that there were no protests outside the Temporary Mission Facility prior to the attacks, but did not incorporate that information into its widely circulated assessments in a timely manner," according to the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence report. Sept. 16, 2012: United Nations Ambassador Susan Rice appeared on five Sunday talk shows. She talked about the video several times and said, "We do not have information at present that leads us to conclude that this was premeditated or preplanned." She said on NBC’s Meet the Press that the current assessment was the attack was "a spontaneous reaction to what had just transpired hours before in Cairo -- almost a copycat of the demonstrations against our facility in Cairo, which were prompted, of course, by the video." The administration was later criticized for the talking points fed to Rice in advance of her interviews. In an email from Ben Rhodes, the then-deputy national security adviser for strategic communications, one of those talking points stated: "Since we began to see protests in response to this Internet video, the president has directed the administration to take a number of steps." Sept. 18, 2012: The CIA and FBI reviewed video footage from the Benghazi compound that showed no protests preceding the attack. Sept. 19, 2012: Director of National Intelligence Matt Olsen said during a congressional hearing that the State Department officials in Benghazi died "in the course of a terrorist attack on our embassy." Sept. 20, 2012: Clinton said during a press conference that "the video that sparked these protests is disgusting and reprehensible, and the United States government, of course, had absolutely nothing to do with it." Sept. 21, 2012: Clinton attributed the attack to terrorism during a press conference: "What happened in Benghazi was a terrorist attack, and we will not rest until we have tracked down and brought to justice the terrorists who murdered four Americans." Sept. 24, 2012: The CIA changed its assessment of the attacks after determining that no protests occurred outside the Benghazi facility before the attacks. Sept. 28, 2012: Shawn Turner, a spokesperson for the Director of National Intelligence, issued a statement that officials initially thought that the attack was spontaneous but soon concluded that terrorists were involved: "In the immediate aftermath, there was information that led us to assess that the attack began spontaneously following protests earlier that day at our embassy in Cairo. We provided that initial assessment to Executive Branch officials and members of Congress, who used that information to discuss the attack publicly and provide updates as they became available. ... As we learned more about the attack, we revised our initial assessment to reflect new information indicating that it was a deliberate and organized terrorist attack carried out by extremists." Rubio campaign evidence As for whether there was never "a single shred of evidence" presented that the attack was spontaneous despite what Clinton said, a spokeswoman for Rubio pointed to news articles in conservative media about what Clinton and the former acting CIA director Michael Morell said about the attacks. For example, in an Oct. 23, 2015, Fox News report, Charles Woods, father of Ty Woods, who died in the Benghazi attack, shared diary notes he took after meeting Clinton on Sept. 14, 2012. The two spoke at a ceremony when the victims’ bodies were flown back to the United States. "I gave Hillary a hug and shook her hand. And she said we are going to have the filmmaker arrested who was responsible for the death of my son," the entry said. In Morell’s 2015 book The Great War of Our Time, Morell wrote, "Still others might have been motivated by the video -- although I should note our analysts never said the video was a factor in the Benghazi attacks." Clinton campaign evidence Clinton’s campaign also pointed to statements made by government officials who described initial confusion. "I think that the first week after 9/11, there was significant uncertainty about what had happened and disagreement among key people who shaped opinion," State Department Office Director for Maghreb Affairs William Roebuck told the Democratic Staff Committee on Oversight and Government Reform in August 2013. Adding to the confusion was that the Benghazi attack occurred around the same time as protests over the anti-Muslim video in Cairo. "There was some confusion about have you had -- was this the same thing, were these two incidents the same, were they different?" Roebuck said. "The interagency was trying to sort that out. They were also trying to sort out the conflicting information from Benghazi itself. ... Like I said, there was a dispute among people who were looking very carefully at all of the evidence on the ground, and there was a legitimate disagreement about what had sort of been the precursor to the attack." Our ruling Rubio said on CNN, "There was never a single shred of evidence presented to anyone that this was spontaneous, and in fact, the CIA themselves understood that early on." There was some initial confusion about what sparked the Sept. 11, 2012, attack. Although investigations showed that some officials thought it was a terrorist attack immediately, there at least appeared to be some question about whether the video could have played a role. Rubio exaggerates when he said there wasn’t a "single shred of evidence." There were several suggestions that it was because of a protest. However, he has a point that much of the early evidence pointed strongly to terrorism. Overall, we rate his statement Half True. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/d256b515-5bde-440a-9f3b-6f423cf6741c	None	Marco Rubio	None	None	None	2015-11-04T15:46:10	2015-10-29	['Libya', 'Benghazi', 'Central_Intelligence_Agency']
pomt-03509	Says President Barack Obama is trying to "pack" the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals.	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2013/jun/05/chuck-grassley/barack-obama-trying-pack-dc-circuit-court-appeals/	In the Rose Garden on June 4, 2013, President Barack Obama named three nominees to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit, a pivotal moment in a long-simmering partisan fight over the nation’s second-most influential court. That prompted Republican lawmakers to sharpen their rhetoric, accusing Obama of trying to "pack" the court -- a phrase that invokes the 1937 proposal by President Franklin D. Roosevelt to increase the size of the Supreme Court by as many as five justices. It’s no small charge: FDR’s scheme was seen, then and now, as a naked power grab. By proposing to sidestep a court that had blocked much of his New Deal agenda, Roosevelt alienated many Americans, and the plan ended up in history’s dustbin. Court packing "had always had a bad name, but Roosevelt’s proposal was such a fiasco that no subsequent president has even seen it as an option open to them," said Jeff Shesol, author of Supreme Power: Franklin Roosevelt vs. The Supreme Court and a speechwriter for President Bill Clinton. Several senators, including Minority Leader Mitch McConnell and Mike Lee, R-Utah, have recently made the "packing" charge. In a May 16 hearing, the ranking Republican on the Senate Judiciary Committee, Chuck Grassley of Iowa, used a variation of the word "pack" no fewer than six times. He repeated the charge in a news release on the eve of Obama’s announcement: "It’s hard to imagine the rationale for nominating three judges at once for this court given the many vacant emergency seats across the country, unless your goal is to pack the court to advance a certain policy agenda." Superficially, Obama’s actions don’t seem to mirror FDR’s, since Obama is seeking to fill existing vacancies, rather than creating new seats he can fill. But do the Republicans have a point? What’s the definition of "court packing"? Most historians and legal scholars offer similar definitions of "court packing." Burt Solomon, author of FDR v. The Constitution: The Court-Packing Fight and the Triumph of Democracy, called it an effort to "expand the size of the court" to stack it with supporters. Kermit Roosevelt, a University of Pennsylvania law professor, agreed, saying it "indicates a departure from the ordinary process." (Roosevelt is the great-great-grandson of President Theodore Roosevelt and a distant relative of FDR.) And Carl Tobias, a University of Richmond law professor, called it a "manipulation of court membership to achieve certain substantive results in cases the court will decide." Historical examples of court packing The highest-profile examples have come at the Supreme Court level. The Constitution doesn’t specify the number of Supreme Court seats. Starting at six in 1789, it briefly fell to five in 1801 before returning to six in 1802. It rose to seven in 1807 and nine in 1837. It rose to 10 in 1863, then shrunk to seven in 1866 before stabilizing at nine in 1869. These changes weren’t necessarily nefarious. Initially, the nation was growing geographically, which required more justices, and the increase in 1863 can be explained by the Civil War, which left the court with several justices from states in rebellion. We found three pretty clear historical examples in which one branch of government sought to change the makeup of the courts for political reasons. • The "midnight judges." In 1801, following a contentious election, the lame-duck Federalist administration of President John Adams sought to stymie the incoming Democratic-Republicans of President Thomas Jefferson by adding six new federal circuits with 16 judges, all appointed by Adams. The last-minute appointees came to be known as "midnight judges." The Jeffersonians sought to abolish the new courts, and in 1803, the Supreme Court upheld their right to do so in Stuart vs. Laird. • The post-Civil War era. After President Abraham Lincoln’s assassination, a southerner, Andrew Johnson, was elevated to president. After clashing with the Republicans who controlled Congress, they shrunk the Supreme Court from 10 seats to seven, effectively denying Johnson any appointments. After Johnson was succeeded by victorious Union Gen. Ulysses S. Grant, Congress restored the Supreme Court to nine justices. It has not varied since. • The third example, as we’ve noted, is Roosevelt’s doomed 1937 proposal. The Republicans’ arguments A spokeswoman for Grassley argued that, "just as FDR did, Obama is trying to influence the courts because neither president liked being overturned. The president and Senate Democrats have made that clear in their comments." Republican lawmakers make two main arguments. • The court is under-worked, so Obama is trying to fill unneeded seats with Democrats. "It is evident that the D.C. Circuit is the least busy court" in the nation, Grassley said at the May 16 hearing. "In fact, it ranks last or almost last in nearly every category that measures the workload of the courts." In fact, Grassley has introduced the Court Efficiency Act of 2013, which would, among other things, reduce the number of D.C. Circuit judges from 11 to eight. Grassley’s proposal is "understandable," said Ilya Shapiro, a legal scholar at the libertarian Cato Institute. "The court isn’t overworked, the openings are there because of filibusters of Bush nominees, and Obama’s had five years to nominate people and hasn’t," he said. "There are lots of overworked courts out there to which these three slots could go, but he wouldn’t be making it if Obama weren’t making his political play." • Senate Democrats are threatening a structural change that would affect judicial nominations. In the Senate, a single lawmaker can hold up Senate business unless supporters can muster a 60-vote majority. Over the years, due to actions by senators from both parties, such blocking tactics have become increasingly common. Frustrated by this trend, recent Senate majorities from both parties have considered invoking the "nuclear option" -- a procedural move that would allow a minority blockage to be overcome with just 51 votes. In 2005, a bipartisan group of 14 senators successfully headed off a Republican attempt to invoke the nuclear option by pledging not to support judicial filibusters. Now, the tables have turned: Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev. has threatened the nuclear option to combat Republican opposition to Obama’s nominees. The Democrats’ arguments Democrats challenge both arguments. In his Rose Garden announcement, Obama cited an April report by the Judicial Conference of the United States, a nonpartisan body headed by Chief Justice John Roberts, which told Congress that the circuit should remain at 11 judges. Court observers add that caseload counts don’t account for the complexity of the circuit’s cases. Meanwhile, Democrats say they have been driven to consider the nuclear option by strenuous GOP obstructionism. Obama said on June 4 that his judicial nominees "have waited three times longer to receive confirmation votes than those of my Republican predecessor" and added that he had to withdraw the nomination of Caitlin Halligan for a D.C. Circuit vacancy earlier this year after waiting fruitlessly for confirmation since September 2010. "I recognize that neither party has a perfect track record here," Obama said. But calling the present deadlock "unprecedented," he added, "For the good of the American people, it has to stop." Who has the better of the arguments? Our experts agreed that Obama is trying to put his imprint on the court -- but they said he’s doing so within the bounds of his constitutional duty to fill court vacancies. Ironically, the experts said, Grassley’s bill comes closer to the kind of structural meddling typical of court packing than does Obama’s approach, even if Grassley’s bill would result in a shrinkage. The experts agreed with Grassley that judicial resources could be better allocated, but they added that this question is better addressed by a more politically insulated entity such as the Judicial Conference of the United States. Arguing for efficiency wasn’t enough to shield FDR from backlash, Shesol said. "Everybody knew the game," Shesol said. "The fact that he was dishonest about it was what really hurt him." The nuclear option would be a structural change, but one focused more narrowly on one branch’s procedures. This keeps the argument from being a slam dunk -- and it hasn’t happened yet "If the Democrats eliminate the filibuster, I would call that hardball," Roosevelt said. "But it’s a change to the Senate rules, so it’s not an attack on the integrity and independence of the judiciary in the way that court-packing is. It’s also something that the other side can benefit from later, which neither packing nor shrinking really is." Our ruling The claim that Obama is "packing" the D.C. Circuit Court largely runs counter to American legal and political history. Genuine court packing has involved one branch of government proposing to change the structure of the courts, either expanding or decreasing the number of judges. That's not what Obama's doing.

pomt-06541	An Environmental Protection Agency regulation that goes into effect Jan. 1, 2012, regulates dust.	false	/georgia/statements/2011/oct/05/herman-cain/herman-cain-epa-regulate-dust-2012/	It was the kind of question that any politician who opposes big government would love to field during a GOP presidential debate. "My question is, if you were forced to eliminate one department from the federal government, which one would you eliminate and why?" asked a man from Arlington, Va., via YouTube during the Sept. 22 debate in Orlando. A moderator chose metro Atlantan Herman Cain to answer it, and to the delight of the audience, he turned his hypothetical ax on a favorite target of big government foes: the Environmental Protection Agency. "Now, I know that makes some people nervous, but the EPA has gone wild. The fact that they have a regulation that goes into effect Jan. 1, 2012, to regulate dust says that they've gone too far," Cain replied. Dust? The EPA will start regulating dust in January? We contacted the Cain camp for evidence, but they didn’t reply. Fortunately, the EPA posted its reports on the issue online. Factcheck.org, a fact-checking operation similar to PolitiFact, looked into Cain’s comment as well. We found that the EPA has long regulated a category of air pollution called "particulate matter," which includes dust. There’s no new regulation scheduled for Jan. 1, 2012. Particle pollution is a floating mix of solid particles and liquid droplets. Sometimes, the particles are visible, like smoke from a power plant, haze, or the dust that Cain mentioned. Other times, they’re so small they’re invisible to the naked eye. These particulates can be made up of any number of chemicals, and can come from a variety of sources such as smokestacks, fires or construction sites. A growing body of scientific evidence links particle pollution to a variety of health problems, including respiratory issues, lung disease, heart problems and even higher death rates, according to multiple independent reviews of the scientific literature as well as the EPA. A small number of studies have even linked naturally occurring dust storms to a rise in trips to the emergency room for cardiovascular problems, according to an EPA review of scientific studies. The EPA has regulated this form of air pollution since 1971 under the Clean Air Act, and requires air monitors in areas with populations greater than 100,000, according to state and federal documents. But it does not specifically single out farm dust for regulation. Since states have to comply with the regulations or risk losing federal money, they may institute rules for farm dust to get into compliance with the law, a lobbyist for the farm industry and news accounts confirm. The Clean Air Act requires the EPA reviews its particle pollution standards every five years. And that’s where the current dust-up over dust began. The EPA released its most recent policy assessment in April. It concludes that based on the newest research, it’s worthwhile to consider tightening some standards on larger or "coarse" particulates. This category includes dust from landfills, construction sites, agriculture and industrial sources such as steel mills. The agriculture industry and other groups objected, saying this suggestion doesn’t make sense for rural areas, where tractors and pickups kick up naturally occurring dirt in the fields or on unpaved roads. But both the EPA and regulation opponents agree that no regulation is in the pipeline, and it’s certainly not coming Jan. 1. Factcheck.org’s Sept. 23 story on the debate noted that EPA Administrator Lisa Jackson testified before the U.S. House Committee on Agriculture in March that it was a "mischaracterization" that the EPA is trying to "expand regulation of dust from farms." Indeed, the EPA has not formally submitted new regulations for review, an agency spokeswoman told PolitiFact Georgia. Jackson said she would make a decision on whether to tighten the rules in July, according to a Reuters news story, but she has yet to do so. Even if the EPA were to submit such regulations today, it could take a year or so for them to go into effect, said Richard Krause, a lobbyist for the American Farm Bureau Federation. The EPA would have to make any proposal available for public review and comment, a process that could take some months. So to sum up: The EPA has been regulating large particulate matter, including dust, for four decades, but does not single out farm dust or require monitoring in more rural areas. EPA staffers and scientists concluded after an assessment of the most recent science that it’s worthwhile to consider tightening current regulations, but the EPA has not formally proposed any regulation, and even if they did so today, it could take a while for it to go into effect. So, Cain does have a point. The EPA does regulate dust under the Clean Air Act. But Cain’s language was very specific, and now that the dust has settled in the wake of the Republican debate, it’s clear his specifics were incorrect. Dust is regulated, but not at all in the way that Cain described. We therefore rate his statement False.	None	Herman Cain	None	None	None	2011-10-05T06:00:00	2011-09-22	['None']
pomt-04610	The "48, 49 percent" that supports President Barack Obama are "people who pay no income tax."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/sep/18/mitt-romney/mitt-romney-says-voters-who-support-barack-obama-a/	A surreptitiously recorded video of Mitt Romney speaking at a fundraiser stirred up the presidential race on Sept. 17, 2012. The video showed Romney saying that 47 percent of the American public are "dependent on government," "believe that they are victims" and "believe the government has a responsibility to care for them." Romney also claimed that the 47 percent of Americans who don't pay federal income taxes are strong Obama supporters because they are so dependent on government benefits that Obama freely provides. "There are 47 percent of the people who will vote for the president no matter what," Romney said, according to the video leaked to the liberal magazine Mother Jones. "All right, there are 47 percent who are with him, who are dependent upon government, who believe that they are victims, who believe the government has a responsibility to care for them, who believe that they are entitled to health care, to food, to housing, to you-name-it. That that's an entitlement. And the government should give it to them. And they will vote for this president no matter what. "And I mean the president starts out with 48, 49 percent … he starts off with a huge number," Romney continued. "These are people who pay no income tax. Forty-seven percent of Americans pay no income tax. So our message of low taxes doesn’t connect. So he’ll be out there talking about tax cuts for the rich. I mean, that’s what they sell every four years. And so my job is is not to worry about those people. I’ll never convince them that they should take personal responsibility and care for their lives. What I have to do is convince the five to 10 percent in the center that are independents, that are thoughtful...." Almost immediately after the video hit the news, we received a flood of requests from readers asking us to check Romney’s claims. In this item, we’ll look at whether the "48, 49 percent" that supports President Barack Obama are "people who pay no income tax." We should note that Romney, during a hastily called news conference in California, called his comments "not elegantly stated," but he didn’t backtrack from their substance. What he said is "a message which I'm going to carry and continue to carry, which is, look, the president's approach is attractive to people who are not paying taxes, because, frankly, my discussion about lowering taxes isn't as attractive to them. And therefore, I'm not likely to draw them into my campaign...." In this item, we'll look at who pays taxes -- and who doesn't. Then we'll look at whether Obama supporters and Americans who don’t pay taxes are one and the same. Who pays taxes Romney’s figure is close to one from the Urban Institute-Brookings Institution Tax Policy Center, which found that 46 percent of tax filers pay no income tax, vs. about 54 percent of tax filers that did have some federal income tax liability. Generally speaking, the groups most likely to have no tax liability are the elderly and the poor. Anti-tax Republicans tend to focus on the federal income tax burden because it helps make their case that the federal income tax burden falls disproportionately on the wealthy. Because there is a solid basis for this number, we’ve rated it True in the past -- at least when it is described correctly. That qualifier is important. While the 46 percent figure refers to federal income tax, federal income tax is not the only tax that Americans pay. It’s not even the only federal tax people pay. An additional 28 percent will at least pay federal payroll taxes, which funds Social Security and Medicare and is deducted from every working American’s paycheck. Most of the rest are the poor and elderly. So, Romney would have been right if he said about 47 percent of all Americans don't pay federal income taxes. But he went further, arguing that those 47 percent of Americans who don’t pay federal income taxes are essentially all Obama supporters. And the facts don't back him up. Obama supporters It's tricky to compare taxpaying status with presidential preferences, but there are enough data points that we can poke some significant holes in Romney’s argument. • Income levels. We compared Tax Policy Center data with a recent CBS News-New York Times poll. Among households with below $50,000 in income, 68 percent owed no federal income taxes, according to the Tax Policy Center. The poll showed Obama led in this group, 58 percent to 37 percent. For households between $50,000 and $100,000, 11 percent owed no federal income taxes. Romney led in this group, 50 percent to 47 percent. And for households above $100,000, 2 percent owed no federal income taxes. Romney led in this category, 57 percent to 41 percent. So there’s a modest correlation between the likelihood of not paying income taxes and the likelihood of supporting Obama. But Romney vastly overstates the link. Obama has substantial support among households $100,000 and up, and virtually all of them pay income taxes. Put another way, Obama is expected to win millions of votes from people who do pay federal income taxes, and Romney is expected to win millions of votes from people who do not pay federal income taxes. • Senior citizens. Romney gets strong support from seniors. He led in the CBS-New York Times poll by a 53 percent to 38 percent margin, and a CNN and Opinion Research Corp. poll from around the same time had Romney leading among senior by a 53 percent to 45 percent margin. Yet being a senior is one of the biggest reasons an American would pay no federal income taxes. Among those who saw tax breaks wipe out their income-tax liability, nearly half benefited from a tax break targeted at senior citizens. • State by state data. The Tax Foundation has found some state-by-state patterns that are problematic for Romney’s claim. The foundation tallied the states that had the highest percentages of non-income-tax-paying residents. The 10 states with the highest rates of non-tax-payers are mostly ones that Romney has in the bag -- Texas, Idaho, Arkansas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, Georgia and South Carolina. And several states with the lowest rates are solidly in Obama’s camp, including Minnesota, Maryland and Massachusetts. Our ruling Romney said that the "48, 49 percent" that supports President Barack Obama are "people who pay no income tax." But the polls and income tax data don't back this up. Obama gets substantial support from people earning more than $50,000 -- and 90 percent of them, or more, do pay taxes. And Romney gets lots of support from seniors, many of whom have no income tax liability. We rate the claim False.	None	Mitt Romney	None	None	None	2012-09-18T18:07:22	2012-05-17	['None']
pomt-14765	The U.S. "tax rate on successful small businesses is 44.6 percent," while the business tax rate in Canada is 15 percent.	true	/wisconsin/statements/2015/dec/10/paul-ryan/paul-ryan-says-us-taxes-small-businesses-446-perce/	Shortly after his election as House Speaker, U.S. Rep. Paul Ryan (R-Wis) spelled out his agenda for Fox News anchor Greta Van Susteren. A key concern is tax reform, Ryan said during the Nov. 4, 2015 appearance on Van Susteren’s "On the Record" show. "We have to reform the U.S. tax code if we want to create more economic growth and more jobs," said Ryan, who was chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee before becoming speaker. Ryan then dropped a stat that’s long been one of his key talking points, including when he was the GOP’s 2012 vice presidential candidate. "The tax rate on successful small businesses is 44.6 percent right now," Ryan said. "The tax rate on businesses in Canada is 15 percent. So we are taxing American businesses at a much higher rate than our foreign competitors are." He made a similar claim Nov. 15, 2015, during an interview on CBS News’ "60 Minutes." That seems like quite a gap. Is Ryan right? Digging into the numbers PolitiFact National looked into a version of this claim made during the 2012 vice presidential debate, when Ryan stated: "The Canadians — they (dropped) their tax rates to 15 percent. The average tax rate on businesses in the industrialized world is 25 percent." That claim was rated Mostly True. According to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, a group of advanced industrialized nations, Canada’s central government corporate rate has declined from 29.12 percent to 15 percent. Businesses in Canada, however, also pay provincial taxes. The combination of the central and provincial corporate tax rates has fallen from 42.94 percent to 26.1 percent. Using the same data for the 34 countries examined, the average 2012 tax rate was slightly under 25 percent. The tax claim that Ryan made on Fox News was somewhat different. He cited the business tax rate in Canada, and compared it with the U.S. tax rate on small businesses, which he put at 44.6 percent. To support the claim, Ryan’s office cited a 2013 report by the Ways and Means Committee, "Tax Revenues to More Than Double by 2023, While Top Tax Rates Hit Highest Level Since 1986." That report puts the federal tax rate for small businesses at 44.6 percent. So Ryan’s right on that number. As for the second part of the claim, Ryan’s office pointed us to Taxtips.ca, a Canadian tax and financial information service. Tables on that web site put the federal tax rate in Canada at 15 percent, which, again, is what Ryan cited. The group says that provincial tax rates for business range from 16 percent in Nova Scotia and Prince Edward Island to 10 percent in Alberta. Scott Hodge, president of the Washington D.C.-based Tax Foundation, agreed that Ryan had it right, based on his group’s data. If anything, Hodge said, Ryan understated the gap between the United States and Canada. Citing Canada’s Revenue Agency, Hodge said that Ryan compared U.S. small businesses with the general business rate in Canada. "The top federal tax rate for businesses is 15 percent. However, they do have a special small business rate of 11 percent," Hodge said in an email. "Mr. Ryan was obviously referring to the main rate, not the special small business rate. That would make the differences even starker." Our rating While arguing for tax reform, Ryan compared the difference in tax rates for small businesses in the United States with the general business tax rate in Canada. He was right on both numbers. Indeed, if he used the small business rate in Canada, the gap would be even larger. We rate his claim True.

pomt-07657	At Twin River, "we're more than competitive" with nearby casinos in slot machine payouts.	mostly true	/rhode-island/statements/2011/mar/13/patti-doyle/twin-rivers-spokeswoman-says-its-slot-machine-payo/	Earlier this month, Gov. Lincoln Chafee expressed the fear that trying to cull too much revenue from the state's slot parlors could send gamblers to other states, where the odds might be better. "They are not going to play if they are going to keep losing," Chafee said. "They'll go across the border, or go somewhere else where the odds, if you will, are more in their favor. … They know where they have a better chance of winning." In response, Patti Doyle, spokeswoman for Twin River, one of Rhode Island’s two slot parlors, said in a radio interview that her casino gives better odds. "We know from the industry standards in the industry casino world, that we're all pretty much on the same level. You know, you wouldn't be able to continue to be in business if you weren't competitive with gaming venues that are nearby. And we are. We're more than competitive," she said on radio station WPRO (630-AM). When we hear "more than competitive," we think "better." So we asked Doyle for the source of that comparison. While we awaited her response, we started our own research. On its website, RILot.com, the Rhode Island Lottery publishes a monthly list of how much cash was put into Twin River’s 4,700 slot machines, how much cash was won, and how much that represents in percentage. (It should be noted that neither Twin River, nor Newport Grand, the state’s other slot parlor, sets the payout percentages of their slot machines. They’re set by the director of the Rhode Island Lottery, Gerald S. Aubin.) Statistics for Connecticut's two casinos -- Foxwoods Resort Casino and Mohegan Sun -- are on the website of the Connecticut Division of Special Revenue at CT.gov/DOSR. At first glance, it looks like Rhode Island is less than competitive. During the period from January 2010 through January 2011, the highest monthly Twin River payout to gamblers was 91.529 percent, in December. The highest payout percentage at the Newport Grand, was lower: 91.171 percent in September. In contrast, the payouts at Foxwoods are listed as higher for 11 of the last 12 months. And Mohegan Sun offered a bigger payout every month, going no lower than 91.80 percent last May and as high as 92.17 in August. But George Papanier, CEO of Twin River, said the published percentages aren't comparable because states calculate the payout percentage differently. The issue is the credits that players get, also known as "free play." Rhode Island calls it Bonus Play. Mohegan lists it as eBonus Credits. In the Foxwoods report it's called Free Play. The two states account for it differently, said Papanier. Officials at the Rhode Island Lottery told us the same thing. As a result, the payout percentage for Foxwoods and Mohegan Sun is inflated, they said. In order to calculate the "Cash Won" at each Connecticut casino the same way it is calculated in Rhode Island, you must take the "handle " (the amount played, including free play and winnings replayed), subtract the "Win" amount (how much the casino wins) and subtract the value of the Free Play or eBonus coupons redeemed at the slot machines. By that formula, we discovered that, as Doyle said, Twin River’s payout percentage is better than Foxwoods’. In every month over the past year, Twin River had a higher payout percentage. The one-year averages: 91.366 percent for Twin River and 90.768 percent for Foxwoods. The story is a little different for Mohegan Sun. It beat out Twin River in 7 of the past 12 months, but the Connecticut casino's 12-month average was a hair below Twin River's, at 91.359 percent. A few tenths -- or hundredths -- of a percent may not seem consequential, but to serious gamblers, any tilt in their advantage is attractive, maybe even enough to send them to one casino over another. To double-check our numbers, we talked to Michael Janusko, chief financial examiner of Connecticut's Division of Special Revenue, who confirmed that our calculations were correct. The way Foxwoods and Mohegan Sun run their numbers, "it does overstate the payout percentage a bit," he said. Finally, Doyle sent us a copy of The Gaming Industry Observer's East Coast Slot Report that summarizes casino operations from Maine to Florida in January. Twin River ranked 13th out of 56 facilities in terms of money paid out to players, ahead of Mohegan Sun (25th), Newport Grand (26th), and Foxwoods (35th). Aubin, Rhode Island's Lottery director, said there is an important caveat to understand when considering payout. Those percentages are largely a function of the types of machines a casino has, not whether it is actually giving gamblers better odds. All other things being equal, a facility that has lots of penny slots, for example, will have a lower overall payout percentage than a casino that has none because those machines have smaller payouts. "I'm confident it would be the exact same payout throughout the country with the same game," he said. To summarize: Looking at the casinos as a whole, the way Foxwoods and Mohegan Sun calculate their payout percentages may make them look like a better bet for gamblers. But if you include player rewards to make an apples-to-apples comparison, Doyle's statement that Twin River is "more than competitive" is true for Foxwoods. Whether it applies to Mohegan Sun depends on the month. We rate her statement Mostly True.	None	Patti Doyle	None	None	None	2011-03-13T00:00:01	2011-03-02	['None']
pomt-06869	In contrast to President Barack Obama, who "is not acting presidential," President Ronald Reagan "would never go into the Oval Office without his jacket on — that's how much he revered the presidency."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/aug/01/ken-langone/wall-street-figure-ken-langone-blasts-obama-unpres/	Ken Langone, co-founder of Home Depot and a well-known Wall Street figure, took a shot at President Barack Obama during a July 28, 2011, roundtable segment on CNBC, the business-focused cable network. "Let me make it very clear, and I’m sure I’m going to get a lot of hate mail because of this, and that’s okay," Langone said. "I think our sitting president is acting so unpresidential …. He is dividing us as a nation. He is not bringing us together. He’s willfully dividing us. He’s petulant. ... "The reality is we believe in a government of three legs, all equal. So if (House Speaker John) Boehner and (Senate Majority Leader Harry) Reid -- well, Reid will do whatever (Obama) tells him -- if Boehner had said I am not coming unless you speak to me in a respectful way, I am third in line to the president, (then I won’t come). "Ronald Reagan would never go into the Oval Office without his jacket on — that's how much he revered the presidency. This guy (Obama) worked like hell to be president, okay? He’s got it. Behave like a president." Langone’s comment is heavily opinionated, and at PolitiFact we make it our policy not to fact-check opinions. However, Langone used a vivid example that we think is checkable -- namely, whether it’s true that Reagan "would never go into the Oval Office without his jacket on." As we look into that question, we’ll compare Reagan’s sartorial habits in the Oval Office with Obama’s to see whether Langone is justified in using Obama’s clothing choices to support his view that Obama is "not acting presidential." We began by contacting people who either worked in the Reagan White House or who covered it as journalists. Annelise Anderson said that neither she nor her husband Martin, both of whom worked in the Reagan White House, "ever saw Reagan in the Oval Office or the Roosevelt Room without a tie and jacket" and that they’d frequently heard that Reagan didn't even take his jacket off in the heat of summer. "Martin was in meetings with Reagan several times a day while he was assistant to the president for policy development," she said. "I was associate director of the Office of Management and Budget and saw the president less often, but always with coat and tie. Reagan's predecessor, Jimmy Carter, was far more casual." Andrea Mitchell, who covered the Reagan White House for NBC News and who now hosts MSNBC’s Andrea Mitchell Reports, said she agrees that "Reagan was more formal than some of his predecessors or successors. My recollection is that Reagan did usually wear his jacket in the Oval Office, as did many other presidents, at least when they were photographed. But there were clearly informal moments, especially on weekends and holidays when they didn’t have outside visitors." For documentary evidence, we turned to the Reagan Library in Simi Valley, Calif. We reached Steve Branch, an audiovisual archivist with the National Archives and Records Administration, who may know more than anyone else about the official White House photographs of the Reagan era. "We do have photos of President Reagan in the Oval Office without a coat and tie, but these only appear to be on weekends and I believe only for his Saturday radio addresses," Branch said. "During the regular work week, he always wore a coat and tie, which is evident from all the photos we have in our collection." As an example, Branch forwarded us contact sheets from two rolls of film that show Reagan in casual dress. Both were taken when Reagan came in to make a Saturday radio address. We found an additional image of a casual Reagan in the Oval Office in this slide show compiled by the Huffington Post. Mark Weinberg, an assistant press secretary in the Reagan White House, offered a simple explanation for why Reagan decided not to wear a jacket on weekends. "He did not want to make everyone coming into work feel like they had to dress up too," Weinberg said. "He knew that if he wore one, everyone else would, and he felt it was not fair to younger staff coming into work on weekends." So Langone is incorrect when he says that Reagan would "never go into the Oval Office without his jacket on." There’s photographic evidence showing Reagan jacket-less in the Oval Office, but there’s also ample evidence that Reagan usually wore jackets during the work week. What about Langone’s conclusion that Reagan’s dress habits in the White House stemmed from "how much he revered the presidency"? We heard, particularly from former Reagan aides, that the 40th president treated the office with reverence. "He made a point of saying the Oval Office was not his, that it belonged to the people, and he was only the custodian," Weinberg said. "I never, ever heard him refer to it as ‘my office.’" However, other experts see additional explanations for Reagan’s formality. One issue is the image-making that has shaped the modern presidency. Reagan, who polished his skills as an actor in Hollywood, has been widely hailed as a modern master of image-making. When Reagan was at his ranch in Santa Barbara, Calif., he tended to wear western garb. In Washington, he tended to dress more formally. Both styles complemented and reinforced each other, helping define a clear persona of someone who was robust and in charge. "Reagan understood that the image one projects helps shape the public’s view, and I suspect it is not just generational that a president who carries himself in a more formal, dignified manner projects by that a bit more gravitas than a president who dresses and acts like he’s just ‘one of the guys,’" said Sam Donaldson, who covered the Reagan White House for ABC News. To the extent that Obama has sometimes appeared without a jacket for Oval Office meetings, his decision communicates something different, said Bronwyn Cosgrave, the author of Sample: Cuttings from Contemporary Fashion and Costume & Fashion: A Complete History. Cosgrave said Obama in shirtsleeves "projects the sense that he is actually rolling up his sleeves, getting down to business and tackling the task of running the country," The other factor has to do with the norms for a man of Reagan’s generation. Lou Cannon, an author and journalist who covered Reagan both as California governor and as president, told PolitiFact that "Reagan certainly did revere the office of the presidency, but, in my view, the fact he wore a coat and tie to work is mostly generational. He did the same in Sacramento, at least on weekdays, when he was governor. People of my father's generation -- he was born seven years before Reagan -- were taught to wear a suit and tie for formal occasions and certainly would have done so in the White House." Fashion historians agreed that it’s important to keep in mind generational shifts. "The norms for dress have changed since the Reagan years to a much more casual attire," said Joanne B. Eicher, editor in chief of the Encyclopedia of World Dress and Fashion and an emeritus professor of design, housing, and apparel at the University of Minnesota. "This can even be seen in what people wear for air travel, as one example, then and now." Eicher said that "many men today do not wear complete suits or even jackets with trousers to social functions as once was expected. For example, a prominent business executive I know, about 60, was attending a late afternoon wedding reception last month wearing a well-pressed long-sleeved plaid shirt, with no tie. Times have changed a lot in regard to what is acceptable." We also tried to judge how often Obama has gone jacket-less in the Oval Office. We did this by looking at the White House Flickr stream, which includes photographs taken by the official White House photographers. We found that in the great majority of Oval Office photographs during his presidency, Obama was seen wearing a suit. We did find that Obama was likelier to be jacket-less during his first 100 days in office, with 13 instances during that period. However, in the 26 months since then, Obama has sharply curtailed the number of times he has been caught on camera in the Oval Office without a jacket. We found only eight examples on weekdays during that period, or about one such occasion every three months. (We found two additional cases after the first 100 days when Obama went casual on a weekend or holiday.) We also noted that none of these eight occasions included an outsider. All showed Obama either by himself or with top aides or cabinet members. Eicher, the fashion historian, added that even when jacket-less, Obama's choice of shirts and ties is "immaculate." Most people who we interviewed for this story thought Langone had gone too far in demonizing Obama. "Reagan was a transformational president, but I don't really think the fact he wore a coat and tie to the Oval Office had anything to do with it," said Cannon, the Reagan biographer. "And while I have my criticisms of President Obama, the notion that ‘his behavior’ means ‘the end of America as we know it’ is rot. Obama dresses appropriately for the present generation, as Reagan did for his." Bruce Bartlett, an economist who worked in the Reagan White House, agreed that "Reagan was certainly more formal than Carter, but probably no more so than Nixon or Ford had been. I don’t have the impression that Obama is any different than most presidents in that regard. In any case, it is idiotic to say that he would be debasing the presidency by not wearing a jacket." So where does this leave us? Langone isn’t correct that Reagan "would never go into the Oval Office without his jacket on," since he did dress casually on weekend days. But it is true that Reagan consistently wore a jacket on weekdays. That’s a stricter standard than Obama has set, though the differences between the two presidents aren’t as divergent as Langone suggests. In addition, most people we interviewed thought that he went too far when he used Obama’s patterns of dress as evidence that he is "unpresidential." Since the end of Obama’s first 100 days, Obama has been photographed without a jacket in the Oval Office only about once every three months and never with a visitor who wasn’t a senior staff member or appointee. The vast majority of photographs show Obama dressed in a jacket in the Oval Office, even though fashion experts agreed that generational norms have shifted, making jackets less essential, and less expected, in such settings. It's clear that Reagan's customary dress -- relaxed only on weekends -- was a suit and tie. But Langone's use of the word "never" overstated the case. In our rulings, words matter. So we rate Langone’s statement Mostly False.	None	Ken Langone	None	None	None	2011-08-01T16:48:03	2011-07-28	['Ronald_Reagan', 'Barack_Obama', 'Oval_Office']
pomt-09217	California gubernatorial candidate Steve Poizner, a Republican, "gave $10,000 to Al Gore's recount" effort in 2000.	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/may/18/meg-whitman/california-race-whitman-says-poizner-donated-gore-/	The Republican primary to succeed Arnold Schwarzenegger (R) as governor of California has spawned a flood of ads attacking both Meg Whitman, the former CEO of eBay, and Steve Poizner, the state insurance commissioner -- the two frontrunners for the nomination. One ad, aired by Whitman beginning in midMay, attacks Poizner's fitness to be the Republican nominee in part by charging that he gave $10,000 to the 2000 presidential recount effort of Al Gore and Joe Lieberman, the Democratic nominees for president and vice president. The ad asks, "How liberal is Steve Poizner?" then answers its own question by proposing a litany of evidence, including the charge that Poizner "gave $10,000 to Al Gore's recount." The Poizner camp concedes that a federal disclosure form does indeed show that the Gore account received a $10,000 check signed by Poizner, whom the federal form identifies as an employee of the high-tech company Qualcomm. Qualcomm had earlier purchased Poizner's Silicon Vallley startup, SnapTrack Inc. Technically, the donation was made to a Democratic National Committee affiliate, but the campaign did not challenge the ad's description of the donation as being intended for the recount. However, the Poizner campaign has consistently argued that the check (as well as a separate $1,000 check made out to Gore 2000 Inc.) was written on a joint account and actually was intended to be a donation from his wife, Carol Poizner. "As Steve has made clear numerous times over the last 10 years, his wife is a Democrat," Poizner campaign press secretary Bettina Inclán told PolitiFact. "Steve’s wife supported Al Gore and contributions were made through their joint checking account. Steve voted for President Bush in 2000, worked for President Bush, and voted for President Bush again in 2004." We wondered whether this explanation might be credible, so we checked in (no pun intended) with some campaign-finance experts. Sean Parnell, president of the Center for Competitive Politics, a campaign-finance advocacy group, and Brett Kappel, a campaign-finance and ethics counsel at the Washington, D.C., law firm Arent Fox, both agreed that it's possible that it could have happened as the campaign says it did. "It's true that Federal Election Commission regulations do require that campaigns attribute checks drawn on a joint checking account to the last person who signs the check, and (the Poizners) should have specified that the check was coming from her either by making a notation on the check or in an accompanying letter," Kappel said. "But did you ever write a check for something your wife wanted? I have." At the same time, Kappel added that it's fair to fault Poizner for acting sloppily if he did that, since people with political ambitions tend to be very careful about such matters. In addition, the forms for both donations list Steve Poizner's employer -- Qualcomm in one case and SnapTrack in the other. This suggests that either Poizner filed a supplementary form explaining the donation (a step that's recommended but not required under federal campaign finance law) or that staffers for Gore looked into the donation and had a reason to attribute the donation to him, as opposed to his wife, when they filed the disclosure form. It's worth noting that Whitman -- a fellow Silicon Valley business titan -- has also fielded accusations from the Poizner camp about her own past partisan lapses. We are separately fact-checking the claim that Whitman "contributed to, and campaigned, for Barbara Boxer," California's liberal Democratic senator. It also bears mentioning that, for someone the campaign describes as still being "a Democrat," Carol Poizner has donated an awful lot of money to the GOP. Ever since she gave $2,000 to Sen. John Kerry, D-Mass., in 2001, she has, in her own name, donated almost $90,000 to such recipients as the presidential campaign of Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., the Republican National Committee and the California Republican Party. Ultimately, there is no way to prove with any certainty whether Steve Poizner was simply writing a check for his wife, as he suggests. Experts tell us it could have happened that way. But under the law, the fact that he signed the check officially makes the donation his, and the listing of his employer, rather than his wife's, on the disclosure form provides additional evidence that he was the intended donor. So while the case isn't conclusive, its strongly suggestive. We rate the Whitman campaign's claim Mostly True.

pomt-03599	In Cranston, it costs $5,000 to $6,000 to send out community notifications on just one Level 3 sex offender.	false	/rhode-island/statements/2013/may/12/peter-palumbo/ri-state-rep-peter-palumbo-says-it-costs-5000-6000/	Rhode Island state law requires officials to notify neighbors when dangerous sex offenders move into their community. Under a bill proposed by the attorney general’s office, the responsibility for making those notifications would move from cities and towns to the state. During an April 11 hearing on the proposal, House bill 5557, there was discussion of the current cost. (We've written about one such statement by Special Assistant Attorney General Joee Lindbeck in a separate item.) Rep. Peter Palumbo, D-Cranston, the bill's chief sponsor, said the change would save money for municipal government because their notification costs would disappear. "I know [in] the city of Cranston it's somewhere between $5,000 and $6,000, I believe, per Level 3 registered offender," he said. "That's what it's costing now to notify the people in the neighborhoods if we have a Level 3 sex offender in there." Level 3 offenders are regarded as most likely to get into trouble again. The state's website listing sex offenders shows 52 Level 3 offenders registered in Cranston. If Palumbo’s claim were true, the city must be spending a lot of money on notifications. (That doesn't mean authorities had to make 52 notifications. Police only have to warn residents, schools, community organizations and other groups when an offender moves into the area.) When we checked Palumbo’s figures with the attorney general's office, it listed Cranston as having spent just $9,137 for 2011. That would be barely enough for two Level 3 notifications if his numbers were correct. So we went to Cranston Police Chief Marco Palombo to try to reconcile the numbers. The chief sent us a detailed accounting. In 2011, the department sent out notifications for seven Level 2 and four Level 3 sex offenders at a total cost of $7,203. (The chief said the $9,137 figure included registration costs.) Based on the accounting, that averages out to $655 per offender. The costs were similar whether the offender was designated Level 2 or Level 3. So when Representative Palumbo said that it cost between $5,000 and $6,000 to notify people that a registered Level 3 sex offender has moved into a Cranston neighborhood, his estimate was about eight times too high. We rate the claim False. (If you have a claim you’d like PolitiFact Rhode Island to check, e-mail us at politifact@providencejournal.com. And follow us on Twitter: @politifactri.)

pomt-09944	"President Obama will now own 60 percent of GM, and his union buddies will own almost 20 percent."	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/jun/01/michael-steele/rnc-chairman-michael-steele-claims-government-will/	Shortly after General Motors filed for bankruptcy, a plan that will involve significant government ownership of the auto company, Republicans went into attack mode. The General Motors restructuring plan "is nothing more than another government grab of a private company and another handout to the union cronies who helped bankroll his presidential campaign," said Republican National Committee chairman Michael Steele in a statement accompanying a newly minted ad. "President Obama will now own 60 percent of GM, and his union buddies will own almost 20 percent. And what do the taxpayers get? They’ll get stuck with up to a $50 billion tab for the taxpayer dollars Obama is using to pay for his takeover of GM." In its bankruptcy filing, the company said it has $172.81 billion in debt and $82.29 billion in assets — all that despite a $20 billion General Motors has already received from the government, money that was initially earmarked for buying bad mortgages from banks. Now, the company will adopt a restructuring plan that is "tailored to the realities of today's auto market," said Obama. It's "a plan that positions GM to move toward profitability, even if it takes longer than expected for our economy to fully recover; and it's a plan that builds on GM's recent progress in making better cars." So, there's no dispute that the government is invested in General Motors — it has already shelled out $20 billion in loans — but is Steele correct about the government's new financial ties to the ailing company? We assume that by referring to President Obama owning 60 percent of the automaker, Steele means that the government as a whole will own that stake under the restructuring plan. In fact, the White House was the first to state this fact, during a May 31 briefing with reporters. By the administration's own words, the RNC is correct on this point. Steele goes on to say that Obama's "union buddies will own almost 20 percent." To be exact, the United Auto Workers will get 17.5 percent of General Motor's common stock, plus cash to help pay for a $20 billion health care trust fund for retirees. Whether this is a boon to Obama's "union buddies," as Steele's statement says, is a matter of opinion. However, it's worth noting that the UAW endorsed Obama for president and spent more than $4 million to assist his candidacy, according to the Center for Responsive Politics. So Steele is right that the administration will have a 60 percent ownership in the new General Motors and that the union will have nearly 20 percent. Steele earns a True.

pomt-06178	Since Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker took office, "we are losing jobs at rates not seen in decades."	false	/wisconsin/statements/2011/dec/14/kathleen-falk/potential-recall-candidate-kathleen-falk-says-job-/	Adversaries of Republican Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker pound him each time there’s news of job losses in the state. Perhaps they feel baited by his campaign promise (tracked by our Walk-O-Meter) to create 250,000 private-sector jobs during his four-year term. But Democrat Kathleen Falk-- a potential challenger to Walker should he face a recall election in 2012 -- went further in her criticism. In a Dec. 6, 2011 opinion article for the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, the former Dane County executive and 2002 gubernatorial candidate accused Walker of not telling the truth about what he would do as governor. She also included a series of other jabs, including one on job losses. "He said he is focused on creating jobs, but since Walker took office, we are losing jobs at rates not seen in decades," Falk wrote, "and his own administration recently admitted that he won't fulfill his promise to create 250,000 new jobs." The state Department of Revenue did project in October 2011 that Walker will fall short of the 250,000 mark, though the governor himself has not abandoned the goal. But that report also noted that jobs are up in 2011. So is it possible, as Falk claims, that Wisconsin is losing jobs at rates not seen since at least the 1990s? Falk’s evidence When we asked Falk spokeswoman Melissa Mulliken for evidence, she cited two Journal Sentinel news articles. She highlighted the first sentence of an article about job losses in September 2011: "Wisconsin shed private-sector jobs for the third consecutive month in September, while employment at government agencies and public schools registered its deepest drop in decades." The article went on to say that the loss of an estimated 11,500 jobs among city, county, state and public school employees was the "deepest single-month decline since at least 1990." (The figure has since been revised to 10,200, according to the state Department of Workforce Development, which produces the state’s monthly employment reports. That is still the largest monthly loss of public-sector jobs since at least 1990.) But Falk claimed "we are losing jobs at rates not seen in decades," without any qualification or explanation. We think to the average reader that means jobs overall -- not merely public-sector jobs-- especially since it was in the context of Walker’s 250,000-jobs pledge. Mulliken also cited an article about October 2011 job losses, which are the most recent figures available. The article said October marked the state’s fourth consecutive month of job declines -- but it said nothing about the losses being the worst in decades. Other evidence Let’s review Walker’s record on jobs during his first 10 months in office. As we’ve reported on the Walk-O-Meter, the state has added a net 20,100 private-sector jobs in 2011 through October. (The November numbers are due out Dec. 15). But as noted, public-sector jobs have dropped under Walker, so let’s get the full picture. Overall figures show the state gained jobs during each of the first six months of 2011 and lost jobs during each of the next four months. The net result? A total of 11,200 jobs have been added under Walker. That would seem to shoot down Falk’s claim. But let’s look even more closely. If you highlight the four months in 2011 where there were losses -- July through October -- the state lost 27,600 jobs, including more than 10,000 in September alone. Are either of those figures the highest in decades? No. Under Democratic Gov. Jim Doyle in 2009 -- when the state suffered a net loss of 121,000 jobs -- 84,700 jobs were lost during the first four months of the year, including 24,700 in April alone. Our conclusion Falk said that despite Walker’s claim to being focused on job creation, since he took office in January 2011, "we are losing jobs at rates not seen in decades" -- suggesting that job losses overall are the highest in decades. But the evidence she provided cites only public-sector jobs. Overall, the state has seen a net gain in jobs since Walker took office. And in the months when jobs have declined under Walker, we have to go back only two years to find job losses at a greater rate. We rate Falk’s statement False.

pomt-11343	"Today, we (in Pennsylvania) have higher unemployment and lower job growth than most."	mostly true	/pennsylvania/statements/2018/apr/09/paul-mango/paul-mangos-dire-economic-portrait-pennsylvania-mo/	In his primary bid for Pennsylvania governor, Pittsburgh-area businessman and Republican candidate Paul Mango says the Commonwealth’s economy is stalled and lagging behind those in most states across the country. "Today, we have higher unemployment and lower job growth than most," Mango says in a three-minute-long online campaign video that was released in May 2017. Mango is one of three Republicans running in next month’s primary. Incumbent Gov. Tom Wolf will be on the November ballot. While it’s accurate that Pennsylvania’s economy has not rebounded as quickly as some following the Great Recession, is it true that its unemployment is higher and job growth "lower than most"? Unemployment Mango’s campaign video was released in May 2017, the same month he formally declared his candidacy for governor. At the time the ad was released, Pennsylvania’s seasonally adjusted unemployment rate was 4.8 percent and higher than the rates in roughly 40 other states, according to data published by the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The national unemployment rate in May of 2017 was 4.3 percent. The same holds true today. Per Bureau of Labor Statistics data for Feb. 2018, Pennsylvania’s unemployment rate remained at 4.8 percent and higher than the unemployment rates of roughly 44 other states. The national rate was 4.1 percent last month. Job growth That brings us to the subject of job growth in Pennsylvania. It’s true that the Commonwealth’s economy did not rebound as quickly as some others following the Great Recession. But Antony Davies, an associate economics professor in Duquesne University’s Palumbo Donahue School of Business, said it’s also worth noting that Pennsylvania didn’t suffer as badly as many states during the recession, and therefore didn’t have as far to go in climbing out. "In 2009, unemployment nationwide was around 10 percent," Davies said by phone. "In Pennsylvania at that same time, it was around 8.4 or 8.5. We haven't improved as much as the rest of the country, but we didn’t start off as bad either." In his ad, Mango cites a 2016Philly.comarticle for his claim that Pennsylvania’s job growth remains unusually sluggish. That article says Pennsylvania job growth "has not been sufficient to keep up with the growth in the labor force." Matt Beynon, a spokesman for Mango’s campaign, said the campaign relied on news reports but also substantiated the claim with source data put out by the Bureau of Labor Statistics. "Using either total employment or non-farm employment, Pennsylvania is in the bottom half of all the states when it comes to job growth during the Wolf administration from Jan 2015-February 2018," Beynon said by email. "Additionally, it is also true that total employment in Pennsylvania has dropped each month now over the last ten months, as Pennsylvania’s economy continues to fall further behind other states." Frank Gamrat, a senior research associate with the Allegheny Institute for Public Policy, a Pittsburgh-based conservative think tank, said Pennsylvania actually hasn't had a decrease to its private jobs count since May of 2010 but showed slower private employment gains than the nation did as a whole between 2016 and 2017. (Again, Mango’s ad was released in May of 2017.) And jobs continue to be added here. In February, the Current Employment Statistics (CES) monthly payroll survey reported 10,400 jobs were added in Pennsylvania and ranks that ahead of 37 other states and the District of Columbia. These same figures were cited in a release from the office of U.S. Senator Martin Heinrich, a Democrat from New Mexico and ranking member of the Senate’s Joint Economic Committee, which said Pennsylvania added 82,800 public and private sector jobs since February of last year, more than 43 other states in that time. Additionally, the Economic Policy Institute in March reported that the number of jobs added in Pennsylvania in the last 12 months is on par with the growth seen in most other states. Our ruling Mango is right that Pennsylvania’s unemployment rate remains higher than the rates of most other states, according to federal data. It’s also true that Pennsylvania job growth has generally lagged behind the national rate — although that appears to be correcting some. But his claim that Pennsylvania has lower job growth "than most" gives the impression that most states are seeing stronger job creation. The national rate and individual state rates are not the same thing. The national rate is skewed by states like California with larger populations and larger workforces than most, Davies said. It’s also important to note that some states with greater post-recession job growth suffered greater recession-era job losses than Pennsylvania, as Davies also pointed out. We rate this claim Mostly True.	None	Paul Mango	None	None	None	2018-04-09T06:00:00	2017-05-07	['Pennsylvania']
pomt-11528	Says he has a plan for "$1 billion in tax relief for Illinois."	mostly false	/illinois/statements/2018/feb/16/bruce-rauner/does-gov-rauner-truly-have-1-billion-tax-relief-pl/	The day after unveiling a new budget blueprint for the coming fiscal year, Gov. Bruce Rauner followed that up with a televised campaign ad that portrays the re-election seeking incumbent as "leading the charge" to cut taxes for working people in Illinois. The Rauner ad takes aim at Democratic House Speaker Mike Madigan, the governor’s frequent nemesis, who gets blamed for imposing a $5 billion tax increase last summer over Rauner’s objection. At 14 seconds, the spot says: "Bruce Rauner vetoed the Madigan income tax increase, and now Rauner’s leading the charge to reverse it. The Rauner plan: More take-home pay for working families, lower taxes for job creators and $1 billion in tax relief for Illinois." Rauner didn’t actually include that tax cut in his spending plan, which ironically relies on the revenue bump from the very tax increase he assails. But he did argue in his speech to lawmakers that an overhaul to state pensions could be used to fund a "nearly $1 billion tax cut." Though Rauner rounded up, the value of the proposed tax cut is noted in the governor’s budget book as $917 million. At the same time, however, the Rauner budget did anticipate separate cost saving initiatives which, if realized, would over several years shift responsibility for more than $1 billion in expenses for teacher pensions off the state books and on to local property taxpayers. Given all that, can Rauner really lay claim as he does in his ad to having a plan for $1 billion in tax relief? We decided to take a look. Election year wish list versus realpolitik Rauner’s previous budgets have been laden with fiscal gimmicks, leading PolitiFact to twice award the governor its lowest Pants-on-Fire! credibility rating for claiming they were balanced. His latest offering appears constructed with more care. Not present, for example, was the major asterisk he slipped into his 2017 budget which attributed more than $4 billion in savings to a legislative compromise that had not been hammered out and never was. That said, the latest budget offering and tax-cut plan from Rauner has its share of difficult-to-achieve contingencies and faces challenges both in the Legislature and likely the courts as well. First, Rauner would need the Legislature to pass a pension-reform bill that upends the current formula for calculating future benefits. The governor didn’t put forward a specific proposal but he said the idea is based on a model that makes employees choose between annual salary increases and cost of living increases to pension benefits. What’s more, just months after Rauner took office in 2015 the Illinois Supreme Court unanimously struck down a sweeping pension reform plan approved two years earlier. The court found that the state Constitution says retirement benefits, once offered to public workers, can not be "diminished or impaired." At the same time, however, the court hinted that it might be possible to change the structure of pension benefits as long as employees got something of equal value in return. The concept has never been legally tested. So even if lawmakers and the governor agreed on a pension-reform fix, it almost certainly would face a court challenge with an uncertain outcome. The idea that the very difficult pension reform would be ironed out in the coming months leaves critics skeptical of Rauner’s plan. On top of that, the governor would have to convince the Democratic-controlled Legislature to then partly reverse the income tax increase it passed, with some Republican votes, last year. "It needs legislative approval on the front end and back end and a Constitutional review in the middle — other than that it’s golden," said Ralph Martire, executive director of the Center for Tax and Budget Accountability, a Chicago-based think tank partly funded by labor unions. Rauner’s campaign staff did not respond to questions from the BGA about the governor’s tax cut claim. Also left hanging were questions about the pension spending shift which over time could force local schools to seek significant property tax hikes. Separately, the governor’s office did issue this statement: "We don’t need pension reform to balance the budget, but if we can take that extra step we can put nearly $1 billion back in taxpayers’ pockets and begin to roll back the tax hike with a 1.4 percent tax rate cut. We look forward to working together with legislators on both sides of the aisle to pass these vital reforms and get Illinois moving in the right direction." Our ruling Rauner says he has a plan for "$1 billion in tax relief for Illinois" tied to a pension overhaul. But that statement is suspect on multiple levels — even for a campaign commercial. There is no actual plan to examine. The "plan" consists of brief mentions in a more than 550-page budget proposal and a few lines in a speech, but no details were provided to explain how the savings would be implemented or calculated. However, the tax cut was then featured prominently in a re-election campaign ad the day after Rauner unveiled his budget. What’s more, Rauner’s budget does include separate provisions to shift teacher pension costs off the state books and on to local school districts where property taxpayers would likely have to collectively pick up a tab costing more than $1 billion. Rauner’s ad highlights a vague $1 billion tax cut plan, but makes no mention of the added expense to local taxpayers that would be the practical effect of his pension cost shift. His tax cut claim should not be considered in a vacuum, which is why we rate it Mostly False.	None	Bruce Rauner	None	None	None	2018-02-16T07:00:00	2018-02-15	['Illinois']
pomt-00873	Medicaid is close to 30 percent of the state budget and "the biggest expenditure at the state."	mostly true	/florida/statements/2015/mar/12/florida-chamber-commerce/florida-considers-medicaid-expansion-chamber-makes/	After rejecting Medicaid expansion in 2013, the Florida Legislature is taking a serious look at it this session. The program pays for health insurance for the very poor. On March 10, a state Senate panel approved a proposal that would allow Florida to accept $50 billion in federal dollars to expand coverage to about 800,000 low-income residents. The plan would establish a state-run private insurance exchange for residents who earn less than $16,000 a year or $33,000 for a family of four. Though the bill won unanimous support of the GOP-dominated Senate Health Policy Committee, it faces an uphill battle in the more conservative House. Also, it would require the federal government to grant Florida a waiver. The feds might object to parts of the Senate proposal that require beneficiaries to pay a monthly premium based on their salary, ranging from $3 to $25. During the Senate hearing, the Florida Chamber of Commerce President and CEO Mark Wilson said he had met with legislators to discuss the chamber’s ideas for a Medicaid proposal. "We recommended a 32 percent cap on state expenditures, we are coming close to 30 percent right now," he said. "It's the biggest expenditure at the state and we’d like to protect taxpayers with a 32 percent cap." Does Medicaid come close to eating up nearly one-third of the state budget and is it the state’s biggest expenditure? Medicaid and the state budget Medicaid is a joint state and federal program aimed at providing health insurance to the very poor. The 2010 Affordable Care Act encourages states to expand eligibility and agreed to pay 100 percent of the expansion for the first three years, declining to 90 percent in 2020 and beyond. Twenty nine states adopted the expansion -- six including Florida are considering it, according to the Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation. Republican Gov. Rick Scott initially opposed Medicaid expansion but switched his position in 2013 when he came out in support of it. But Scott didn’t lobby the GOP-led Legislature, which ultimately rejected the expansion. In 2014, Democratic challenger Charlie Crist attacked Scott for not pushing for it and argued it would have led to increased jobs in Florida. Edie Ousley, a spokeswoman for the chamber, sent PolitiFact Florida state budget documents, as well as information from groups such as Florida TaxWatch, to show how much of the budget is devoted to Medicaid. We also examined documents we received from the Florida Office of Economic and Demographic Research. The original 2014-15 Medicaid appropriation was $23.6 billion from all state and federal funds. The total budget for all funds was about $77.08 billion, which means that Medicaid accounts for about 30.6 percent of the budget. On March 4, the state released its latest revision for how much is needed for Medicaid this year and concluded it was $23.52 billion -- about 55 percent is federal dollars and 45 percent is state money. "For all funds, Medicaid is the largest program," Amy Baker, the state’s chief economist, told PolitiFact Florida. But education programs -- including K-12 and higher education -- have received on average slightly more than 52 percent of all state general revenue appropriations since 1997-98. The second-largest policy area is human services. "Over this same period, the human services portion of the budget has grown from 25 percent to nearly 30 percent, primarily because of the state’s Medicaid program growth," Baker said. Nationwide, Medicaid accounts for about 20 percent of state general fund appropriations while K-12 accounts for about one-third, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. Medicaid eats up such a large chunk of the budget due to rising health care costs and growing caseloads -- and it continues to grow at a faster rate than education spending, said Arturo Perez, fiscal affairs director for the NCSL. The National Association of State Budget Officers found that if they combined state and federal spending, on average about 26 percent of states’ budgets were for Medicaid in 2014. When combining those federal and state dollars, "there is no question it is the biggest chunk of the budget in total -- no question," said Kurt Wenner, of Florida TaxWatch. George Washington University health policy professor Leighton Ku said that as far as state-based fiscal burdens, a better measure is to focus on how much of the state general fund goes to Medicaid. That level is about 20 percent of state general fund expenditures, he said. "The general fund corresponds better to what state taxpayers contribute and takes out stuff like federal revenue. Still a lot, but much lower than 31 percent. Nonetheless, there is no doubt that Medicaid is a large component of state budgets, so there is reason for legislators to be concerned about the costs." But the majority of Medicaid costs that are paid by the federal government are not a burden to state taxpayers, but essentially an influx of federal funds to the state that promotes economic growth in the state, Ku said. "Thus, the actual ‘burden’ to state taxpayers is far less than 30 percent of their state tax dollars," he said. "In terms of state/local expenditures, education costs are always much higher." Our ruling Medicaid is close to 30 percent of the state budget and "the biggest expenditure at the state," Wilson said. There are two ways to look at Medicaid spending. The 30 percent figure is correct if Wilson counts both the state and federal dollars that go toward Medicaid, and it is the biggest expendituree. However, if we only count state dollars, then education eats up a bigger piece of the budget. It's important to understand that the federal government contributes to Medicaid, so the statement is accurate but needs additional information. We rate this claim Mostly True.

pomt-00380	"We saw the true danger of the FCC's net neutrality repeal when Verizon was caught throttling California fire fighters."	half-true	/punditfact/statements/2018/sep/07/fight-future/could-net-neutrality-have-shielded-california-fire/	The idea that greedy corporations would screw over the average Internet user was perhaps the most vocal concern raised last year when a bundle of Internet protections, known as net neutrality, went on the chopping block. Now, three months after the regulations officially died, proponents are staking out a very different position as they work to resurrect the rules. Net neutrality must be restored, they argue, because its repeal has jeopardized public safety. "We saw the true danger of the FCC's net neutrality repeal when Verizon was caught throttling California firefighters," said digital rights group Fight for the Future. Let’s unpack that statement, starting with the California fire. Using tech to fight fires Golden State firefighters are still working to contain the largest blaze in state history. The Mendocino Complex Fire began burning in Northern California in late July, and so far has torched over 726,000 acres — more than double the size of Los Angeles. Firefighters from around the state have been called to action. Among the out-of-town responders were firefighters from Santa Clara County, located in the center of Silicon Valley, about 160 miles south of the inferno. The Santa Clara County fire department deployed a high-tech truck, known in firefighter jargon as an "Incident Support Unit," to serve as a command-and-control center. To work effectively, the trucks need a robust Internet signal. Its broadband hookup is used to power software like Google Sheets, which lets firefighters coordinate real-time responses. But in the midst of battling the largest fire in California history, the Santa Clara County truck’s Internet speed suddenly slowed to a crawl. At roughly 1/200 the original speed, firefighters would have been no worse off using a dial-up modem from the 1990s. So what the heck was happening? "(We) discovered the data connection was being throttled by Verizon," Fire Chief Anthony Bowden said in a statement filed as part of an ongoing lawsuit against the FCC. "These reduced speeds severely interfered with the unit’s ability to function effectively. "Even small delays in response translate into devastating effects," he added, "including loss of property, and, in some cases, loss of life." The throttling persisted for some time even after the firefighters complained to Verizon and told the company of their urgent need to have fast Internet restored. Verizon later apologized for the incident. The restrictions were in place because the firefighters had a contract that said excess data usage was subject to significantly slowed-down speeds. But the company said it failed to comply with its own internal policy of taking its foot off the brake during emergencies. "In supporting first responders in the Mendocino fire, we didn’t live up to our own promise of service and performance excellence when our process failed some first responders on the line, battling a massive California wildfire," Verizon said in a statement. "For that, we are truly sorry." The public relations fiasco drove Verizon to vow not to throttle west coast firefighters and some other first responders. But that olive branch had limited reach. For some, the incident was the most clear-cut demonstration of the shortcomings of industry self-policing in the post-net neutrality era. Instead of after-the-fact corporate damage control, they argue, what’s needed is to put the law back on the books. What is net neutrality anyways? So would Verizon’s conduct have been unlawful and punishable under net neutrality? That’s the main thrust of Fight for the Future’s statement. For the purposes of this fact-check, you need to bear in mind a couple of net neutrality’s key features. (See a more detailed explainer here.) A core idea behind net neutrality is that virtually all content will travel unimpeded around the same speed. "Usually, when one thinks of a net neutrality violation, one thinks of the violation of the no blocking, no throttling, and no paid prioritization rules," said Blair Levin, who served as chief of staff to the FCC chairman from 1993 through 1997. Of those three rules, we’re concerned here with only one: the ban on throttling. That rule generally prohibited Internet service providers, or ISPs, from slowing down customers’ speeds. However, to give ISPs flexibility in designing service plans that would avoid network congestion, the FCC carved out an exception. ISPs could offer plans that would allow willing customers to be throttled if they exceeded their data cap. In a sense, by signing this type of contract, customers waived their right not to be throttled. In addition to the no-throttling rule, you also need to know about net neutrality’s "general conduct" rule. That rule stopped companies like Verizon and Comcast from "unreasonably interfering" with customers’ Internet access. It also created an avenue for customers file complaints to the FCC, which could trigger an investigation into an ISP’s practices. One way to think about net neutrality with respect to ISPs is that it gave the FCC teeth. Net neutrality’s repeal, in turn, largely defanged it. So would the FCC have taken a bite out of Verizon if the old rules were still in play? The no-throttling rule The contract between Verizon and the California firefighters allowed throttling for excessive data use. In other words, the firefighters waived their right not to be throttled over their limit. Under the $37.99-per-month plan, the department would get high-speed broadband for the first 25 gigabytes. Data use beyond that was subject to speed reductions. The device installed in the California firefighter’s high-tech truck can use up to 5-10 gigabytes per day. At that rate, the firefighters quickly hit their cap. To some experts, the incident was simply the culmination of a series of mistakes — not a poster child for stronger regulation. "What really happened wasn’t a net neutrality issue," Berin Szoka, a tech lawyer and president of the group TechFreedom, wrote. "The (fire department) simply chose a data plan for their mobile command and control unit that was manifestly inappropriate for their needs." What’s clear is that because the firefighters’ service plan permitted the kind of speed restrictions that were allowed under the old rules, Verizon did not directly violate net neutrality’s no-throttling rule. "The throttling incident, while a real PR disaster for Verizon, has nothing to do with net neutrality," said Doug Brake, the director of broadband and spectrum policy at the Information Technology & Innovation Foundation. "The rules explicitly allowed for data plans that rate-limit or ‘throttle’ a data connection after a certain threshold." A spokeswoman for the Republican-majority FCC pointed out that the Santa Clara County fire department, which is party to a lawsuit against the FCC to restore net neutrality, does not argue the no-throttling rule was violated here. "What happened had nothing to do with net neutrality," she said. "Verizon was not discriminating on the basis of content, application, service or device." Even the group behind the claim we’re checking, Fight for the Future, conceded the narrow point about the contract falling under the no-throttling exception. Evan Greer, Fight for the Future’s deputy director, told us, "Verizon's throttling of firefighters was not a direct violation of the ‘no throttling’ rule since it related to a data cap." The ‘general conduct’ rule But there’s another rule that could have ensnared Verizon: The "general conduct" rule. This prohibited companies like Verizon and Comcast from "unreasonably interfering" with customers’ Internet access. It also created an avenue for customers to file complaints to the FCC. But the repeal of net neutrality choked off this avenue. "Under the 2015 rules, the firefighters could have filed a complaint with the FCC on grounds that the throttling was ‘unjust and unreasonable,’ " said Chip Stewart, a communication technology expert and professor at Texas Christian University. "After the current FCC repealed those rules, that is no longer an option." Gigi Sohn, who was a counselor to the FCC chairman while the net neutrality rules were written, said she believes the firefighters "could have made a persuasive case" if that option were available today. "The throttling of the Santa Clara County FPD’s broadband service was a disaster waiting to happen," Sohn wrote in an essay for NBC News. "In the absence of net neutrality rules and without strong FCC oversight, broadband providers like Verizon, Comcast and AT&T are free to run their networks as they please without regard to consumers, competition or public safety." Harold Feld, the senior vice president at the liberal Public Knowledge, said the key point comes down to whether or not there’s a process for aggrieved consumers to get a fair hearing. "It’s not just about whether Verizon behaved appropriately or not," he told PolitiFact, citing a blog post he wrote. "It’s about having clear rules and procedures in place so that when an emergency like this happens, people know what to do and can resolve the problem quickly." Some tech experts say additional oversight is unnecessary because companies are capable of policing themselves. (Verizon has promised to do so with more verve in the future, for instance.) But not all agree. "The removal of the 'cop on the beat' may have contributed to Verizon acting in ways that even it now admits was dumb," Levin said. "If there is no one watching, people act differently than if they think someone is watching." Our ruling Fight for the Future said, "We saw the true danger of the FCC's net neutrality repeal when Verizon was caught throttling California fire fighters." Under net neutrality, the firefighters could have filed a complaint against Verizon to the FCC, which at the very least would have launched an investigation, experts said. Repeal of the rules removed that avenue, thereby sidelining the FCC from serving as a "cop on the beat." However, the firefighters’ service plan permitted the kind of speed restrictions that were allowed under the old rules. So the company did not violate net neutrality’s no-throttling rule. The claim is partially accurate but leaves out important context. We rate this Half True.

pomt-03086	"I’ve been reducing the number of Democratic" Texas Senate committee "chairs since I came in" as lieutenant governor.	mostly false	/texas/statements/2013/sep/26/david-dewhurst/dewhurst-both-decreased-and-increased-texas-senate/	Lt. Gov. David Dewhurst talked up his toughness on Democrats during a Republican lieutenant governor candidate forum in Houston. Dewhurst, who presides over the 31-member Texas Senate, zeroed in on the topic in response to a question about what each candidate might have done differently to speed along anti-abortion legislation in 2013. Senate Democrats, helped by hollering spectators, kept the Republican-sought restrictions from surviving in one summer special session, though they subsequently passed into law. Dewhurst, speaking after another candidate pooh-poohed the idea of not appointing Democrats as chairs of Senate committees, said: "Now, I’ve been reducing the number of Democratic chairs since I came in." As recorded by David Jennings of the Republican-oriented Big Jolly Politics blog, Dewhurst continued: "You know how many committees we have? 17. You know how many Democratic chairs we have? Five. OK? So, I’ve been reducing them — and not one of them is one of the critical committees." He said, too, that "at the end of the day," senators turn to him when it comes to raising the Senate votes needed to advance legislation. Besides, he said, he ultimately succeeded in breaking the filibuster by Democratic Sen. Wendy Davis. We’re not getting into which committees are critical; that’s debatable. But we wondered if it’s correct that Dewhurst has been whittling Democratic committee chairs in the GOP-majority Senate since he assumed his gavel-wielding post in 2003. One of the lieutenant governor’s roles is to appoint committee rosters. That includes deciding which committees to continue or create and whom to appoint to each panel’s coveted chair and vice chair slots. By email, Dewhurst spokesman Travis Considine sent us a document indicating that Dewhurst appointed seven Democratic committee chairs in 2003 and one less in 2013. Considine said he did not have information on changes in the intervening years. To reach a comprehensive count, we scrolled through information posted online on a searchable web page overseen by the Texas Legislative Council. That information indicates that in 2001, before Dewhurst took his helm, Democrats held seven of 15 Senate committee chairmanships, or 47 percent. In 2003, according to the information, Dewhurst appointed Democrats to six of 15 committee chairmanships, or 40 percent. (Unlike Dewhurst’s campaign, we did not consider chairmanships of limited-life select committees.) And according to the same source, Dewhurst named Democrats to six of 18 committee chairmanships, or 33 percent, in 2013. And what precisely happened in the years between? Information on the council’s site indicates that Democrats were appointed to five of 15 committee chairmanships in 2005 and 2007, or 33 percent. Dewhurst named Democrats to six of 18 committee chairmanships, again 33 percent, in 2009, 2011 and 2013. On Dewhurst's watch, the number of Republican chairs has escalated, going from nine in 2003 to 12 since 2009. Our ruling Dewhurst said he has been reducing the number of Democratic Senate committee chairs since becoming lieutenant governor. He cut the number of Democratic chairs, from seven to six, in his first year in the leadership office. Then in 2005, he cut the number from six to five, a total that held in 2007. But as in 2003, Dewhurst named six Democratic chairs each regular legislative session from 2009 through 2013. Upshot: Dewhurst twice reduced the number of Democratic chairs, getting to five, but he also has bestowed chairmanships on six Senate Democrats for nearly half a decade. We rate this claim, which has an element of truth but ignores critical facts, as Mostly False. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ MOSTLY FALSE – The statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression.

pomt-10945	In 2017, ICE "arrested more than 127,000 illegal immigrants with criminal convictions or facing charges of breaking our nation's’ laws," and removed nearly 5,000 gang members.	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2018/jul/25/mike-pence/mike-pence-accurately-cites-ice-arrest-deportation/	Vice President Mike Pence countered Democratic attacks of an immigration agency by highlighting the agency’s enforcement success. Some Democrats have called for restructuring or abolishing U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, claiming it tears apart families and that it has lost its ability to effectively do its job under President Donald Trump. During a trip to Missouri to tout the Trump administration’s tax cuts, Pence chose to highlight ICE’s arrest and deportations in 2017 as signs of its effectiveness. "Last year alone, I’m proud to report to you that ICE agents removed more than 226,000 illegal immigrants from our country," Pence said. "In fact, they arrested more than 127,000 illegal immigrants with criminal convictions or facing charges of breaking our nation's laws, including ICE removed nearly 5,000 gang members from our streets." Readers asked us to verify Pence’s data. We found that he accurately cited ICE numbers. But data also showed that the most common charges and convictions were for traffic offenses, immigration, and "dangerous drugs." Pence’s wording could leave the wrong impression that those criminal convictions were for more serious offenses. At least 226,119 people were deported by ICE in fiscal year 2017, according to the agency. (Fiscal year 2017 started Oct. 1, 2016, so it included nearly four months of the Obama administration.) ICE deported more people the year before, at 240,255. But ICE said the proportion of removals due to ICE arrests was greater in 2017 than in 2016. ICE’s overall removal numbers account for people who were arrested by ICE inside of the country and people apprehended at the border and turned over to ICE for removal. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com Pence’s number of people arrested by ICE checks out with the agency’s data — of 143,470 administrative arrests, nearly 128,000 had criminal convictions or pending criminal charges. Administrative arrests are arrests of people who were either present in the country illegally or had somehow violated the terms of their entry/status, an ICE spokeswoman said. Here’s a breakdown of those arrests: • Criminal convictions: 105,736 • Pending criminal charges: 22,256 • No known criminal charges or convictions: 15,478 A criminal conviction or charge for breaking an American law covers a broad category. The majority stemmed from non-violent offenses. The most common convictions and charges were for immigration, drugs, and traffic offenses, including DUI. Among other offenses ICE listed were homicide, "public peace," "general crimes,"and "liquor." See Figure 2 on PolitiFact.com Pence also said nearly 5,000 gang members had been removed. ICE in fiscal year 2017 deported 5,396 gang members. ICE began tracking gang removals in fiscal year 2014, but does not track removals by specific gang affiliation. Pence’s numbers about ICE’s operations check out. So we rate his statement True. See Figure 3 on PolitiFact.com	None	Mike Pence	None	None	None	2018-07-25T09:00:00	2018-07-19	['None']
pomt-02005	"By the time I left" the State Department, "economic growth was up and opium production was down" in Afghanistan, while "infant mortality declined" and school enrollment rose by more than sevenfold.	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2014/jun/10/hillary-clinton/new-book-hillary-clinton-touts-quality-life-advanc/	In her book, Hard Choices, Hillary Clinton writes about her experiences as secretary of state in the Obama administration. One of the most high-profile countries in her portfolio was Afghanistan, a country that the United States had invaded in 2001 in order to oust the Taliban. In the book, Clinton took some pride in Afghanistan’s accomplishments on her watch. "By the time I left State, the Afghans had made progress," Clinton wrote. "Economic growth was up and opium production was down. Infant mortality declined by 22 percent. Under the Taliban only 900,000 boys and no girls had been enrolled in schools. By 2010, 7.1 million students were enrolled, and nearly 40 percent of them were girls." We decided to check the accuracy of her statistics. We used several sources, including the Brookings Institution’s periodic Afghanistan Index, which collects a wide range of data on the country, as well as information from the World Bank and the World Health Organization. (We won't be addressing whether she or the administration deserves credit for these improvements. The United States, as the major western military and diplomatic force in the country, clearly had an impact, but figuring out exactly how much is more art than science.) Is economic growth up? Given the multitude of challenges it faced, ranging from war to poverty, Afghanistan certainly could have done worse in economic growth than it did between 2009 and 2013. Here’s Afghanistan’s annual percentage increase in gross domestic product since 2000, according to the World Bank. 2000 ‘01 ‘02 ‘03 ‘04 ‘05 ‘06 ‘07 ‘08 ‘09 ‘10 ‘11 ‘12 7.3 7.0 2.9 5.7 1.1 11.2 5.6 3.7 3.6 21.0 8.4 6.1 14.4 According to this data, the country’s economic growth pattern has ranged widely, but it’s certainly been growing rather than shrinking. Still, lest anyone assume that the 14-percent-plus growth in 2012 -- Clinton’s last year as secretary of state -- is the new normal, the International Monetary Fund projected that Afghanistan would grow by a far slower 3.1 percent in 2013 (lower than any year since 2004) and 4.8 percent in 2014. Is opium production down? The Brookings study found that metric tons of opium production has also undergone a zigzagging course in recent years. Whether it declined depends on what time frame you’re looking at. 2002 ‘03 ‘04 ‘05 ‘06 ‘07 ‘08 ‘09 ‘10 ‘11 ‘12 3,400 3,600 4,200 4,100 6,100 8,200 7,700 6,900 3,600 5,800 3,700 The data show that opium production surged in 2006, peaked in 2007, and began falling in 2008 -- before Clinton became secretary of state. During her tenure, it went down, then up, then down again. Its 2012 level was roughly on par with the amount in 2002 and 2003. During Clinton’s four years, opium production averaged 5,000 metric tons per year. That’s slightly less than the average of the four years preceding her time as secretary of state. Has infant mortality declined? Mortality rates for children under 5 has indeed declined, at least according to the World Health Organization. Here’s the WHO’s data on infant mortality rate -- deaths from birth to age 1 per 1000 live births: 1990 1995 2000 2005 2010 2012 120 102 94 83 74 71 The decline between 2005 and 2012 -- the closest we could get to a "before and after" for Clinton -- is a 14 percent decrease, a bit smaller than the 22 percent. Is school enrollment up sevenfold? This is the statistic for which Clinton seems most on-target -- and the one about which Afghan officials can feel most proud, assuming the data are accurate. Here are the enrollment figures in millions, according to the Brookings study: 2001 ‘02 ‘03 ‘04 ‘05 ‘06 ‘07 ‘08 ‘09 ‘10 ‘11 ‘12 ‘13 <1.0 2.0 3.0 3.7 4.7 5.2 5.6 5.9 6.5 7.1 8.3 9.0 10.0 So, for total enrollment, Clinton is exactly right. As for girls, the Brookings report says that "virtually none" of the students enrolled in 2001 were girls, a number that increased to roughly 40 percent by 2010. So she’s right about girls’ enrollment as well. Clinton is probably three-quarters accurate, said Michael O'Hanlon, a Brookings scholar who helped create the Afghanistan Index. "The opium issue hasn’t been encouraging, but the other trend lines are all essentially what she writes," he said. Our rating Clinton said that over the course of her tenure as secretary of state, economic growth and school enrollment in Afghanistan was up, while opium production and infant mortality were down. Her claims about school enrollment, infant mortality, and economic growth are basically accurate, but the data on opium production suggests that her claim is somewhat exaggerated. We rate the claim Mostly True.	None	Hillary Clinton	None	None	None	2014-06-10T17:24:46	2014-06-10	['Afghanistan', 'United_States_Department_of_State']
pomt-02593	"John Cornyn backed his pal David Dewhurst" for the U.S. Senate over Ted Cruz.	false	/texas/statements/2014/jan/28/steve-stockman/john-cornyn-was-neutral-2012-us-senate-race-until-/	An occasionally out-of-pocket Republican challenger to U.S. Sen. John Cornyn of Texas has leveled eye-catching charges about the second-term senator, calling Cornyn liberal and also suggesting he’s been supportive of the Obamacare law that Cornyn initially voted against in late 2009. Cornyn’s campaign spokesman, Drew Brandewie, emailed us this month asking us to look into another claim by U.S. Rep. Steve Stockman, R-Friendswood. On a Stockman campaign web page, Stockman said Cornyn supported Lt. Gov. David Dewhurst in the 2012 Senate election won by Tea Party favorite Ted Cruz, who started the race as a longshot. Stockman’s words: "And while John Cornyn backed his pal David Dewhurst, I back Ted Cruz." We're not sure how to pin whether Stockman now backs Cruz; the state's junior senator isn't on a ballot in 2014. We focused, instead, on whether Cornyn backed Dewhurst over Cruz in 2012. Stockman, whom we were unable to reach, did not elaborate on his claim on his website. During the 2012 race, Dewhurst, lieutenant governor since 2003, was the early favorite as an established statewide officeholder; Cruz hadn't previously run for office. And along the way there was a hint of grit between Cruz and Cornyn, whom Cruz publicly declined to endorse for a Senate party leadership post. On March 5, 2012, we rated as Half True a Dewhurst claim that Cruz had slurred Republican senators including Cornyn as "graybeards" and "spineless jellyfish." Cruz used those descriptives when talking about Republican candidates, conceivably including senators whom he viewed as insufficiently conservative. Yet it wasn’t clear Cruz was referring to Cornyn. But Brandewie pointed out news accounts indicating Cornyn was neutral in the race until Cruz won their party’s nomination. These included a news blog post by the Dallas Morning News on the night of the Senate runoff July 31, 2012, stating that Cornyn—"who remained neutral in the race, despite Cruz’s reluctance to back him in… his bid for Senate GOP whip—praised Cruz for a ‘well-deserved and well-earned victory.’" The post quoted Cornyn as saying in a statement: "This has been a hard-fought and spirited primary battle and the people of Texas would have been fortunate to have any one of these well-qualified candidates as their next U.S. senator." Separately, we spotted a July 27, 2012, news blog post by the Austin American-Statesman stating that Cornyn had cast his Senate runoff ballot that morning without announcing a preferred aspirant. The post quoted Cornyn as saying: "I’m not picking sides for a very practical reason. I’m going to have to work — it will be my pleasure to work — with whoever the Republican nominee is. We are looking forward to an ally and reinforcements to help us fight the battle for the free-enterprise system and help turn the country around." A July 29, 2012, Statesman news story noted that Cornyn that year was chairing the National Republican Senatorial Committee, which helps Republicans in Senate races. Cornyn, the story said, "has kept mum about his home state race and instead has focused on getting other Republicans elected across the country." We found no news stories saying Cornyn was backing Dewhurst in the race. Our ruling Stockman said Cornyn supported Dewhurst over Cruz for the U.S. Senate in 2012. There’s no evidence of that. In contrast, news reports say Cornyn revealed no preference before congratulating Cruz for winning the Republican nomination, making Stockman's claim False. FALSE – The statement is not accurate.

Ted Strickland, highlighted Strickland’s focus on primary education during his first term in office. She noted that the governor increased school funding by 5.5 percent (a claim that we rated as false) and that he committed the state to focus on science, technology, engineering and math — or STEM. She then said this focus on education is bringing Ohio national recognition. "The critics have spoken and every Ohioan should hear what they have to say about our schools," she said. "The Education Commission of the States gave Ohio its award for the most innovative education reform plan in the nation. Education Week rates Ohio schools in the top five in the nation." Indeed, in Education Week’s Quality Counts 2010 report, Ohio’s education system was ranked fifth best in the nation, with an overall grade of B-. But a deeper look behind Education Week’s grading system reveals some less-flattering findings. To calculate the overall rankings, the trade publication graded each state on four primary areas. Ohio’s rating in some of those areas belies its lofty overall ranking: In ‘Chance for Success,’ a category that gauges how well an Ohio education prepares students for the next stages of their schooling or life, Ohio did not fare well for the number of students attending preschool and for the number of adults with two- or four-year college degrees. Rank: 25th; Grade: C+. In the ‘School Finance’ category, Ohio again rates in the middle of the pack, despite increasing spending on public education in recent years, as Brown noted. Rank: 18th; Grade: C+. Ohio rated best in the ‘Standards, Assessment & Accountability’ category, recognized for having well-reasoned and challenging learning objectives and curriculums. Rank: 3rd; Grade: A. And in ‘Teaching Profession,’ an area judging each state’s quality of teachers and strength of its educational leaders, Ohio is considered average. Rank: 14th; Grade: C+. Brown’s statement is correct about the overall ranking. But we believe it is important to add context to that overall ranking by noting that Ohio received C+ ratings, or barely average, in three of the four areas graded. We rate this statement True.

pomt-04202	Says that in 2011, Oregon had "the second fastest growing economy in the nation."	true	/oregon/statements/2012/dec/05/john-kitzhaber/did-oregon-have-nations-second-fastest-growing-eco/	Oregon’s economy is looking up -- and in a recent speech at the Oregon Leadership Summit, Gov. John Kitzhaber counted the ways. Unemployment is falling, our credit rating is rising, the state ranks as one of the friendliest to business and just last year, Oregon had "the second fastest growing economy in the nation." It was that last one that caught our ear. Oregon usually lags behind the country -- but when the state is hot, it’s hot, so it wasn’t out of the realm of possibility. Still we decided to check it out. We got in touch with Amy Wojcicki, the governor’s spokeswoman, and she reminded us of an article The Oregonian published last June. The story’s headline spoke for itself: "Oregon economy growing at nation’s second-fastest rate." The story cited figures from the U.S. Bureau of Economic Statistics. In 2011, Oregon’s gross domestic product increased by 4.7 percent. The state was second only to North Dakota, which saw its GDP grow by 7.6 percent that year. The numbers show the governor was right. Still, we decided to dig just a little bit further because we know, when it comes to economics and statistics, nothing is ever quite as clear cut as it seems. We called up Tim Duy, a University of Oregon economist. "That's the fact -- you can certainly point to it." But, he added, "I would be wary. "I think it's important to recognize that a significant amount of those gains came from manufacturing" -- particularly microchips and related industries. All of this was covered in the original article. Indeed, manufacturing was far and away the biggest driver of growth that year. Intel alone had huge growth. So, we asked, what’s the problem with that? "It's a real effect," Duy said, "But is this the experience of the average Oregonian? I don't think the average Oregonian perceives the economy as growing at the second fastest rate in the nation." We asked Duy if he could suggest another measurement that might provide a fuller picture -- he suggested the rate of job growth. Fortunately, this just came up in the state’s most recent revenue forecast. According to that report, which based its numbers on figures from the W.P. Carey School of Business at Arizona State University, Oregon ranks 26th overall in that category. Said another way: We’re perfectly average. In a recent speech, Gov. Kitzhaber mentioned that a year ago, Oregon boasted the second-fastest growing economy in the nation. It was just one fact of several that he referenced to make the point that the state is rebounding from a dismal recession. According to the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis, the governor’s statement is accurate. We agree with Duy that most Oregonians don’t feel like they’re living in an economic boom, but that doesn’t make the governor wrong. We rate this claim True.

pomt-08689	"On (Rob Portman's) watch as Bush's trade czar, our deficit with China exploded" and "as Bush's budget chief, Portman oversaw a spending spree that doubled the deficit."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/sep/09/lee-fisher/lee-fisher-hammers-rob-portman-record-bush-adminis/	As a Democrat trying to win a Republican-held Senate seat in economically distressed Ohio, it's not surprising that Lee Fisher would focus his campaign ads on the economy. In a recent ad, he attacked opponent Rob Portman's service under President George W. Bush as U.S trade representative and then as director of the Office of Management and Budget. "Congressman Rob Portman knows how to grow the economy -- in China," the ad says. "He voted for billions in tax breaks for companies that export jobs. On his watch as Bush's trade czar, our deficit with China exploded, sending 100,000 Ohio jobs overseas. As Bush's budget chief, Portman oversaw a spending spree that doubled the deficit. Outsourcing, bad trade deals, soaring deficicts. Congressman Portman -- a real economic plan, but not for Ohio." Let's get something out of the way first: The honorific in the ad aside, Portman last served in Congress in 2005. (Perhaps the Fisher camp thinks anyone associated with Congress will attract extra ire from voters.) We also won't check the jobs figure, which is an estimate over which reasonable people can disagree. Instead, we'll focus on two other claims about Portman -- that "on his watch as Bush's trade czar, our deficit with China exploded," and that "as Bush's budget chief, Portman oversaw a spending spree that doubled the deficit." To analyze the claim about the trade deficit, we turned to the Census Bureau, which tracks foreign trade statistics on a month-by-month and year-by-year basis. We looked at the time that Portman served as U.S. trade representative, which was from April 29, 2005, to May 26, 2006. We found that the trade deficit went up by almost $228 billion over that 13-month period. For comparison's sake, we looked at the 13 months prior to Portman taking the job. We found that the trade deficit with China rose by about $189 million during that period. Comparing those two numbers, the cumulative trade deficit under Portman was about 21 percent higher than it was for the equivalent time period just before he took office. We didn't see any direct disagreement on this point in the Portman camp's news release attacking the ad or in their e-mail interview with us. The release tries to deflect that ad by offering several examples of how Portman went after the Chinese on trade enforcement. But it doesn't offer an alternate way of looking at trade deficit numbers. So while the term "exploded" is a bit of an exaggeration, a 21 percent increase is nothing to sneeze at. As for the deficit, we turned to OMB historical tables. As OMB director from May 26, 2006, to August 3, 2007, Portman was deeply involved in the fiscal year 2008 budget process. (The fiscal 2007 budget would have been handled by his predecessor.) The fiscal 2008 deficit of nearly $459 billion was more than twice the fiscal 2007 deficit, which approached $161 billion. Portman's camp counters that Bush's 2008 budget mapped out a plan for a fiscal 2008 budget deficit that was actually smaller than the fiscal 2007 budget deficit, with surpluses returning by fiscal 2012. The Portman campaign blames changes made by the Democratic-controlled Congress for busting the budget. Since the president's budget is essentially a wish list that is always subject to negotiation before implementation, we don't buy the argument that Portman should simply be judged on the initial proposal in the budget process. Gene Steuerle, an economist at the liberal-leaning Urban Institute, says that the final deficit numbers owed at least as much, if not more, to decisions and events after Portman had left OMB, including Bush's economic stimulus package -- the financial bailout and the decline in tax revenues that followed the official start of the recession in December 2007. Indeed, in OMB's Mid-Session Review -- a budget document produced on July 11, 2007, shortly before Portman left OMB -- the agency projected the deficit for fiscal 2008 to be $258 billion. If we take this projection and compare it to the 2007 deficit, it's about 60 percent higher. That's less than double. This brings up the broader question of how much of the burden for these economic numbers should fall on anyone who holds Portman's former positions. The president, Congress and other cabinet officials have a say in both areas, and broader economic trends shape the patterns as well. "There's nothing a USTR can do about it when the primary cause is U.S. demand and a mercantilist Chinese exchange rate policy," said J.D. Foster, an economist at the conservative Heritage Foundation. On the other hand, the ad is careful to say that the economic developments occurred "on (Portman's) watch," rather than that he was solely responsible for them. (That makes it safer than a prior Fisher claim that PolitiFact Ohio ruled False -- that Portman was "the one who actually sucked the jobs out of the (Mahoning) Valley and sent them to China.") So let's review what we found. The ad overstated how big the jump in both statistics was, but in both cases, the numbers did increase significantly on Portman's watch. And while we acknowledge that Portman isn't the only factor -- nor, perhaps, even the primary factor -- in the course of both economic trends, we do think that in the middle of a campaign, challenging an opponent on his record in office is fair game. On balance, we rate the item Half True.	None	Lee Fisher	None	None	None	2010-09-09T11:16:35	2010-09-07	['George_W._Bush', 'China']
pomt-13224	When Hillary Clinton "ran the State Department, $6 billion was missing. How do you miss $6 billion? You ran the State Department, $6 billion was either stolen — they don't know."	pants on fire!	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/oct/20/donald-trump/trump-wrongly-says-6-billion-went-missing-state-de/	At the third and final presidential debate, Donald Trump claimed that Hillary Clinton’s State Department lost $6 billion, and that the money might have been stolen. "The problem is, you talk, but you don't get anything done, Hillary. You don't," Trump said in Las Vegas Oct. 19. "Just like when you ran the State Department, $6 billion was missing. How do you miss $6 billion? You ran the State Department, $6 billion was either stolen — they don't know. It's gone, $6 billion. If you become president, this country is going to be in some mess. Believe me." Clinton responded, "Well, first of all, what he just said about the State Department is not only untrue, it's been debunked numerous times." In fact, the claim that the State Department lost $6 billion, or that it was stolen, has been debunked. Including by us. Trump’s inaccurate claim stems from a misreading of a March 2014 alert out of the State Department’s Office of the Inspector General. The alert found that paperwork for various contracts was mismanaged. These contracts were together worth about $6 billion. The money didn’t go missing; the paperwork did. The State Department Inspector General sent out an alert that summarized previous audits, which found that paperwork for over $6 billion worth of contracts from 2008 to 2014 "were incomplete or could not be located at all." The period of the audits included time before Clinton became secretary of state. A spokesman for the Office of the Inspector General told PolitiFact previously the alert speaks for itself, but many seemed to misinterpret what it actually said. The confusion prompted Inspector General Steve Linick to pen a clarification in the Washington Post. "Some have concluded based on this that $6 billion is missing. The alert, however, did not draw that conclusion," he wrote. "Instead, it found that the failure to adequately maintain contract files — documents necessary to ensure the full accounting of U.S. tax dollars — ‘creates significant financial risk and demonstrates a lack of internal control over the department’s contract actions.’ " In other words, the State Department was terrible at paperwork. The $6 billion figure refers to the total amount affected by file mismanagement. It’s akin to failing to get a receipt for your $20 lunch. Documentation over where that $20 went is gone, but not the $20 itself. For example, the inspector general alert notes that an audit of the Bureau of African Affairs found that the office was unable to provide full administrative files for eight separate contracts, valued at a combined $34.8 million. So the State Department under Clinton may have been financially disorganized and, according to the alert, opening itself up to fraud. But it didn’t "lose" $6 billion. Nor was there any suggestion it was "stolen." Our ruling Trump said that when Clinton "ran the State Department, $6 billion was missing. How do you miss $6 billion? You ran the State Department, $6 billion was either stolen — they don't know." The $6 billion figure comes from a State Department inspector general report that found paperwork for various contracts had been mismanaged. The $6 billion was not missing or stolen — it had been doled out in a number of contracts — but the paperwork was missing. We rate Trump’s claim Pants on Fire. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/5513387c-9761-413a-abbd-a5d048e1f79c Correction: The alert summarized previous audits of State Department contracts.

pomt-12528	"Trump looking to open up E Coast & new areas for offshore oil drilling when Congress has passed no new safety standards since BP"	true	/florida/statements/2017/apr/21/edward-markey/trump-wants-expand-oil-drilling-despite-congress-n/	On the anniversary of the Deepwater Horizon BP oil spill, Sen. Edward Markey, D-Mass., attacked President Donald Trump for his stance on drilling and portrayed Congress as doing nothing in the aftermath of the 2010 explosion. "Trump looking to open up E Coast & new areas for offshore oil drilling when Congress has passed no new safety standards since BP," Markey tweeted April 20. We wanted to know what Trump’s plans were and if Congress has done nothing since the explosion. The April 20, 2010, explosion of BP’s Deepwater Horizon rig was the worst offshore drilling catastrophe in U.S. history. The explosion killed 11 workers, and 134 million gallons of oil were released into the Gulf of Mexico. We emailed a spokesman for Trump and did not get a reply; however, a spokesman for the Bureau of Ocean Management sent information about the reorganization of federal agencies that oversee drilling during the Obama administration. Trump on drilling In 2006, Congress passed a bill to ban oil drilling within 125 miles off much of Florida’s coast and up to 235 miles at some points. The ban is set to expire in 2022. There have been efforts by some Republicans to expand offshore drilling, but so far they have failed. Sen. Bill Cassidy, R-La, sponsored The American Energy and Conservation Act of 2016 to allow drilling 50 miles off Florida’s Gulf Shores, but the Senate rejected moving ahead on it in November. In response, Sen. Bill Nelson, D-Fla., filed a bill to extend the ban by five years, but the Senate hasn’t voted on his bill. During the campaign, Trump generally spoke favorably of expanding oil drilling, although he sounded skeptical about a proposal to allow offshore drilling closer to the Florida beaches in an interview with the Tampa Bay Times, PolitiFact’s parent company, in February 2016. "They've already got plenty in the Gulf," Trump said. "It would be a little bit of a shame (to expand drilling closer to Florida), because there's so much fracking, and there's so much oil that we have now that we never thought possible. That's an issue I'd absolutely study and do the right thing." But later in the campaign Trump endorsed more drilling and promised to "accomplish a complete American energy independence. Complete. Complete." Trump’s America First Energy Plan called for opening up onshore and offshore leasing on federal lands. A couple months into his administration in March, Trump’s Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke proposed leasing 73 million acres offshore Texas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, and Florida for oil and gas exploration and development starting in August 2017. That was similar to the Obama administration plan. As he was leaving office, President Barack Obama banned drilling in the Arctic and Atlantic oceans for the next five years, but allowed it in the gulf primarily in areas other than Florida. But despite Trump’s rhetoric, the industry hasn’t shown much interest in expanding drilling due to low oil prices, said Athan Manuel, who directs Sierra Club’s Lands Protection Program. "Ideologically the Trump administration wants to push drilling everywhere, but companies are being cautious right now because the cost so low," he said. On March 28, Trump issued an executive order that called for a review of agency actions that "potentially burden the safe, efficient development of domestic energy resources," including oil. Regulations following explosion After BP’s Deepwater Horizon explosion, lawmakers couldn’t agree on safety standard legislation. In 2010, the House approved an overhaul of safety standards, but it never got the approval in the Senate. The Obama administration took some steps to tighten rules in an effort to avoid similar spills, although the rules took several years to develop, and some environmentalists have criticized them as insufficient. In April 2015 -- five years after the explosion -- the administration unveiled a proposed rule to tighten safety standards for blowout preventers, devices that are designed to stop undersea oil wells from exploding. During the Deepwater Horizon explosion, the blowout preventer malfunctioned. The rule was finalized in March 2016. Bob Bea, an expert on risk management and a former Shell executive, told PolitiFact that little has changed in either the regulatory regime or the industrial regime in the United States. He repeatedly said during the Obama administration that the government hadn’t gone far enough in terms of risk assessment. "Yes, new government 'rules' have been enacted, and new industry 'guidelines' have been issued, but either they have not been implemented or they have not been implemented properly," he said. The Government Accountability Office reported in March 2017 that the Interior Department has struggled to successfully implement key initiatives to improve offshore oversight. For example, a risk-based facility inspection initiative was halted due to concerns about its usefulness and unclear protocols. Our ruling Markey tweeted, "Trump looking to open up E Coast & new areas for offshore oil drilling when Congress has passed no new safety standards since BP." During the campaign, Trump frequently expressed support to open up more oil drilling. Since in office, his administration proposed leasing 73 million acres offshore starting in August 2017. After the 2010 Deepwater Horizon explosion, Congress couldn’t agree on safety standards. The Obama administration took some steps to improve safety standards, though some environmentalists say that the government didn’t go far enough. We rate this claim True.

pomt-03003	"No doctors who went to an American medical school will be accepting Obamacare."	pants on fire!	/truth-o-meter/statements/2013/oct/16/ann-coulter/ann-coulter-says-no-doctors-who-went-american-medi/	Conservative commentator Ann Coulter is not known for mincing words, but a recent column prompted many PolitiFact readers to contact us, seeking a fact-check. In the Oct. 9, 2013, column -- titled, "Democrats to America: We Own the Government!" -- Coulter pummels Democrats over provisions of President Barack Obama’s health care law. We were most intrigued by one claim, since we hadn’t heard it before -- that "no doctors who went to an American medical school will be accepting Obamacare." Really? We tried to ask Coulter through her speaker’s bureau if she could provide any evidence for this, but we did not receive a reply. We are sure the claim wasn't intended as a joke, because it's included in a bullet-point list of straightforward criticisms of the law. So let’s start by looking at the claim literally. Is there any provision of the Affordable Care Act that would prevent U.S.-trained doctors from accepting "Obamacare" patients -- that is, patients who secure insurance through the marketplaces that are a centerpiece of the law? We feel comfortable, both from talking to experts and from our years of reporting on the law, that there is no such provision. If there were, it would probably be ripe for challenge on constitutional grounds. In fact, when we asked experts for their reaction to this claim, their responses included words such as "outrageous," "ridiculous" and "ludicrous." "Of course there's nothing in the law that would bar any doctor from seeing any patient," said Katherine Baicker, a health economist at the Harvard School of Public Health. So, no dice on the literal reading of her claim. Still, we wondered whether there was some other tiny, buried grain of truth in what Coulter claimed. Is the idea that American-trained doctors will be pickier about accepting insurance? There is some evidence that medical practices are wary about taking patients from plans sold on the marketplace. In September, the Medical Group Management Association -- a trade group for medical-practice executives -- surveyed 1,000 physician groups that collectively employ 47,500 doctors. The survey asked, among other things, "Does your practice plan to participate with any new health insurance products sold on an ACA exchange?" Only 29 percent of respondents gave a definitive "yes." That rate is twice as high as the share that that said "no" (14 percent) but less than those that were still weighing their options (40 percent). The top reasons? A fear of bureaucratic regulations, low reimbursement rates and the need to collect payment from patients with higher deductibles. However, it’s important to remember that this study is not evidence that can be used to support Coulter’s specific claim, because it says nothing about foreign-trained doctors. In fact, the closer you look at the issue of foreign-trained doctors, the less plausible Coulter’s claim becomes. According to a 2010 study by the American Medical Association, about 26 percent of physicians in the United States were trained in other countries. This number includes both foreign-born doctors who trained overseas and Americans who received their medical education in other countries. But tough licensing requirements for foreign-trained doctors -- requirements that won’t be changed by Obama’s law -- are keeping the number of foreign-trained physicians low. A key barrier is the need to obtain a residency in the United States, even if an applicant had practiced or had a residency overseas. According to the New York Times, just 42 percent of foreign-trained immigrant physicians who applied for residencies through the leading matching service succeeded, compared to 94 percent of those who had trained in the United States. With such high barriers to entry, it’s not credible that a flood of foreign-trained doctors will suddenly swoop in and, without the help of a single American-trained doctor, serve each one of the newly insured patients who bought policies on the new marketplaces. "I haven't seen any study that would suggest that American-trained doctors would be disproportionately less likely to see the newly insured," Baicker said. And even if there were such evidence, "disproportionate is a far cry from ‘none,’ " said Gail Wilensky, the former head of Medicare and Medicaid under President George H.W. Bush. "There is no limit to the nonsense that some are saying. This borders on the absurd." Our ruling Coulter said that "no doctors who went to an American medical school will be accepting Obamacare." Nothing in the law bars American-trained physicians from treating newly insured people under Obamacare. It’s a ridiculous claim -- one with a whiff of xenophobia -- that merits a Pants on Fire.

pomt-01100	"January through November 2014, the year so far, were the hottest first 11 months of any year recorded."	true	/rhode-island/statements/2015/jan/12/sheldon-whitehouse/sen-sheldon-whitehouse-says-2014-track-be-warmest-/	The seasons may change, the weather may shift, but U.S. Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse keeps trying to get his colleagues to, as he puts it, wake up to the threat of climate change. As naysayers insist that global temperatures haven't warmed since around 1997, a claim that has validity only because the time around 1997 was an exceptionally warm year, Whitehouse took to the floor of the Senate on Dec. 17 to report that 2014 was shaping up as the warmest in modern history. "January through November 2014, the year so far, were the hottest first 11 months of any year recorded. So unless something dramatic changes in December, 2014 is on track to be the hottest year since we began keeping records back in 1880. That would mean that 14 of the warmest 15 years on record are the 14 years of this century." PolitiFact usually doesn't deal with predictions, but we thought we’d see if the 11-month numbers for 2014 were as Whitehouse described. When we contacted his office, spokesman Seth Larson sent us to the November "State of the Climate" report from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). In addition to monthly data, it looks at figures from the past three months, the year to date and levels of both Arctic and Antarctic sea ice. It reports, "The first 11 months of 2014 was the warmest such period on record, with a combined global land and ocean average surface temperature of 1.22 degrees F. (0.68 degrees C.) above the 20th century average of 57.0 degrees F. (13.9 degrees C.)." That's a land-ocean surface average of 58.22 degrees F. (The margin of error for these measurements is plus or minus 0.18 degrees F., which means the actual temperature could be as high as 58.4 or as low as 58.04. The previous record -- 58.02 degrees F. -- was set in 2010. The biggest reason wasn't the surface land temperatures, but it was the increase in the surface temperatures in the oceans, where the first 11 months of 2014 were the warmest on record. Many scientists say that a lot of excess heat from heat-trapping carbon dioxide is being stored in the oceans. NOAA hasn't released its December temperature numbers yet, but the Japan Meteorological Agency has. It has concluded that 2014 broke all records going back as far as 1891. It may not feel like global warming is a problem when below average cold is sending a collective shiver through much of the United States. But the U.S. makes up only 6 percent of Earth's land mass and less than 2 percent of its surface area. Whitehouse reported the data accurately. We rate his claim as True.

pomt-12172	"The number of complaints against police officers has decreased from an average when Mr. (Rick) Baker was mayor from 78 to 14."	mostly true	/florida/statements/2017/aug/02/rick-kriseman/have-number-complaints-against-police-dropped-unde/	Rick Baker won’t definitively say whether he would retain police chief Anthony Holloway if the former St. Petersburg mayor wins a third term at city hall. Mayor Rick Kriseman has been working to show voters he made the right choice in hiring Holloway in 2014, bragging about Holloway’s achievements and warning that it could disappear if Baker wins the election. Kriseman said Holloway has helped improve community-police relationships in the city. "The number of complaints against police officers has decreased from an average when Mr. Baker was mayor from 78 to 14," Kriseman said at the July 25 debate hosted by the Tampa Bay Times and Bay News 9. We wanted to know if complaints dropped by that much, and why. Kriseman’s evidence comes from the police department’s Office of Professional Standards, which investigates complaints and criminal misconduct. The complaints are broken down into citizen-initiated and department-initiated complaints. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com The figures Kriseman cites are accurate for the number of citizen-initiated complaints. The average number of department-initiated complaints also fell from Baker to Kriseman, from 76 to 39. Citizen-initiated complaints have — for the most part — been dropping since the beginning of 2001. They average number also decreased during the four-year term of Baker's successor, Mayor Bill Foster. From January 2010 to January 2014, the average number of citizen-initiated complaints was 41. Asked to explain the drop, the police department credited increased communication between residents and police. "People understand what we do and why we do it, and our sergeants and frontline supervisors have become more accustomed to explaining why things are done a certain way," said Maj. Tim Brockman, who has been the Office of Professional Standards commander for two years and with the department for over two decades. Concerns or inquiries are sometimes handled by police before a formal complaint is filed, he added. Holloway has made several moves to implement a community policing philosophy, a Kriseman campaign pledge. Holloway has encouraged officers to leave their cruisers and talk to residents, building relationships with the people the police are serving. In 2014, the department started a Park, Walk and Talks program that requires all uniformed officers to walk a patrol area at least an hour a week. Police spokeswoman Yolanda Fernandez said the department has 384 uniformed officers and in the most recent three months of 2017 (April, May and June), there were 5,809 logged walks. From the 1990s until 2006, the department's approach was different: More than 40 officers were each committed to a particular neighborhood. However, former police chief Chuck Harmon, who held the job from 2001 to 2014, said he stopped that initiative amid complaints from the department. "One of the things that I found is that community officers were engaging with just a handful of people, and those people were demanding most of their time," Harmon said. Harmon also said he became police chief at "tough time" when relationships between the police and community were strained. Before Harmon was hired, Baker had selected Mack Vines to serve as police chief. Vines was fired by Baker after he used the term "orangutan" to describe the actions of a black suspect's resistance. Finally, we'll note that law enforcement agencies don't record complaints the same way, making it difficult to compare St. Petersburg's practices to other jurisdictions. The Pinellas County Sheriff's Office takes a very broad look at complaints. Any person who calls in, writes a letter or emails with a concern is counted in the data provided by the department. In 2016, 64 members were investigated by a commander within their department and 44 members were investigated by the administrative division. St. Petersburg police included investigations by the department and the Office of Professional Standards — which does not include some of the call-ins that were determined to not be a complaint. Our ruling Kriseman said, "The number of complaints against police officers has decreased on an average when Mr. Baker was mayor from 78 to 14." Those numbers check out for citizen-initiated complaints. The city attributes the decline to increased communication with the community and the police, among other factors. It’s worth noting that citizen-initiated complaints for the most part have been declining for the past decade-plus, which might not be apparent in Kriseman's wording. Kriseman’s claim is accurate but needs additional information. For that reason, we rate it Mostly True.

pomt-15371	"The House of Representatives just voted 300-131 to remove ‘country-of-origin labeling’ on chicken, pork, and beef sold in the U.S."	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/jul/02/facebook-posts/canadian-hog-farmers-and-congress-want-repeal-cons/	Thanks to a little-known congressional bill, it may soon be impossible to tell whether your Fourth of July burger is all-American Angus or beef imported from the Amazon, according to a Facebook meme. "The House of Representatives just voted 300-131 to remove ‘country-of-origin labeling’ on chicken, pork, and beef sold in the United States," the meme says. "Sorry but you don’t deserve to know where your meat is coming from." What beef could the House possibly have with the consumer-friendly law? We looked into the vote in question and found an interesting story of international trade disputes, riled up Canadian hog farmers, and "jingoist fears." Meat of the matter Under the country-of-origin labeling law, or COOL, supermarkets have to tell consumers where their meat, fish, and nuts are produced with varying degrees of specificity (i.e. "Born in Canada, Slaughtered in the U.S.", "Farm-Raised in Vietnam", or simply a laundry list of all the countries the product has passed through). COOL passed in 2002 but wasn’t fully implemented until March 2009. By then, Canada already had a bone to pick with the law, saying it violated World Trade Organization agreements. A mandatory "made-in" stamp discriminated against foreign hog farmers and cattle ranchers and was too costly to boot, according to Canada. Joining Canada’s complaint were a long list of other countries. Between 2011 and 2015, the WTO ruled four times that COOL was inconsistent with trade agreements. The United States made several unsuccessful appeals, but eventually Canada and Mexico asked the WTO for permission to impose retaliatory tariffs totalling $3 billion. The WTO’s decision is pending. In May of 2015, House Agriculture Committee Chair K. Michael Conaway, R-Texas, introduced H.R. 2393, a bill to repeal the labeling requirements for ground and muscle cuts of beef and pork -- and threw in chicken for good measure. "Retaliation by Canada and Mexico will soon become a reality, meaning economically devastating tariffs on a broad spectrum of U.S. exports," Conaway wrote in Roll Call. "Ripple effects will be felt in nearly every industry, every state and every consumer’s wallet. This is why COOL for beef, pork and chicken — nothing more than a failed government experiment — must be repealed." On June 10, the House passed the repeal bill by a not-entirely partisan vote of 300-131: a third of House Democrats voted in favor of the Republican-backed bill. Saving COOL’s bacon The meme’s wording implies that the country-of-origin labeling law’s fate is sealed, but that’s a bit hammed up. The bill now awaits the Senate’s and, ultimately, President Barack Obama’s approval. In the upper chamber, COOL repeal will be more of a battle. "The politics are going to be much, much more difficult in the Senate," said Victoria Guida, a trade reporter for Politico. "Part of the reason this passed the House so easily is because so many other industries, outside of the meat world, are freaked out about retaliation. But the Senate tends to be a little more big-picture about policies, and straight repeal is expected to have a tough time." The Senate Agricultural Committee held hearings on June 25, where Chairman Pat Roberts, R-Kan., called for repeal. In lieu of completely getting rid of the labeling law, top Democrat, Sen. Debbie Stabenow of Michigan, proposed a voluntary labeling system supported by some Republicans but rejected by Conaway. We didn’t hear back from the White House about what the president plans to do if the bill reaches his desk. If the repeal is greenlit by both the Senate and the White House, country-of-origin still won’t be prohibited from meat packaging. As per Stabenow’s proposal, it could potentially mirror the USDA’s paid grading service of beef (i.e. "prime choice" and "select"), though supporters say that’s not enough. "The (meat) industry has had plenty of time to do a COOL program, and they didn't. So we have mandatory COOL. That is the solution that provides consumers with what they’re demanding," Chris Waldrop of the Consumer Federation of America. What’s at 'steak' At its core, COOL is a consumer rights law, intended to help people make purchasing decisions -- be it supporting American ranchers or boycotting beef associated with Amazon deforestation. Yet it has provoked intense debate. While 90 percent of Americans want country-of-origin labeling, the interest doesn’t necessarily reflect in the dollars spent, says Jayson Lusk, an agricultural economist at Oklahoma State University. "Analysis of scanner data from grocery stores shows essentially no impact of (mandatory country-of-origin labeling) when buying meat," he said. "Despite this, there are real and demonstrable costs to processors and retailers. Thus, the totality of evidence suggests that COOL does not pass a cost-benefit test." Canada and Mexico have also argued that the labeling might make people think U.S. products are safer, even when experts say there is little evidence to support or refute that point. "U.S. companies have been doing a marvelous job of poisoning us for years," said Bill Marler, a food-borne illness attorney and publisher of Food Safety News. He pointed out that Malaysia banned American apples earlier this year due to a listeria outbreak, and Mexico rejected Californian lettuce in 2006 after growers found E. coli on the crop. While Marler thinks COOL can feed "jingoist fears," he nonetheless supports it, as he believes in greater transparency in the food system. Like Marler, 283 consumer, agricultural, environmental, labor, and faith-based groups say COOL is about empowering consumers. In a letter ultimately unheeded by Conaway, they urged the House to not bow to the standard scare tactics of trade partners. "We shouldn't automatically repeal a law passed by Congress because an international trade tribunal tells us it violates trade law. We first need to look at other options aside from repeal," said Ben Lilliston of the Institute for Agriculture and Trade Policy, a sustainable farming advocacy group. He added that COOL laws exist around the world, and United States has willingly paid tariffs when it’s disagreed with past WTO rulings. "Consumers have a legitimate interest in knowing where their food comes from," said Waldrop of the Consumer Federation of America. Our ruling "The House of Representatives just voted 300-131 to remove ‘country-of-origin labeling’ on chicken, pork, and beef sold in the United States," according to a Facebook meme. The bill in question seeks to repeal mandatory country-of-origin labeling or COOL from ground and muscle cuts of chicken, pork, and beef. The House passed it in June this year with a 300-131 vote, after Canada and Mexico said the consumer rights law was unfair to foreign hog farmers and cattle ranchers and threatened to impose retaliatory tariffs. The Senate has yet to decide on the labeling law’s fate and, at this early stage, there has been support for making COOL voluntary. While country-of-origin labeling isn’t quite dead meat, the House voted for repeal. We rate the claim True.	None	Facebook posts	None	None	None	2015-07-02T11:06:44	2015-06-29	['United_States']
pomt-04368	"Jim Renacci tried to avoid paying taxes on nearly $14 million that he made."	true	/ohio/statements/2012/oct/22/betty-sutton/betty-sutton-says-jim-renacci-tried-avoid-paying-t/	The congressional contest between Democratic Rep. Betty Sutton and Republican Rep. Jim Renacci is among the nation’s most costly and hard-fought races, and has also devolved into one of the nastiest. After Renacci placed ads accusing Sutton of "voting to raise taxes on just about everyone," Sutton fired back with an ad that claims Renacci supports tax breaks for millionaires like himself and "tried to avoid paying taxes on nearly $14 million that he made." "We play by the rules but Renacci thinks he’s above them," says a male blue collar worker shown in Sutton’s ad. On the same day that Sutton unveiled the ad that accuses Renacci of avoiding taxes, the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee made a similar assertion in a different ad, which says: "Renacci tried to skip out on paying over a million in taxes.". The tax avoidance claims in Sutton’s new ad echo charges that were raised against Renacci in 2010, when he first ran for Congress and defeated Democratic Rep. John Boccieri. They stem from a dispute Renacci had with the Ohio Department of Taxation, which accused him and his wife, Tina, of misreporting their income in 2000 and assessed them nearly $1.4 million in back taxes, interest and penalties. The Renaccis filed state tax returns that claimed they had a loss of $247,336 that year, but auditors determined they actually made $13,730,440. The couple filed a tax appeal when the state dinged them for $954,650 in back taxes, $146,938 in interest and $293,876 in penalties. The quarrel was over Renacci's trust income from an "S" corporation, which wasn’t taxable for several years before Ohio's tax commissioner changed the state’s policy. S corporations permit income to be taxed at an individual rate for federal tax purposes, and avoid double taxation on corporate income. Renacci was among a group of taxpayers who fought the state decision. He contended the trust income should have been tax-free and that he had "reasonable cause" to exclude it on his tax return, tax department and court documents say. Others dropped their appeals, but Renacci continued to fight, even after a 2006 Ohio Supreme Court ruling in a similar case in which the court said the trust income was subject to taxation. In that case, the taxpayers reported their S Corporation income on their 2000 tax return and then unsuccessfully asked for a refund. A 2007 legal brief the state of Ohio filed in Renacci’s case observed that nearly all other litigants "who created grantor trusts in an attempt to shelter, i.e., exclude their S corporation income from Ohio income taxation" gave up their appeals, and that the Renaccis were "almost alone in their persistence." Court records show the Renaccis eventually sent the state more than $1.3 million, but they continue to argue that $359,822 that they paid in penalties and interest were improper. "He was proud of his fight, and to have fought till the end, along with many other Ohioans for tax fairness," Renacci spokesman James Slepian told the Plain Dealer in 2010. When asked about Sutton’s new ad, Slepian this month called her "a desperate politician who knows she’s losing and has no record to run on," and said she’s engaging in "the bogus, gutter politics of recycled personal attacks that have defined her sad career in Congress." Indeed, the charges against Renacci are somewhat recycled. The American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees union placed a television ad in 2010 that contained a more extreme version of the charges that Sutton is making. That ad said he "cheated on his income taxes," that he "hid" more than $13 million and was forced to pay $1.4 million in back taxes and penalties. Renacci filed a defamation suit against the union after the ads began to air. Court records show he dropped the case on Feb. 3, 2011, shortly after he took office in Congress. PolitiFact Ohio found a claim in that ad to be Mostly True because Renacci could have disclosed the trust income on his state tax return, as the state warned he should, but he didn’t. He also could have paid the taxes and contested the amount, but didn’t. And he didn’t amend his return, despite an explicit 2002 warning from Ohio’s tax Department that he could face penalties for fraud and failure to pay if he didn’t. But Renacci ultimately worked within the system to resolve the case, paid the full amount that was due, and was not ever charged with tax fraud. The claim in this ad is an easier call. Reams of legal documents show that Renacci battled with the state over trust income from an S corporation, trying to avoid paying taxes on the $13.7 million at issue in the case. On the Truth-O-Meter, Sutton’s claim rates True.	None	Betty Sutton	None	None	None	2012-10-22T06:00:00	2012-10-17	['None']
pomt-03578	Says that according to a report, "the tech sector now drives more than one-quarter of Austin’s economy."	half-true	/texas/statements/2013/may/17/barack-obama/barack-obama-says-austins-tech-sector-drives-more-/	Austin rocks, President Barack Obama indicated during his May 9, 2013, swing through the area, thanks in great part to its technology-related businesses. After listing plans by Apple, Visa and General Motors to add jobs, Obama told students and teachers assembled at the Manor New Tech High School: "According to one report, the tech sector now drives more than one-quarter of Austin’s economy. And all of this has helped to make Austin one of the fastest-growing cities in America." We know tech is big in these parts, but does it drive more than a quarter of Austin’s economy? By email, White House spokesman Bobby Whithorne pointed out a press release issued earlier in May by the Austin Technology Council, a trade association for companies working in and around technology and life sciences. The release said the council had released results of its "Technology Economic Impact Report" finding that "technology is generating billions of dollars annually and driving more than a quarter of Austin's local economy." But the May 6, 2013, report doesn’t exactly say that, though it quantifies the area’s tech boom in various ways. The report says: "While a respectable 9% of total employment is in technology (more than 100,000 jobs), more than one third of all jobs in the Austin economy are supported by the technology sector, including direct hiring and spin-off hiring activity." Reference No. 2: "The sector accounts for a whopping 21% of Central Texas’ gross regional product (GRP) and contributes $21 (billion) in direct value to the local economy." Researcher Brian Kelsey later told us by email that the government sector swept in about 12 percent of local output. The council put us in touch with Brian Kelsey, a principal at Austin-based Civic Analytics, which conducted the research behind the report. By email, Kelsey told us the president’s claim is true if one assumes he was talking about Austin tech’s share of jobs plus spin-off jobs. For the research, Kelsey said, he defined Austin’s "tech sector" starting from the "high-tech" definition in TechAmerica Foundation’s annual "Cyberstates" publication. Its list encompasses 52 industries, among them communications equipment such as radio and TV broadcasting and wireless communications equipment; software services; engineering services; computer training; and space and defense systems. Kelsey said his firm added another industry, computer and computer peripheral equipment and software merchant wholesalers, "which captures a significant portion of business activity at some of Austin's larger companies such as Dell, IBM, etc." All told, Kelsey said, the 53 industries "contribute an estimated $20.9 billion to Austin's total Gross Regional Product," meaning the economic output in the five-county metropolitan region, "of approximately $97.4 billion, or roughly 21 percent, a bit under ‘one-quarter.’" Kelsey said total estimated employment (full-time, part-time, and self-employment) in Austin's tech sector accounted for 105,667 jobs in 2012, roughly 9 percent of all jobs in Austin. "That's direct jobs--i.e. people employed in the 53 industries. If you look at the direct employment and the spin-off activity it creates in other industries (the multiplier effect), the tech sector supports an estimated one-third of total employment in Austin--so a bit more than ‘one-quarter,’" he said. He added that most of the data behind the report, including the jobs multiplier of 3.5, came from Idaho-based Economic Modeling Specialists Intl., a company that specializes in economic impact studies. Finally, we asked Jon Hockenyos, president of Austin-based TXP, Inc., an economic consulting firm, to look over the council’s study. Hockenyos said by email that the results looked accurate. Regarding Obama’s reference, Hockenyos said: "I’d say the verb ‘drives’ (which to me implies more than the direct effect) makes the president’s remark consistent with the study’s findings." By telephone, the White House’s Whithorne stood by Obama’s wording, saying it was supported by the press release announcing the study and the study itself. Our ruling Obama said a report says the "tech sector now drives more than one quarter of Austin’s economy." The cited report doesn't directly declare this, estimating instead that high-tech companies in the Austin region directly supplied about 9 percent of the area’s jobs in 2012 and accounted for roughly 21 percent of the region's economic output. Then again, the report also says jobs in the tech sector plus spin-off jobs amounted to more than a third of the region’s total jobs, which strikes us as sufficient to make Obama's claim partly accurate. We rate it as Half True.	None	Barack Obama	None	None	None	2013-05-17T06:00:00	2013-05-09	['None']
pomt-13721	"We moved 100 times as many people out of poverty as moved out when President (Ronald) Reagan was in office, with 40 percent more jobs."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/jul/27/bill-clinton/bill-clinton-says-more-people-moved-out-poverty-un/	A video introducing Bill Clinton before the Democratic National Convention showcased the former president’s accomplishments during his terms in office, from 23 million jobs created to a budget surplus to the signing of the Family and Medical Leave Act. "His actions have changed millions of lives for the better," a narrator says. Clinton appears in the video saying, "We moved 100 times as many people out of poverty as moved out when President (Ronald) Reagan was in office, with 40 percent more jobs." That "100 times" feat sounded familiar. Clinton himself said it before in an October 2014 campaign stop in Milwaukee for Wisconsin gubernatorial candidate Mary Burke. Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton also said it in July 2014 in an interview on PBS’ The Charlie Rose Show. Hillary Clinton’s campaign guided us to reports that used Census poverty data to analyze the statement. If you crunch the numbers from the presidents’ first years to their last full year in office, they support Bill Clinton’s statement. But if you look at the numbers from the year they took office (1993 for Clinton and 1981 for Reagan) to the year they left office, the ratio is a lot smaller. For context: Clinton was elected in 1992 and served from January 1993 to January 2001. Reagan, a Republican elected in 1980, served from January 1981 to January 1989. Poverty changes from first year to last full year in office When Clinton took office in 1993, there were about 39.3 million people in poverty. By his last full year (2000), there were about 31.6 million -- a difference of 7.7 million people. When Reagan stepped into office in 1981, there were about 31.82 million people in poverty, by his last full year (1988), there were about 31.74 million -- a change of 77,000 people. So, using these sets of years, it does show that 100 times as many people moved out of poverty during Clinton’s administration compared to Reagan’s. However, when we calculate for years they took office to the years they left office, the numbers don’t show a "100 times" change. For Clinton, about 6.3 million moved out of poverty, for Reagan, 294,000. That’s a difference of about 21 times. While these numbers give us an insight into how many people are living in poverty, economists have told us it’s hard to say how many people actually move out of poverty. Someone who is making just $1 above the poverty threshold may still be struggling and not feel out of poverty. Jobs created The second part of Clinton’s statement says his presidency created 40 percent more jobs than Reagan’s. During Clinton’s tenure, 22.9 million jobs were created, an increase of 21 percent over the eight-year period. When Reagan was president, 16.1 million jobs were created, or an increase of 18 percent over the eight-year period. Overall, then, Clinton’s job-creation total was 42 percent higher than Reagan’s was -- 16.1 million for Reagan vs. 22.9 million for Clinton. It’s important to note that Reagan became president as the country was in a recession, and Clinton took office as the economy was bouncing back. Our ruling On the second night of the Democratic National Convention, Clinton said, "We moved 100 times as many people out of poverty as moved out when President Reagan was in office, with 40 percent more jobs." Part of Clinton’s statement (moved 100 times as many out of poverty compared to Reagan) is accurate when analyzed from years presidents took office to last full years in office, but can be incorrect when interpreted from year they took office to the year they left. Also, there was a 40 percent increase in jobs created from Reagan’s terms to Clinton’s. We rate Clinton’s statement Half True.https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/5d3d6c3d-efb0-4574-9380-455ad4991f5d	None	Bill Clinton	None	None	None	2016-07-27T20:45:09	2016-07-26	['Ronald_Reagan']
pomt-03749	"Right now, Texas doesn’t have an income tax and Oklahoma’s lowering their income tax rates, and guess what their severance tax is? Sky high."	true	/ohio/statements/2013/apr/08/john-kasich/john-kasich-says-oklahoma-texas-have-sky-high-taxe/	Gov. John Kasich pitched several changes to Ohio’s tax structure in his budget proposal for fiscal 2014-2015 that would, in part, allow reductions in the state’s individual income tax. Among those proposals was an increase to the state’s severance tax, a tax levied on oil and gas resources when they are extracted -- or severed -- from the ground. The change would target large producers engaged in horizontal drilling and raise an estimated $45 million in fiscal 2014 and $155 million in fiscal 2015. Kasich often has said the tax is too low. As energy companies tap oil and natural gas resources in the resource-rich Utica Shale formation in eastern Ohio, the governor has argued Ohio should reap a greater reward from nature’s bounty. While in the Mahoning Valley on March 21, the governor touted his budget plans, including the severance tax increase, to the Youngstown-Warren Regional Chamber of Commerce, and again in an interview with a Youngstown television station. "Right now, Texas doesn’t have an income tax and Oklahoma’s lowering their income tax rates, and guess what their severance tax is? Sky high," Kasich told the interviewer. PolitiFact Ohio decided to check the governor’s claim. We started with the first part of his claim about Texas and Oklahoma and income taxes. We quickly confirmed that Texas, indeed, does not have a state income tax. Oklahoma has a state income tax with seven brackets for individual incomes. The income thresholds for the brackets are grouped closely together, with the top taxing bracket kicking in for income over $15,000 a year. The median household income for the state for 2007-2011 was slightly below $44,300 a year, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. The rate for the top bracket for tax year for tax filers this year is $395 plus 5.25 percent of the amount over $15,000. That rate reflects a tax reduction of 0.25 percent from the previous year. So Kasich appears to be correct about the state income tax rates. But what about the two states’ taxes on oil and gas resources? Are they, as the governor said, " sky high"? "Sky high" isn’t quantifiable. But we can look at how Texas and Oklahoma compare with other states, including Ohio. That picture, though, is somewhat muddied as the manner in which oil and natural gas production is taxed varies from state to state. Data from the National Conference of State Legislatures showed, though, that the taxes for 2012 in Oklahoma and Texas, while not the highest, were among the national leaders. Texas charges a 7.5-percent tax on the market value of natural gas. Oklahoma charges 7 percent on the market value, with provisions that reduce the rate if the price per thousand cubic feet (MCF) falls below $2.10. That has happened in just two months since 2000, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. Texas collects a 4.6-percent tax on oil’s market value . Oklahoma collects 7 percent, with provisions for the tax to drop if the price per barrel falls below $17. The price of West Texas Intermediate crude oil hasn’t been that low in more than 10 years at Cushing, Okla., a major trading hub for crude oil. It has been above $90 per barrel all this year. How does that compare to other states? The NCSL data showed that gas taxes for both states are in the top 10, as was Oklahoma’s tax on oil. Texas’ oil tax was lower, but it also has the highest production, by far. In 2010, Texas accounted for nearly 26 percent of domestic oil production, more than double No. 2 Alaska. Ohio’s rates, by contrast, are much lower. Natural gas is taxed at 3 cents per MCF. The governor has proposed it be increased to 1 percent of the value of the gas extracted via horizontal wells. So, for example, if the average price is $3.35 per MCF at the wellhead, as the U.S. Energy Information Administration listed for December, the state would collect 3.35 cents per MCF, rather than the 3 cents at Ohio’s current rate. The collection would rise as the price of gas rises. Oil is taxed at 20 cents per barrel. Kasich’s proposal would increase that tax for horizontal wells to 1.5 percent of the price per barrel initially and to 4 percent after one year. So if oil commands a price of $90 per barrel, the state tax would generate $1.35 per barrel initially and $3.60 after the first year, rather than the 20 cents per barrel at Ohio’s current rate. Kasich spokesman Rob Nichols said the governor’s point was that the taxes are "sky high" when compared to Ohio. And because oil and gas are exported out of those states, he said, the tax burden is also exported. "Not all oil drilled in Texas is consumed in Texas," he said. "Other states are exporting their tax costs to us. His proposal would allow Ohio to do the same." Kasich’s description of income taxes in Texas (none) and Oklahoma (reduced) was correct. As for the other part of his claim, while "sky high" is somewhat subjective, the reality of the tax structure now is that the significantly higher tax rates on gas and oil in Texas and Oklahoma, when compared to Ohio, can generate revenues that are -- well -- sky high. Texas and Oklahoma are among the leaders for natural gas, but not tops. Oklahoma also has one of the highest oil rates. And at current prices, Texas’ tax on oil, the lower of the two states, would yield more than 20 times what Ohio’s current per-barrel tax raises. On the Truth-O-Meter, Kasich’s claim rates True.

pomt-10913	"SHOCK REPORT: Senator McCaskill BUSTED Funneling Millions of Tax Dollars to Her Hubby."	mostly false	/punditfact/statements/2018/aug/01/blog-posting/misleading-headline-suggests-mccaskill-personally-/	A recent clickbait headline claimed Sen. Claire McCaskill, D-Mo., was "busted" for routing millions of tax dollars into the pocket of her husband, business investor Joseph Shepard. Affordable housing projects in which Shepard has invested have received millions in federal subsidies during McCaskill’s two terms in office. But this headline spins the narrative in a way that could mislead readers — by making Shepard’s business success appear more nefarious than what has been reported. "Shock report: Senator McCaskill busted funneling millions of tax dollars to her hubby," said a July 25 headline from Patriot Beat, a conservative website. The story quoted directly from a Breitbart News article, which in turn cited original reporting from the Kansas City Star. This story was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) "Well, well, well, with a tight election coming up, Senator Claire McCaskill does not need a ‘scandal’ to crop up," the Patriot Beat story said above its repost of the Breitbart News story. "However, that’s precisely what’s happened — and it’s a doozy … According to a new report, McCaskill has funneled her husband $131 million in federal subsidies." While the Breitbart story relies on the Kansas City Star report, the Kansas City Star’s research does not support the implications embedded in the inflammatory Patriot Beat headline. Its loaded words, such as "busted" and "funneling," paint what could very well be a total coincidence as a deliberate attempt by McCaskill to profit off of taxpayer money. Other headlines — such as the Kansas City Star’s "Businesses linked to McCaskill’s husband get $131 million in federal dollars" — were more precise. Here’s what actually happened. A July 24 analysis from the Kansas City Star revealed that businesses linked to Shepard have received approximately $131 million in federal subsidies since McCaskill took office in 2007. Specifically, government-subsidized housing projects in which Shepard has invested were awarded $62 million and $69 million during McCaskill’s first and second terms, respectively. The businesses Shepard has invested in participate in affordable housing programs through both the U.S. Department of Agriculture and the Department of Housing and Urban Development. The USDA program subsidizes low-cost rental housing in rural areas for domestic farm laborers and low-income, disabled or elderly people. The federal subsidies compensate property owners on behalf of tenants who otherwise would not be capable of affording their full rent. Meanwhile, the HUD program contractually obligates private landlords and developers to reserve some housing units for cheap rental, and the subsidies again help to pay off part of the rent. Although Shepard gets only a fraction of each federal award as income — most of each subsidy contributes to covering operating costs for the projects — the Kansas City Star report noted that his personal income grew during McCaskill’s two terms in the Senate, from between $1,608 and $16,731 in 2006 to between $365,374 and $1,118,158 in 2017. According to the Kansas City Star’s analysis, "a growing percentage of Shepard’s personal earnings come from new businesses he has invested in that are receiving federal awards, primarily rural rental assistance through the USDA." The Kansas City Star also made clear, however, that there is "no evidence that McCaskill played any part in directing federal funds to businesses affiliated with her husband." McCaskill has voted for some omnibus spending bills that would have benefited affordable housing programs, but she has voted against others. She also does not sit on the Senate committees with jurisdiction over HUD and USDA, where she could have had more influence. Additionally, the Kansas City Star report noted that Shepard is now just a limited partner with most of the federally subsidized housing projects in which he invests. This means that he does not control day-to-day operations or the distribution of profits. The report also specified that Shepard’s investments in affordable housing predated his 2002 marriage with McCaskill. A spokesman for Shepard’s company, Sugar Creek, told the Kansas City Star that the company is involved with fewer government housing projects now than before Shepard married. Similar articles detailing subsidies provided to Shepard’s businesses also surfaced in 2012. "Claire's work in the Senate has absolutely nothing to do with her husband's business investments," said Meira Bernstein, McCaskill campaign spokeswoman. Patriot Beat did not respond to a request for comment. Our ruling A misleading headline said, "Shock report: Senator McCaskill busted funneling millions of tax dollars to her hubby." The article cited research from a credible newspaper — the Kansas City Star — showing that since McCaskill took office, her husband has seen his income increase at least in part because of federal subsidies awarded to housing projects that he has invested in. However, we found no evidence that McCaskill personally or deliberately routed any money to her husband’s businesses. The use of the words "busted" and "funneling" in the Patriot Beat headline is not supported by the Kansas City Star’s research. We rate this statement Mostly False.

pomt-13154	Says FBI Director James Comey’s letter about new developments in the investigation into her emails "only" went "to Republican members of the House."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/oct/30/hillary-clinton/clinton-wrongly-says-fbi-director-sent-letter-abou/	Hillary Clinton has called on FBI Director James Comey to make public any information he has on recent developments into the agency’s investigation into her emails. Comey sent a letter to Congress Oct. 28 saying the FBI may have found new emails relevant to its probe into Clinton’s private email server that she used while secretary of state. The FBI plans to review these new emails to see if they contain classified information. Back in July, Comey said the FBI recommended that no charges be brought in this case. With just over a week to go until the Nov. 8 election, the Clinton campaign has said they are concerned that Comey’s vague letter will fuel unfounded rumors about the email investigation, so he should make available any additional information the FBI has. "We've made it very clear that, if they are going to be sending this kind of letter that is only going originally to Republican members of the House, that they need to share whatever facts they claim to have with the American people," Clinton said at an Oct. 28 press conference. "And that's what I expect to happen." Clinton was incorrect to say that the letter "only" went to Republican members of the House of Representatives. Democrat members received the letter, too. The letter was addressed at the top to the chairmen of various congressional committees, who are all currently Republican because the party controls both the Senate and the House. But the second page of the letter indicates that Comey also circulated the letter to ranking Democrats on those committees, as well. You can see the full letter for yourself here. The Clinton campaign said she misspoke. Our ruling Clinton said Comey’s letter about new developments in the investigation into her emails "only" went "to Republican members of the House." Republican and Democratic members of the House and Senate received this letter.

pomt-03971	"We have a governor who's vetoed measures like increasing our minimum wage and restoring the earned income tax cut."	mostly true	/new-jersey/statements/2013/feb/14/john-wisniewski/chris-christie-vetoed-bills-raise-minimum-wage-and/	As state Sen. Barbara Buono kicked off her campaign to unseat Gov. Chris Christie, state Democratic Party Chairman John Wisniewski said she had a record on which to run. That record, he said, belongs to the Republican governor. With supporters holding up Buono signs behind him, Wisniewski sounded off on Christie’s tenure during a Feb. 2 campaign kickoff rally at New Brunswick High School. Buono forms the "perfect contrast" to Christie, said Wisniewski, a state assemblyman from Middlesex County. "We have a governor who’s vetoed measures like increasing our minimum wage and restoring the Earned Income Tax Cut," Wisniewski said, eliciting boos from the crowd. The assemblyman’s charges are pretty solid. By different means, Christie has vetoed bills to raise the minimum wage and to increase the Earned Income Tax Credit after reducing that benefit in his first state budget. But Wisniewski’s statement ignores the fact Christie also has offered alternatives to both. First, let’s talk about the minimum wage. In late 2012, the Democrat-controlled Legislature passed a bill to increase the hourly minimum wage from $7.25 to $8.50 and implement annual cost-of-living increases. But on Jan. 28, Christie conditionally vetoed the legislation and recommended certain changes, including scrapping cost-of-living increases and phasing in over three years a $1 increase. Democrats have rejected that plan and vowed to ask voters in November to amend the state Constitution with a minimum wage hike tied to annual cost-of-living increases. Now, we’ll address the Earned Income Tax Credit for low-income residents who work. As part of the fiscal year 2011 budget, the state tax credit was reduced from 25 percent to 20 percent of the federal amount. That reduction began with tax year 2010. The Legislature passed a bill in June 2011 to restore the credit to the original 25 percent figure, but Christie later vetoed the bill without proposing any changes. In June 2012, Christie vetoed a second bill to restore the credit. However, around the same time, he offered to restore the credit as part of a plan to provide an income tax cut That proposal was outlined in Christie’s conditional veto of a separate bill that would have raised the income tax rate on taxable income of more than $1 million. The Legislature has not acted on the governor’s proposal. More recently, Christie agreed to increase the tax credit as part of his conditional veto on the minimum wage bill. So, while it’s correct the governor vetoed two bills to restore the Earned Income Tax Credit, he also has offered at least two proposals that included increasing the tax credit. Alicia D’Alessandro, a spokeswoman for Wisniewski, said in an e-mail that the governor’s alternative proposals are not worth acknowledging. "The conditions attached to his vetoes undercut the purpose of the bills and do not even merit acknowledgement," she said. "In what world would the Democratic state chairman give credit to the Republican governor for ‘alternative measures’ that were clearly offered only for show? "Anyone who believes that would happen at a campaign rally must think this election is happening in Fantasyland." Our ruling At a campaign rally for Buono, Wisniewski said: "We have a governor who’s vetoed measures like increasing our minimum wage and restoring the earned income tax cut." Wisniewski is right about those vetoes. Christie conditionally vetoed a bill to raise the state’s minimum wage and issued absolute vetoes on two bills to increase the Earned Income Tax Credit. But the governor has offered alternatives to increase the minimum wage and restore the tax credit to its previous level. We rate the statement Mostly True. To comment on this ruling, go to NJ.com.

pomt-01516	"Last week's three most-viewed television programs were Sunday Night Football, Thursday Night Football and Monday Night Football."	true	/punditfact/statements/2014/sep/21/george-will/george-will-top-3-shows-us-last-week-were-nfl-game/	Not even the Ray Rice scandal could yank professional football games from the top of television viewership rankings, said conservative commentator George Will. Will participated in a Fox News Sunday political panel dissecting the NFL’s response to the video showing Rice, a former Baltimore Ravens running back, assaulting his now-wife in an elevator. NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell’s performance has been widely criticized, but Will predicted he will survive the scandal. Why? America’s real pastime is an economic behemoth that can’t be stopped. "Last week’s three most-viewed television programs were Sunday Night Football, Thursday Night Football and Monday Night Football," he said. "And money talks and it will continue to talk. And this will pass over, and football will go on its merry way." It’s no secret that professional football has a big TV audience. We wanted to know just how big. By the numbers To check Will’s claim we looked to a top-10 ranking of shows by the Nielsen Company, which tracks consumer trends, including television viewership, from the week of Monday, Sept. 8, through Sunday, Sept. 14. It is the most-recent week available. That Monday, TMZ released a video showing Rice punching his now-wife in an elevator. On the same day, the Baltimore Ravens terminated their contract with Rice, and Goodell announced that Rice was on indefinite suspension. Later in the week, the Associated Press reported that NFL executives were supposedly aware of this video months earlier. Nielsen has separate top-10 lists for broadcast television and cable television. Because Monday Night Football appears on ESPN, we decided to combine the lists into one overall ranking. Here are the top 10 shows and their viewership (in millions) that week: 1. NBC Sunday Night Football (22.1) 2. CBS Thursday Night Football (20.8) 3. NBC Sunday Night NFL Pre-Kick show (16.7) 4. CBS NFL Thursday Night Pre-Kick show (13.9) 5. ESPN Monday Night Football - New York/Detroit (13.7) 6. CBS 60 Minutes (12.3) 7. NBC Football Night in America (12.4) 8. ESPN Monday Night Football - San Diego/Arizona (11.5) 9. CBS NFL Thursday Night Kickoff (10.6) 10. CBS America’s Got Talent (10.5) As you can see, there’s a lot of love for professional football. Americans don’t just love the games -- they love the pregame shows, too. The popularity of the pregame shows on NBC and CBS pushed the Monday Night Football game between the New York Giants and Detroit Lions to No. 5. So Will’s comment, by Nielsen’s metrics, is a tad off. Still, the point holds: Pro football games and pre- and post-game analysis dominated 8 out of 10 of the top 10 shows. Only CBS’ America’s Got Talent and 60 Minutes cracked the list. Of course, excitement for NFL games is high since the season started just a couple weeks ago, and the networks’ fall television programming hasn’t fully kicked in just yet. Even so, NFL games and analysis will continue to dominate the rankings as the season goes on, said Marc Berman, editor-in-chief of TV Media Insights, in an interview with PunditFact. When new shows begin to air, the number of "households using television" goes up, but they don’t take viewers away from football, Berman said. The popularity of the teams playing and whether the game is exciting have a bigger effect on football viewership ratings. Numerous Nielsen statistics show professional football’s seemingly permanent first-place spot. In the 2013-14 season, NBC’s Sunday Night Football was the most-watched primetime show, with 21.7 million average viewers. ESPN’s Monday Night Football was the No. 1 most-viewed cable television show in 2013. The NFL holds 34 of the 35 most-watched individual shows in the fall of 2013. (The odd one out was NBC’s Macy’s Thanksgiving Parade at No. 22.) And in four of the past five years, the Super Bowl has broken the record for the most-watched television event in history. Professional football stands out from other sports, said Dan Lebowitz, executive director of Northeastern University’s Center for the Study of Sports and Society. In football, there are only 16 games in a typical season -- as opposed to baseball’s 162 games and basketball’s 82 games -- so each game becomes a major event. The rise of fantasy football has further solidified the sport’s popularity, Lebowitz said. The scandals involving Rice and other NFL standouts can’t make even a small dent in this trend because of football’s widespread popularity and importance in American culture, Berman said. "Football will outlive all of us," he said. Our ruling Will said, "Last week’s three most-viewed television programs were Sunday Night Football, Thursday Night Football and Monday Night Football." Football games and related programming accounted for eight of the top 10 most-viewed TV programs between Sept. 8-14, 2014. Even though Monday Night Football came in fifth, not third, Will was right to say that football dominated the rankings. Experts say it will continue to do just that. We rate this claim True.

pomt-07648	"Georgia still has one of the richest programs in terms of scholarships for students to go to college."	true	/georgia/statements/2011/mar/15/nathan-deal/deal-says-hope-revamp-still-good-students/	Gov. Nathan Deal made an interesting claim during a defense of his plan to overhaul the popular HOPE college scholarship program. "Georgia still has one of the richest programs in terms of scholarships for students to go to college," Deal said in a recent radio interview. We wondered about that, particularly as the governor is expected to sign a bill Tuesday that will make significant changes to HOPE in an effort to keep the scholarship program on solid financial footing. The program is funded through Georgia Lottery proceeds, and revenue is flat. The state spent nearly $150 million out of $1 billion reserves to cover HOPE in the 2010 fiscal year, and if no changes are made, it will need to spend more than $500 million from reserves for this fiscal year and next, according to a recent article by The Atlanta Journal-Constitution’s Laura Diamond. Georgia Senate Democrats proposed an alternative plan that would give a full scholarship to high-achieving students whose families earn up to $140,000 a year. That plan would increase deposits to education programs by 2 percent. Democrats argued the GOP’s HOPE proposal would be unfair to poor and rural students. The Republican-led Senate voted against the alternative plan. "HOPE will be the richest program because the HOPE scholarship will only be available for the richest people," Senate Democratic Leader Robert Brown of Macon said in a statement. "These changes will help the students who need HOPE the least and hurt the students who need it the most." Deal spokesman Brian Robinson said with the changes in the plan the governor supports, Georgia would have a projected $507 million for HOPE scholarships and grants and $54 million for private college awards during the next school year. For the past 40 years, the National Association of State Student Grant and Aid Programs has kept track of how much money each state awards in post-secondary education scholarships and grants. The association is made up of state college funding officials from all 50 states. Other organizations, such as the College Board, the post-secondary educational program that administers the SAT exam, suggested we reach out to NASSGAP to get the best data on this subject. Georgia awarded nearly $567 million in total grant aid during the 2008-09 school year, ranking fourth in the nation behind California, New York and Florida, according to the association. Divide that total by the number of students enrolled in undergraduate programs, and Georgia ranked only behind South Carolina, the most recent report found. Georgia handed out an estimated average of $1,712 to each undergraduate student. South Carolina awarded $1,916 per student. California, Florida and New York have far more undergraduate students than Georgia, while South Carolina had only half the number of students that Georgia had in undergraduate programs. California awarded $537 per undergraduate student. Florida and New York awarded $924 and $1,015, respectively, per undergraduate student. Frank Ballmann, the federal liaison for NASSGAP, said many states are facing the same sorts of financial challenges that Deal and many state leaders say necessitates the funding changes to HOPE. But even with those changes to HOPE, Ballmann believes Georgia will remain one of the leaders nationally in terms of the amount of money per student it gives out for scholarships and grants. "Generally speaking, Georgia is still doing very well," Ballmann said. "I think even with the cuts Georgia is going to be in the top five. Depending on what the other states do, Georgia may remain No. 2." The numbers here seem clear on this one. Georgia is one of the top five states in terms of awarding grants and scholarships. NASSGAP’s Ballmann believes that won’t change. Being in the top five certainly qualifies it as "one of the richest," as the governor said. We rate Deal’s claim as True.

As the NFL season kicks off, false news stories are circulating on social media related to the ongoing controversy of players protesting during the playing of the national anthem. We’ve recently fact-checked two other stories that originated on America’s Last Line of Defense websites. We rated both Pants on Fire. In 2016, Colin Kaepernick, then a San Francisco 49ers quarterback, started kneeling during the national anthem before games to protest the treatment of people of color in the United States. "I am not going to stand up to show pride in a flag for a country that oppresses black people and people of color," Kaepernick told NFL Media in 2016. "To me, this is bigger than football and it would be selfish on my part to look the other way. There are bodies in the street and people getting paid leave and getting away with murder." The Miami Dolphins considered penalizing or firing players who kneeled during the anthem this summer. Shortly after the Associated Press reported on the potential penalties, the NFL and the NFL Players Association announced they would not be issuing or enforcing new rules related to the anthem. The NFL is not expected to implement a new national anthem policy this season. While several Miami Dolphins have knelt during preseason games this year, none of them share the names of the players in the article, and no one was fired or penalized. Miami Dolphins wide receivers Kenny Stills and Albert Wilson knelt during the national anthem during the Sept. 9 season opener against the Tennessee Titans, eight days after the article's claim was made. They have not been penalized as of deadline for this story. We rate this claim Pants on Fire.

The radio spot by a group representing roadbuilding firms features a stat that’s a world apart from RBI or ERA or WHIP. The ad’s opening pitch says: "Improving Wisconsin’s roads and highways is critical to reducing accidents and keeping our families safe." Then the payoff pitch: "In fact, Milwaukee’s Marquette Interchange is a shining example of those successes. Accidents are down 50 percent and injury accidents are down 60 percent." All-star numbers, if true. The $800 million rebuilding of the Marquette, in the heart of downtown Milwaukee, was a huge traffic story from 2004 until the work was completed in 2008. Since then, Milwaukee has moved on to other mega-highway renovation projects, including the $1.7 billion Zoo Interchange and the re-decking of the Hoan Bridge. Statewide, a glut of highway projects has led to concern that Gov. Scott Walker’s budget seeks too much borrowing for roadbuilding. The Legislature is reviewing options. In the Marquette, the old cloverleaf was having trouble handling increasing traffic. Motorists had to crisscross lanes to reach exits. Key components were falling apart and accidents were topping 600 a year. The reconstruction didn’t solve all the design puzzles in the busy interchange. Changes were needed in 2010 to slow traffic on the long curve tying I-94 eastbound to I-43 northbound after the Milwaukee County Sheriff’s Office and others raised concerns about accident rates. In 2012, DOT had to make adjustments after backups and long delays plagued westbound I-794 in the Marquette. But what about the overall claim? Did the reconstruction add up to the big safety improvements claimed by the Wisconsin Transportation Builders Association? What the numbers show Pat Goss and Kevin Traas from the group pointed us to the state Department of Transportation, which collects data on reported accidents from local law enforcement agencies. The association cited a DOT chart comparing the average number of crashes annually in the three years before the rebuild (2001-2003) to the first three years after (2009-2011). It showed annual crashes down 48.2 percent, and injury or fatal crashes down 60 percent. By the numbers, that’s 365 fewer reported accidents every year, and 143 fewer per year involving injuries. So those figures generally back up the group’s claim, albeit by rounding up from 48 percent to 50 percent. Newer figures The numbers are out of date though, so we obtained five years of accident data from before and after the construction period. Those figures run through 2013. There’s a caveat: The boundaries used for the interchange were somewhat different in DOT’s five-year comparison than in the three-year comparison. But they help confirm the trends. They also show a big drop in total accidents, though not quite as sharp: 45 percent for total accidents, and 55 percent for injury accidents. The cumulative accident count from 1999-2003: 3,416. The same count from 2009-2013: 1,890. For injury accidents in the five-year comparison, there were 561 fewer in the five years after the rebuilding. Michael Pyritz, DOT spokesman for the southeast region, attributed the improvement in accident rates to several factors. The new interchange made exiting safer and improved sight lines while incorporating modern safety and efficiency designs, he said. "We expect to see the same trend when the Zoo Interchange is done," Pyritz said. As a double check on the DOT data, we got crash figures from the Milwaukee County Sheriff’s Office, which responds to most accidents in the Marquette Interchange. That data showed somewhat smaller, but still significant, declines in accidents. For example, comparing the three years before the project (2001-2003) vs. the latest three years (2012-2014), accidents are down 45 percent and injury accidents 49 percent, according to the Sheriff’s Department. The two agencies defined the interchange somewhat differently. By another measure -- the three years before rebuilding vs. the first three years after (2009-2011) -- the Sheriff’s Office found 27 percent and 32 percent drops in total accidents and injury crashes, respectively. That same comparison using the DOT data yielded the 48 percent and 60 percent drops. There’s a large discrepancy in which the Sheriff’s Office shows far fewer injury accidents before the project than are reported in the DOT figures. Sheriff’s officials said a changeover in data collection methods, and late reporting of injuries by crash victims, likely explains some of the discrepancy. Still, even with that, both agencies show a clear drop in accidents. One final note: more traffic could also explain the higher numbers of accidents before the reconstruction. But DOT data we reviewed on its website suggests that traffic volumes were not significantly higher, if higher at all, back then. In the broad view, after 30 years of steady increases, miles traveled on state highways leveled off in 2000 and have not budged much. On I-94, which feeds the Marquette, a DOT study reported a 5 percent increase eastbound from the Brewers ballpark from 1989 to 2009. All that might suggest that volume in the Marquette after the rebuild is roughly the same or higher than it was before construction. Our rating The Wisconsin Transportation Builders Association radio ad contended that "accidents are down 50 percent and injury accidents are down 60 percent" since the redesign of the Marquette Interchange in Milwaukee. There are different ways to slice this, but the ad cites official state data that is backed up within a few percentage points by more recent figures, and is generally confirmed by local data. We rate the claim True.	None	Wisconsin Transportation Builders Association	None	None	None	2015-05-24T21:00:00	2015-05-13	['Milwaukee']
pomt-06820	"George LeMieux voted against the majority of Republicans and joined with Democrats to create a 'Task Force For Responsible Fiscal Action' that looks strikingly similar to the 'Super Committee' now being set up in Washington to justify massive tax hikes."	half-true	/florida/statements/2011/aug/10/adam-hasner/adam-hasner-says-george-lemieux-voted-against-his-/	As Adam Hasner and George LeMieux debate each other's conservative credentials in the race to take on Democratic U.S. Sen. Bill Nelson, Hasner's team has picked over LeMieux's brief time in the U.S. Senate looking for signs of weakness — er, uh, moderate leanings. The joys of primary politics. Thus, a Hasner news release from Aug. 8, 2011 -- the week after Congress voted to raise the debt ceiling and avoid default -- accuses LeMieux of being "for tax-raising committees before he was against them." It begins: "After weeks of equivocation and avoidance of the debt crisis in Washington, Senator George LeMieux finally tweeted his displeasure in the closing hours of the debate. But while serving as Charlie Crist's handpicked U.S. Senator, George LeMieux voted against the majority of Republicans and joined with Democrats to create a 'Task Force For Responsible Fiscal Action' that looks strikingly similar to the 'Super Committee' now being set up in Washington to justify massive tax hikes." And concludes: "Time and time again, Senator LeMieux's record shows he was willing to be a token Republican vote for the Democrats, and his vote to create a tax-raising task force proves it." Consider us intrigued. In just part of a sentence — "George LeMieux voted against the majority of Republicans and joined with Democrats to create a 'Task Force For Responsible Fiscal Action' that looks strikingly similar to the 'Super Committee' now being set up in Washington to justify massive tax hikes" — we saw three issues worth a look. • Did LeMieux vote against most Republicans and with Democrats to create a Task Force for Responsible Fiscal Action? • Was that task force proposal "strikingly similar" to the Joint Committee on Deficit Reduction, sometimes called the "supercommittee," created by the Budget Control Act of 2011? • Is the supercommittee being "set up ... to justify massive tax hikes"? We'll note that LeMieux did indeed tweet unhappily on Aug. 1, 2011, saying the, "Debt deal offers no significant debt reduction & no fundamental reforms to solve DC's spending addiction" and linking to a short post on his website that the debt deal was "no time for celebration." Did LeMieux vote to create a Task Force for Responsible Fiscal Action? LeMieux's record of support for a bipartisan committee known as the "Task Force for Responsible Fiscal Action" is clear. He was one of 25 original co-sponsors of legislation in 2009 by Sens. Kent Conrad, D-N.D., and Judd Gregg, R-N.H., that would have created the task force. When it ultimately came up for a Senate vote as an amendment to an amendment to another bill in January 2010, the roll call at Senate.gov shows he voted for it. His "Yea" vote put him with about 40 percent of Republicans. The majority of his party colleagues voted against it. That supports Hasner's claim that he "voted against the majority of Republicans and joined with Democrats" to create the task force. But LeMieux wasn't exactly a "token Republican vote for the Democrats," as Hasner's team put it. Fifteen of LeMieux's Republican colleagues joined him. The Democrats were as divided as the Republicans, though more of them supported the plan. Meanwhile, the final 53-46 Senate vote — seven votes short of the 60 required — understates earlier Republican support for the task force. Senate Minority leader Mitch McConnell had called it the "best hope for addressing the out-of-control spending and debt levels that are threatening our nation's fiscal future." Then antitax activists attacked it for leaving the door open to tax increases, and President Barack Obama endorsed it the Saturday before the vote. Seven Republican co-sponsors withdrew their support. McConnell also voted against it, earning a Full Flop from PolitiFact. Which left LeMieux in his party's minority — but on a proposal with strong bipartisan roots. Was that task force proposal "strikingly similar" to the supercommittee? Hasner accuses LeMieux of a flip-flop, saying he was "for tax-raising committees before he was against them." But just how similar were the committees? In some key ways, they're the same. The supercommittee is "certainly a descendant of the task force and the many other similar type(s) of special mechanisms proposed to do the hard work Congress refuses to do," said Steve Ellis, vice president of Taxpayers for Common Sense, an independent group that analyzes federal spending. "... This is not a new idea." The committee proposals both include members appointed by Democrats and Republicans, seek ideas to reduce the "fiscal imbalance of the federal government" and require Congress to fast-track recommendations to a vote with no amendments. But LeMieux's campaign points out a key difference: The 12-member supercommittee created by Congress requires just simple majority votes — for example, a single Republican could join six Democrats to endorse a plan. Meanwhile, the task force he supported required supermajority votes both by an 18-member committee and by Congress to implement its recommendations. "This would have protected taxpayers since the commission's plan would have needed the support of at least four of the eight Republicans on the commission to guarantee a vote in the House and Senate," said campaign manager Brian Seitchik. "This would make it highly unlikely that the commission's plan would be able to get sufficient Republican support if it raised taxes." So, are the committees "strikingly similar"? Yes, but arguably with enough room for LeMieux to explain why he might vote for one, but not support the other. Task Force for Responsible Fiscal Action Joint Committee on Deficit Reduction Goal To provide recommendations and legislative language that will significantly improve the long-term fiscal imbalance of the federal government, which may include expenditures and revenues To reduce the deficit by at least $1.5 trillion from 2012-21, providing recommendations and legislative language that will significantly improve the short-term and long-term fiscal imbalance of the federal government Members 18 (10 Democrats, 8 Republicans) 12 (6 Democrats, 6 Republicans) Time before committee vote on recommendations 41 weeks 16 weeks Number of members required for passage 14 of 18 (78 percent) 7 of 12 (58 percent) Fast-tracking in House and Senate Yes Yes Amendments allowed No No Votes required to pass Congress Supermajority in each chamber Simple majority Is the supercommittee being "set up ... to justify massive tax hikes"? Now we get to the crux of Hasner's campaign message, that LeMieux supported "tax-raising" committees before he opposed them. Did Congress create the supercommittee "to justify massive tax hikes"? And was raising taxes the purpose of the earlier task force that LeMieux supported? Consider this a matter of vociferous debate. Neither the task force nor the supercommittee proposals require tax increases. The earlier task force plan explicitly allowed for the possibility, saying that recommendations may include expenditures and revenues. Meanwhile, the supercommittee legislation requires a $1.5 trillion reduction in the deficit but doesn't prescribe how to get there. Spending cuts? Tax increases? It's up to the committee, which doesn't have to be named until Aug. 16, 2011. In fact, depending on whom you talk to, tax increases are guaranteed, likely — or, in the case of the supercommittee, not even possible. Hasner's campaign cited a letter from antitax activist Grover Norquist, who opposed the earlier task force proposal. Norquist said that by relying on a committee that was not explicitly barred from raising taxes, tax hikes would occur. "Every Democrat on the commission would insist on tax increases to 'balance' spending cuts in the recommendation. There is no conceivable scenario whereby the commission would issue a report that does not contain tax hikes," he wrote. George F. Will made a similar argument about the tax force proposal LeMieux supported: "Substantively," he wrote, "the task force would be a means of conscripting Republican participation in huge tax increases." Ellis of Taxpayers for Common Sense disagrees with the premise that either committee was designed to justify tax increases. "That's irresponsible fear-mongering, which is similar to those on the left saying the committee was established to slash Social Security or Medicare," Ellis said. He points out that only half the senators who voted against the task force proposal were Republicans. "I don't think Sen. (Bernie) Sanders, I-Vt., was voting against the committee because he was afraid it would raise taxes," he said. Meanwhile, the supercommittee vote actually spawned days of debate about whether it would allow for tax increases at all, much less "massive" ones. (You can read some here: Sort of, Yes, Maybe) House Speaker John Boehner told his caucus it would effectively be impossible for the supercommittee to raise taxes. The White House disagreed. The debate turned on a technical question: How would $1.5 trillion in deficit reduction be calculated? Some said that, because the supercommittee legislation asks for estimates from the Congressional Budget Office, it would require using CBO's typical "current law" baseline — one that assumes the Bush tax cuts will expire in 2012 — as opposed to a "current policy" or "plausible" baseline that assumes that what's true now stays in place whether that requires an act of Congress or not. Others said the committee could request a different baseline. If a current law baseline were required, Democrats wouldn't get any credit toward the $1.5 trillion for stopping or limiting the Bush tax cuts, for example, which would be presumed gone. Even if they wanted to do it anyway, increasing tax rates would get sticky. "The practical effect of this is that the bipartisan committee will be unable to make any recommendations regarding the Bush-era tax cuts," wrote Nick Kasprak of the business-backed Tax Foundation. "For example, let's say the committee proposes, among other things, raising the top marginal tax rate 3 percentage points, from 35 percent to 38 percent, which would bring in some amount of revenue that counts towards their $1.5 trillion assignment. 'Hold on,' says the Congressional Budget Office, 'According to our current law baseline, that rate is set to go up to 39.6 percent in 2013 when the Bush-era tax cuts expire, so this is actually a tax cut, and it makes the deficit worse.' " One more curveball: If the supercommittee deadlocks, or Congress doesn't pass what it recommends, the Budget Control Act includes an automatic trigger to cut $1.5 trillion across the board, split evenly between defense and everything else, and protecting just Social Security, Medicaid and veterans benefits. That's right: No deal means just cuts. The ruling Hasner's team said, "George LeMieux voted against the majority of Republicans and joined with Democrats to create a 'Task Force For Responsible Fiscal Action' that looks strikingly similar to the 'Super Committee' now being set up in Washington to justify massive tax hikes." LeMieux did vote against the majority of Republicans, joining with Democrats in an attempt to create a Task Force For Responsible Fiscal Action — though the proposal had more bipartisan support than Hasner's full news release suggests. Meanwhile, while the task force would have been substantially similar to the supercommittee just established by Congress, it's different enough that LeMieux could explain his change of support without a change of heart. Finally, it's a serious stretch to say the supercommittee was designed "to justify massive tax hikes." While tax increases are one plausible outcome, they aren't required, and depending on the baseline committee members choose, may not even be likely. On balance, the claim is Half True.

pomt-00383	Says "Mimi Walters raised taxes on middle-class Californians."	mostly false	/california/statements/2018/sep/07/katie-porter/fact-checking-democrat-katie-porters-tax-attack-ad/	If Democrats are to retake the U.S. House, California is likely to play a big part. And near the top of any list of toss-up races is California’s 45th Congressional District, an Orange County seat held by incumbent Republican Rep. Mimi Walters. Hillary Clinton carried the district in 2016 by five percentage points, and Democrats have nominated UC Irvine law professor Katie Porter to challenge Walters this November. One big issue in the race: President Donald Trump's 2017 tax overhaul. While the tax bill, which Walters supported, cut taxes for many, Porter claimed in a recent television ad that it will actually raise taxes on "middle-class Californians." "Mimi Walters votes with Donald Trump 99 percent of the time and Mimi Walters raised taxes on middle-class Californians," Porter’s ad claims. Here, we’re focusing on Porter’s claim that Walters "raised taxes on middle-class Californians." Porter campaign manager Erica Kwiatkowski said the claim stems from Walters’ vote for the Trump tax bill. What the federal tax bill means for California The tax bill, signed into law by Trump in December 2017, cuts corporate taxes across as well as income taxes for many Americans. But residents in higher-tax states like California will be hurt by changes to the state and local tax deduction. Previously, California residents could deduct the amount they pay in state and local taxes from their federal tax bill. As part of the 2017 tax bill, deductions will be capped at $10,000. The provision is set to end after 2025. About 6.1 million Californians filed for the deduction in 2015, reducing their federal tax income by an average of $18,438, according to the Urban Institute-Brookings Institution Tax Policy Center, an independent group that models the effects of tax legislation. A report prepared by the Government Finance Officers Association, a group made up of government finance officers, shows similar numbers. The average deduction in California, New York and New Jersey are all over $17,000. If the state and local tax deduction were eliminated, "an average taxpayer in New York who currently itemizes SALT (state and local tax) would face a tax increase of almost $5,500." That figure wouldn’t be far off for a decent chunk of Californians. How it affects middle-class Californians First, the 1 million California taxpayers who may have to shell out more tax money next year, as seen in Porter’s ad, are not all middle class. The Sacramento Bee reported that while Californians will lose a collective $12 billion because the new law caps the state and local tax deduction, the lion’s share of that money will be paid by wealthy residents earning more than $1 million a year, with 43,000 of them paying a combined $9 billion. Still, some middle-class California families are predicted to pay more, too, according to an analysis by the state’s Franchise Tax Board. The board has been releasing reports on the tax bill in waves since it was signed into law in December. Notably, the tax board found that while most Californians should see a tax cut, about 751,000 households with incomes under $250,000 will likely owe more tax. Taken together, these taxpayers are estimated to owe an extra $1.1 billion. Regardless, it’s still hard to tell how it will affect each family as every tax return is different. And in a state with more than 39 million people, many middle-class Californians will see a tax cut — not an increase. "In general, tax situations are unique for everyone, and it's difficult to assess a broad-ranging effect on future years, without having specific information about a person's return," a spokesperson for the tax board told PolitiFact. The Los Angeles Times also reported that Walters spent weeks pushing House leaders to alter the bill to lower the burden on her constituents before deciding to support it. She told the organization that she believes the "changes to deductions" and "tweaks to the income ranges" would mean a tax cut for her constituents. "I campaigned on tax reform. I’ve always been a big proponent that we need to have tax reform in this country, and I think we have a very good package that we are presenting to the American people," she told the Times. It is worth noting that Walters’ Republican counterparts in nearby districts, Reps. Dana Rohrabacher and Darrell Issa, both voted against the measure. Our ruling Porter’s ad says, "Mimi Walters raised taxes on middle-class Californians." That's misleading. While a provision in the tax bill will result in tax increases for some middle-class Californians, it won't for many more. The ad ignores all that context, along with the fact that lion's share of the tax increases Porter is talking about will be paid for by wealthy Californians. Porter's statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression. We rate it Mostly False.

pomt-08198	On high-speed rail.	full flop	/wisconsin/statements/2010/nov/23/tom-petri/tom-petri-heads-opposite-direction-high-speed-rail/	Over 31 years in Congress, U.S. Rep. Tom Petri, a Republican from Fond du Lac, has kept a pretty low profile on controversial issues. So it was a bit of a surprise to see his name on the bottom of a Nov. 17, 2010 statement that called the Madison-Milwaukee high speed rail link a "boondoggle" and declared: "This high speed rail project is a bad investment for taxpayers and our state simply cannot afford it." Especially since Petri’s name was on an earlier letter, dated Aug. 10, 2009, about the high-speed rail effort, which said in part: "This investment will strengthen the surrounding Midwest economies through new rail and construction jobs, while also increasing development and connectivity from rural to urban areas." What happened in those intervening 15 months? Well, after Republican Gov. Tommy G. Thompson and Democratic Gov. Jim Doyle spent years working with other Midwestern states on plans for high-speed rail, the Milwaukee-Madison link was one of 13 projects selected to receive federal funding -- $810 million -- in January 2010. Then Republican Scott Walker made stopping the train a central part of this gubernatorial campaign, as did Republican candidates in Ohio and Florida. Now, Walker says Congress should allow the state to use the $810 million on roads -- though many, including Petri, say that’s unlikely. Other states -- New York, North Carolina, California and, of course, Illinois -- are clamoring for the money Wisconsin is about to take a pass on. And, the state’s Republican members of Congress are, well, circling the wagons around Walker. Thus, the November statement from Petri and U.S. Reps. Jim Sensenbrenner of Menomonee Falls and Paul Ryan of Janesville. It read: "We support Governor-elect Walker's effort to put the brakes on the High Speed Rail budget boondoggle, which is why we introduced legislation, today, that would give states the ability to return federal funds obligated to high-speed rail projects, and instead use this money to reduce our nation’s $1.6 trillion deficit and $13.8 trillion debt." So, it’s time again to roll out the Flip-O-Meter. Remember, we’re not passing judgment on whether the shift was good policy or even good politics. The Flip-O-Meter measures only how much an elected official’s position has changed. Petri’s position was pretty clear in that first letter, in which he joined with U.S. Rep. Jim Oberstar (D-Minn.) and announced the creation of a congressional caucus to support high speed rail, including the network that would include the Milwaukee-Madison link. That was the letter about a strengthened economy and all that rural-urban connectivity. In many ways, the letter was in line with the views of Thompson, who was a strong backer of the high-speed network as governor and chairman of the Amtrak board. In September, Thompson did his own shift and said the state instead should ask that the money go to highways. "I was supportive of high speed trains because I believe high-speed trains has a place," Thompson said at the time. "But at this day and time and the circumstances we have right now, we can't afford it." Petri, a long-time member of the House Transportation Committee, said he was merely heeding the wishes of state leaders, first Thompson and then Doyle. "My position was to make the strongest case I could for Wisconsin to have high speed rail," Petri told PolitiFact Wisconsin. "That was successful." So, what happened since? Petri said Walker’s election indicates that sentiment has turned away from the train. And if the train is stopped here, he wants the money to go to reduce the federal deficit -- not another state’s rail project. But how do you square a statement about the project's benefits with one declaring it a "boondoggle"? Asked about the stark difference in the two letters bearing his boss’ signature, spokesman Niel Wright said Petri didn’t write the recent letter -- it came from Sensenbrenner’s office. "Sensenbrenner is hotter on this and more determined on this than Mr. Petri," Wright said. Indeed, in his interview with us, Petri sounded remarkably open to the need for a rail connection from Madison to Milwaukee and Chicago. "It probably should be considered at some point," especially as Madison continues to grow, he said. Petri also noted that the train was a "pet project" of President Barack Obama -- and that it was highly unlikely that the president would sign legislation directing the money for road work or deficit reduction. He said Wisconsin’s money could well wind up going to another state. "If that’s the choice," Petri said, "I’d say just go ahead with it." If so, the Flip-O-Meter will be back for the backflip. For now, we’ll say Petri has gone from a full-blown advocate for the high speed rail project to signing onto a statement that condemned the project. And that’s a Full Flop.

pomt-02298	The National Science Foundation awarded $700,000 to fund a climate change musical.	true	/texas/statements/2014/apr/02/lamar-smith/climate-change-musical-funded-700000-national-scie/	Republican U.S. Rep. Lamar Smith, whose district stretches from San Antonio north into Austin, recently pressed an official about the government bankrolling a musical. Smith, chairman of the House Science, Space & Technology Committee, listed six National Science Foundation grants as questionable--including, Smith said at the panel’s March 26, 2014, hearing, a "climate change musical that was prepared for Broadway but I’m not sure ever was actually produced, $700,000." Smith then asked John Holdren, the White House science czar, if the foundation should justify such grants to the public, whose tax dollars fund them, the Texan reminded. Holdren replied that the foundation, which is entrusted with promoting scientific progress, already justifies its grants in online posts. "We’re going to have to agree to disagree," Smith said. We’ve noted the scientific consensus globally that the Earth is warming. We focused for this article on whether the foundation ponied up for a play about that. Grant confirmed To our inquiry, a foundation spokeswoman, Dana Topousis, said by email the grant was awarded in 2010, adding: "The Civilians, Inc., a Brooklyn, N.Y., theatre company, developed an innovative, out-of-the-box approach to exposing U.S. citizens to science. The project represents the unique cultural leverage of theater in its attempt to inspire the public’s imagination and curiosity about basic science and its relation to their everyday lives." Topousis continued: "This venture, like other more traditional NSF-funded informal science education projects (e.g., interactive science exhibits, IMAX films, science-based television programming), aims to educate through a focus on understanding the scientific method, its applications, and its unique ability to extract knowledge about our complex natural world. It presents the pursuit of fundamental knowledge through basic research in a neutral manner that does not advocate any position regarding climate change or conservation research," she said. A foundation summary of the grant award, brought to our attention by Topousis and Zach Kurz, staff spokesman for the Republican side of Smith’s committee, states that a grant totaling $697,177 was awarded in 2010 covering August 2010 through July 2014. Play description The summary describes "The Great Immensity" as a "touring play with songs and video that explores our relationship to the environment, with a focus on critical issues of climate change and biodiversity conservation." "The play has been created with a network of partners including the Princeton Environmental Institute and Princeton Atelier Program/Lewis Arts Center, which will maintain an ongoing relationship with the project," the summary says, continuing: "The play uses real places and stories drawn from interviews conducted by the artists to create an experience that is part investigative journalism and part inventive theater. Attendance at the performances is projected to be about 75,000." The summary also says: "A major goal of the project is to help the public better appreciate how science studies the Earth's biosphere and to promote an inquisitive curiosity about our place in the natural world. The initiative also intends to create and evaluate a new model for how theater can increase public awareness, knowledge, and engagement with important science-related societal issues." Also, the summary says, the project will lead to the "development and testing of online content, podcasts, and videos as well as special community education and outreach efforts in each community where the play is staged. Performances will be accompanied by post-performance panel discussions with the artists, local scientists and policy makers. After the completion of the initial tour, the play will be published, licensed, and made available to other theaters to produce independently." Tickets on sale By phone, Sarah Benvenuti, an administrator for the Civilian Theater Co., said the play is slated to run April 11-May 1, 2014, at the Public Theater’s Martinson Hall in New York, which is not on Broadway. Tickets will be $20 each, she said. Benvenuti said the play is about climate change and includes musical numbers, which one can view in online videos. "Margin of Error," for instance, shows cast members singing about poll results. (Really.) We wondered if the presentation is explicit, say, about human contributions to warming. Benevenuti didn’t say, though she stressed that the play draws on direct conversations with expert scientists. "Climate change is a real thing," she said. "We have to do something about it." The script is not published, she said, but she pointed out the Public Theater’s online description of the play as a "continent-hopping thriller following a woman, Phyllis, as she pursues her husband Karl who disappeared from a tropical island while on an assignment for a nature show. Through her search," the summary says, "Phyllis uncovers a mysterious plot surrounding the upcoming international climate summit in Paris. As the days count down to the summit, Phyllis must decipher the plan and possibly stop it in time. With arresting projected film and video and a wide-ranging score of songs," the play "is a highly theatrical look into one of the most vital questions of our time: how can we change ourselves and our society in time to solve the enormous environmental challenges that confront us?" Finally, we circled back to the foundation to ask if the musical was an unusual grant beneficiary. Topousis replied by email that while the NSF "research portfolio this falls under--Advancing Informal STEM Learning (AISL)--contains projects at the intersection of science and the arts, NSF’s funding this kind of project--a theatrical production--is rare." Our ruling Smith said the science foundation awarded $700,000 for a climate change musical.

pomt-09157	Halliburton defrauded American taxpayers of "hundreds of millions of dollars in Iraq."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/jun/09/arianna-huffington/halliburton-kbr-and-iraq-war-contracting-history-s/	We have a hard time resisting when people on national television ask us to fact-check them. The latest instance began with Arianna Huffington, founder of the liberal Huffington Post, talking on ABC's This Week about the causes of the Gulf of Mexico oil spill. "The truth is that right now we have precisely the regulatory system that the Bush-Cheney Administration wanted -- full of loopholes, full of cronies and lobbyists filling the very agencies they're supposed to be overseeing," she said, adding a bit later, "Right here, we have the poster child of Bush-Cheney crony capitalism. Halliburton (was) involved in this, and we haven't said (anything) about that. They after all were responsible for cementing the well. Here's Halliburton, after it defrauded the American taxpayer (of) hundreds of millions of dollars is involved again..." That's when conservative pundit Liz Cheney interrupted. "Arianna, I don't know what planet you live on ..." she said, starting interruptions and crosstalk that finally ended with this: Cheney: "Her assertion that Halliburton defrauded the U.S. government --" Huffington: "It did. It did." Cheney: "-- that it was Bush-Cheney cronyism -- these are the left's talking points --" Huffington: "It did -- hundreds of millions of dollars in Iraq." Cheney: "Arianna, it is absolutely not true. It is absolutely not true." Huffington: "Okay, I'm so glad PolitiFact is going to be checking this. I'm so glad." Cheney: "Good, good." There is no dispute that Halliburton was a contractor on the Deepwater Horizon rig, which is what Huffington was alluding to when she said Halliburton was "involved" in the oil spill. Host Jake Tapper affirmed that, then Cheney indicated she was objecting specifically to the claim of fraud. So we decided to fact-check Huffington's statement that Halliburton defrauded the U.S. government of "hundreds of millions of dollars in Iraq." We first want to note something not explicitly stated on the show: Former Vice President Dick Cheney was CEO of Halliburton before becoming vice president, and Liz Cheney is his daughter. And we'll also stipulate that there is a mountain of evidence that many American companies profited off of the government's inefficient contracting system during the rebuilding of Iraq. Dick Cheney was secretary of defense from 1989 to 1993, during the administration of President George H.W. Bush. A few years after leaving office, he became chairman and chief executive officer of Halliburton, a Houston-based oil services company. He led Halliburton until 2000, when he left to run for vice president on a ticket with George W. Bush. The Iraq war began a few years later. Most of the allegations of waste involving Halliburton focus on a subsidary company that Halliburton acquired in 1962, then known as Brown & Root. A series of mergers under Halliburton's ownership led to its current name, Kellogg, Brown & Root, or KBR. Halliburton's KBR held one of the largest contracts given during the Iraq war effort, the Logistics Civil Augmentation Program, or LOGCAP, which was part of the trend of government outsourcing traditionally military duties to the private sector. (We're focusing on the LOGCAP contract in this report because it's the contract that has the potential for "hundreds of millions of dollars" in fraud. There have been other isolated allegations of fraud that involved significantly smaller amounts.) The history of KBR's LOGCAP contracts are documented in Hard Lessons: The Iraq Reconstruction Experience, a 2009 report prepared by the Office of the Special Inspector General for Iraq Reconstruction: "Just as USAID had outsourced much of its work in the years after the Cold War, the military also had turned to the private sector to perform work once done by its own personnel. Under the LOGCAP contract, which KBR held for all but a few years since the program's inception in 1985, contractors provide services ranging from building bases to cooking food and doing laundry. LOGCAP grew out of the post-Vietnam downsizing of the armed services, reflecting the government-wide growth of outsourcing, which would dramatically affect the war and reconstruction efforts in Iraq. In World War II, one contractor was deployed for every seven soldiers. During the 2003 invasion, that number had increased to one for every 2.4. By 2006, contractors outnumbered soldiers in Iraq." The report noted that some government officials raised the concern of a potential conflict of interest because of Cheney's former position with Halliburton, but that "White House officials said the mission took priority over whatever political fallout might occur" from awarding contracts to KBR. Since winning the latest version of the LOGCAP contract in 2001, the government has ordered work from KBR worth more than $31 billion. Government officials have raised many questions about KBR's fulfillment of its contracts, everything from billing for meals it didn't serve to charging inflated prices for gas to excessive administrative costs. Government auditors have noted that KBR refused to turn over electronic data in its native format and stamped documents as proprietary and secret when the documents would normally be considered public records. Over the course of several years, the Defense Contract Audit Agency found that $553 million in payments should be disallowed to KBR, according to 2009 testimony by agency director April Stephenson before the bipartisan Commission on Wartime Contracting in Iraq and Afghanistan. Commissioner Charles Tiefer, a professor at the University of Baltimore Law School, said that amount represents a small portion of everything that auditors examined as potentially questionable. "The DCAA is known for cautious conclusions about contracting," Tiefer said. "The large majority of those auditor findings get actually withheld from the contractor." KBR itself acknowleges it may not get paid for all of its contract services. In its most recent annual report filed with the Securities Exchange Commission, it acknowledged that the Defense Contract Audit Agency was recommending withholding $289 million in contract costs not yet paid and asking for the return of $121 million already paid. "We continue to work with our administrative contracting officers, the DCAA and our subcontractors to resolve these issues. However, for certain of these matters, we have filed claims with the Armed Services Board of Contract Appeals or the United States Court of Claims," the report states. But there is one notable allegation where KBR is being accused of fraud, that KBR "knowingly included impermissible costs" in its bills. In April 2010, the U.S. Department of Justice filed a civil fraud case against KBR over the issue of using private security forces in Iraq to protect its workers and subcontractors. Private security wasn't allowed under the LOGCAP contract because the U.S. military was supposed to provide protection. The lawsuit alleges that internal documents showed KBR executives knew private security wasn't allowed but charged for it anyway. While the lawsuit doesn't put a dollar amount on those billings, the director of the Defense Contract Audit Agency said the total could come to $99 million or higher. KBR has denied wrongdoing and said in a response to the lawsuit that the government has known for years that KBR was hiring private security, and KBR only did so because its employees were being left unprotected by the military. "KBR believes the costs incurred and actions taken by the company and its subcontractors to provide support and to protect its employees and subcontractors were reasonable, necessary and appropriate under the contractual arrangement between KBR and the Army. ... The Army breached the contract by repeatedly failing to provide the necessary force protection," the statement said. "Since 2001, KBR and its employees and subcontractors have worked diligently, and at often times at great sacrifice, to support American troops serving in Iraq," it also said. We should note here that KBR workers have died in Iraq. Company officials said 74 people working on the LOGCAP III contract have died in Iraq between 2003 and 2010. Halliburton sold KBR in 2007. Halliburton officials said KBR's war contracts weren't adding much to the oil company's profits. The same year, Halliburton opened a "second headquarters" (their words) in Dubai, in the United Arab Emirates, to emphasize its identity as a worldwide oil services company. But Halliburton did own KBR during the height of KBR's activities in Iraq. The Department of Justice fraud lawsuit specifically stipulates that KBR was overcharging between 2003 and 2006, years that Halliburton owned the company. We asked Halliburton for comment on this report, and they sent us this statement: "Halliburton cannot comment on activity that relates to KBR's work in Iraq and Afghanistan as it would be inappropriate for Halliburton to comment on the merits of a matter affecting only the interest of KBR." The U.S. government continues to use KBR for contract work in Iraq. In fact, the U.S. Army recently granted additional work worth $568 million to KBR in May. Military officials said it would be too disruptive to change contractors at this point in the process. Indeed, one defense of KBR's work is that they take extra steps -- which some might call excessive -- to keep troops happy with extra amenities at the request of military commanders. Recently, government officials have warned that KBR is dragging its feet on withdrawing its personnel from Iraq; the company's withdrawal rate significantly lags that of the military itself. If KBR doesn't reduce its employees in Iraq quicker, the U.S. government could be overbilled by as much as $193 million in 2010, officials said during hearings held by the Commission on Wartime Spending in Iraq and Afghanistan. In evaluating Huffington's statement, we're most bothered by her use of the word "defrauded." Some of the overbilling in Iraq appears to have been done from haste or inefficiency, or even in a desire to please military officials in the field without regard for cost. Whether the waste in contracting constitutes fraud is still being examined. "It's a lot money being spent in a region of the world where we don't have a lot of infrastructure for accounting for how the money is being spent. It will take years before we fully determine how we spent the money," said Todd Harrison, a senior fellow for defense budget studies at the nonpartisan Center for Strategic and Budgetary Assessments. In ruling on Huffington's statement, we find much in the public record to support her statement, most notably the Justice Department lawsuit. Certainly there have been hundreds of millions of dollars that Halliburton's KBR attempted to charge the government that have been denied. Government audits of KBR's work in Iraq will likely continue for some time, and we do not expect a final accounting on these fronts anytime soon. Huffington glossed over some of these points in her back and forth with Liz Cheney. There's also much evidence that makes us believe that hundreds of millions of dollars were lost to waste and inefficiency, not deceitful fraud. So we rate Huffington's statement Half True.

pomt-00388	"Fully half the people — our research is showing half the people — in (California) want to leave."	half-true	/california/statements/2018/sep/06/john-cox/john-coxs-exaggerated-claim-half-people-want-leave/	High taxes. Traffic-clogged freeways. Soaring housing costs. These are all reasons some Californians say they want to leave for less-expensive and lower-tax states from Arizona to Texas. But does half the state’s population really want to move out? That’s what Republican candidate for governor John Cox claimed in an interview on the Fox Business Network, which aired July 30, 2018. The segment centered on the state’s high cost-of-living and Cox’s promise to help the "forgotten Californians" if elected. The San Diego businessman is running against Democratic Lt. Gov. Gavin Newsom. Here’s the exchange between Fox host Charles Payne and Cox: Payne: "It’s so bifurcated. Either you’re seriously wealthy, very, very wealthy where plastic surgeons have hundred million dollar homes. Or you’re extraordinarily poor and the people in the middle are trying to flee if they’re not stuck." Cox: "And that’s the point, because fully half the people — our research is showing — half the people in this state, Charles, want to leave." Cox makes his claim in the video above. We decided to fact-check Cox’s claim about ‘half the people in this state’ wanting to leave. Not a new trend California’s once-rapid population growth has slowed in recent decades. More people have been leaving for other states than have been moving in for many years, according to a February 2018 study by the California Legislative Analyst’s Office. About five million people moved to California from other states, while about six million left the state from 2007 to 2016, according to the LAO report, which cited data from the American Community Survey. That doesn’t mean, however, that California’s overall population is in decline. Just the opposite: It’s grown by an average 333,000 people per year since 2010 largely due to natural births and international migration. California was home to 39.8 million people as of January 2018, according to the California Department of Finance. That included an increase of 309,000 residents in 2017 alone and nearly 2.3 million over seven years. Half the state wants to leave? To examine Cox’s claim, we reviewed two independent polls that raised a similar question. They didn’t find 50 percent of people wanting to flee. But they did find sizeable, if somewhat smaller, portions of the state at least considering it. In its September 2017 survey, the Public Policy Institute of California asked whether California’s high housing costs were making them consider moving. It found: "About four in ten Californians (44 percent adults, 41 percent likely voters) say the cost of their housing is making them seriously consider moving away from the part of California they live in now." Here’s the PPIC survey’s breakdown of where that 44 percent would consider moving to: • 33 percent outside the state; • 10 percent elsewhere in California; • 1 percent listed as "other." UC Berkeley survey A September 2017 survey by the UC Berkeley Institute of Governmental Studies found 56 percent of Californians had considered moving because of rising housing costs, though not necessarily out of the state. Only 25 of those surveyed said that, if they moved, it would most likely be to another state. Another 2 percent said they’d move to another country. Meanwhile, 23 percent of respondents said they would most likely move to another part of California or another place in their general area, if they relocated. Cox’s response Cox’s spokesman Matt Shupe told us the candidate was referencing the campaign’s internal polling. He provided information about June and August surveys that asked people their opinion on repealing the state gas tax increase; whether California government is on the right track; and whether the standard of living for most middle-class and working families was improving, getting worse or remaining flat. It then asked: "Over the next few years, how likely is it that you would move out of state?" The June poll showed 21 percent answered "very likely" and 29 percent "somewhat likely" for a total of 50 percent. The August survey totaled 52 percent for those answers. The internal poll was conducted online and has a smaller sample size than the independent surveys. It conducted 800 interviews, while the PPIC survey spoke with 1,700 people and UC Berkeley interviewed 1,200. Also, Cox’s internal poll and the UC Berkeley survey spoke only with registered voters. PPIC’s survey includes responses from registered and non-registered Californians. "For us, we need to represent the entire population," said Mark Baldassare, PPIC’s president and survey director. Cox’s spokesman also cited a poll by the Bay Area Council showing 46 percent of voters either somewhat or strongly feel they are "likely to move out of the Bay Area in the next few years." That poll, however, did not examine attitudes statewide. Our ruling Republican candidate for governor John Cox claimed in a recent Fox Business Network interview that "Fully half the people — our research is showing — half the people in this state … want to leave." Independent polls place that share at one-quarter to one-third of Californians. That’s still a large amount but not half. Internal polls commissioned by the Cox campaign, and using a smaller sample size, show 50 percent of those asked were either "very likely" or "somewhat likely" to move out of the state over the next few years. Cox’s statement, while it includes the caveat that "our research is showing," leaves the impression for the average viewer that it’s a settled fact that half of California wants to move out. But that’s only the case if one relies on internal figures from the campaign, and ignores results from two outside surveys with much larger samples. His claim is partially accurate, but it leaves out important details and takes things out of context. We rate it Half True.

pomt-01308	"We have spent $350 million to deal with sea-level rise" in the Miami area and "hundreds of millions of dollars to deal with coral reefs."	mostly false	/florida/statements/2014/oct/29/rick-scott/florida-spending-350-million-deal-sea-level-rise/	Gov. Rick Scott has drawn criticism from environmentalists for denying in 2011 that man contributes to climate change and now dodging questions with the reply of "I’m not a scientist." The topic arose during the Oct. 21 CNN debate when moderator Jake Tapper asked Gov. Rick Scott why he was "reluctant to believe the overwhelming majority of scientists who say that man contributes to climate change." Instead of answering the question directly, Scott claimed that he had already taken action to protect the environment, including addressing sea-level rise. "We have spent $350 million to deal with sea-level rise down in the Keys, or down in the Miami area. We spent hundreds of millions of dollars to deal with coral reefs," he said. Scott made a similar claim in the debate at Broward College on Oct. 15. Scott’s claim, particularly about investing in projects to combat sea-level rise, stood out for us. Under Scott, has the state spent $350 million to deal with sea-level rise in the Miami area and hundreds of millions to protect coral reefs? Did Scott invest hundreds of millions to help coral reefs? We asked a Scott campaign spokeswoman to provide details about the spending for both projects. As for the coral reefs, Jackie Schutz told PolitiFact that the state had "$100 million spent on protecting the Keys." The money stemmed from a mandate by the state for the Keys to upgrade from cesspits and septic tanks to a modern sewer system. Improving water quality can help coral reefs. In 1999 when Jeb Bush was governor, the state required that the Keys comply with wastewater standards that would necessitate modern sewer by 2010. That deadline would later be extended to 2015. To meet that goal, when Charlie Crist, was governor the Legislature approved a bill in 2008 that allowed bonding of $50 million a year for four years for the wastewater program. The bill stated that "beginning July 1, 2010, the Legislature shall analyze the ratio of the state's debt to projected revenues prior to the authorization to issue any bonds under this section." No money was actually doled out during the Crist administration, which coincided with the recession. Scott took over as governor in 2011. The first year that the state doled out money was in 2012. But the next year Scott, along with legislative leaders, decided not to issue bonds due to concerns about the state’s debt capacity, according to an article in the Florida Keys Keynoter. In 2014, the state doled out the second $50 million. In August 2014, Scott’s campaign released a "Let’s Keep Florida Beautiful Plan," which included a promise to invest another $100 million in the Keys wastewater project. So how does the sewer system relate to coral reefs? Centralized wastewater treatment prevents nutrients and other pollutants from entering nearshore waters, said Chris Bergh of The Nature Conservancy in the Keys. Wastewater treatment kills bacteria from human waste that can cause coral disease. "It was a great boon to the Keys environment and residents, but it will not affect sea-level rise in any but the most tangential ways," Bergh said. Sea-level rise money A spokesman for Scott’s office, John Tupps, sent us a list of what he said amounted to over $350 million "to address flood mitigation and sea-level rise." The projects were administered by various state agencies and included the following, in addition to the $100 million for sewer in the Keys: • $21 million for FEMA flood map modernization; • $122 beach protection projects; • $5 million for the coastal zone management program; • $80 million for flood mitigation in Florida in coastal communities; • $25 million for the Keys wastewater revolving loan program projects. The first thing we will point out is to get to $350 million Scott counted $100 million to install a sewer system in the Keys even though the point of that project wasn’t to deal with sea-level rise. We asked environmental experts if these additional projects should be considered as steps toward combating sea-level rise. They told us that while these projects have their merits, they aren’t long-term solutions to sea-level rise. For example, better flood maps help identify properties that are vulnerable under today’s conditions to flooding, but they don’t deal with future sea-level rise, Bergh said. These are typical beach maintenance and flooding-related projects. Scott hasn’t taken steps that scientists say would address future sea-level rise such as reducing coal-fired power plants. Florida State University oceanography professor Jeff Chanton said that if the beach protection projects refer to pumping sand onto the beach, that is an "ineffective short-term temporary fix." Chanton was one of the scientists who met with Scott this summer and urged him to take action on climate change. The scientists showed Scott how two feet of sea-level rise -- projected by 2048 -- will swallow much of Miami-Dade and Monroe counties. They called on Scott to reduce or eliminate coal-fired power plants; wean the state off carbon-emitting natural gas and oil-fired power; and develop more alternative energy options. The scientists noted that sea-level rise has already caused flooding in Miami Beach at high tide. We also sought out several government officials in Broward and Miami-Dade counties as well as the cities of Miami and Miami Beach to see if they had received state money to combat sea-level rise. No one could pinpoint a specific project. "I have no idea what he's talking about. It's the first I've heard of it," said Monroe County Commissioner Heather Carruthers, who serves on the Southeast Florida Regional Climate Change Compact, in an interview with the Florida Keys Keynoter. Our ruling Scott said during the CNN debate, "We have spent $350 million to deal with sea-level rise" in the Miami area and "hundreds of millions dollars to deal with coral reefs." The state has spent $100 million to help the Keys upgrade to a sewer system, which should improve water quality -- a benefit for coral reefs. Scott omits that it was under Crist that the Legislature passed a law paving the way for the money, and he's wrong to claim it's "hundreds of millions." Scott’s office also pointed to a list of projects including flood mitigation, flood maps and beach protection -- and throws in the $100 million for the sewer project -- to make his claim about $350 million to deal with sea-level rise. While these include worthy projects, experts say they aren't directly related to addressing future sea-level rise. They’re typical projects for Florida, not new measures to address climate change.

pomt-15190	A "majority in every state favors path to citizenship for undocumented immigrants."	mostly true	/wisconsin/statements/2015/aug/19/state-democratic-party-wisconsin/wisconsin-democrats-say-path-citizenship-supported/	As two flocks of Republican presidential hopefuls debated Aug. 6, 2015, the Democratic Party of Wisconsin made a claim and posed a question about one of the debate topics. "Majority in every state favors path to citizenship for undocumented immigrants," the party tweeted. "Even @scottwalker used to. Who are these guys pandering to?" PolitiFact Wisconsin has traced Walker’s reversal of his longstanding support for legal status for undocumented immigrants. We rated it a Full Flop in March 2015. Walker attributed the change in position to discussions with border-state governors; critics said he sought to better position himself to win support from conservative voters critical to the GOP nominating process. But what about the first part? Is public opinion in all 50 states in favor of a path to citizenship for illegal immigrants? Where the numbers come from Most of the independent polling on immigration is done on a national basis, with results drawn from samples of about 1,000 people; typically those polls do not break out state by state results. But a nearly yearlong telephone survey of 40,751 Americans, conducted from April 2014 to January 2015, the nonpartisan Public Religion Research Institute (PRRI) featured state results on immigration and other topics. It was part of what the organization calls its American Values Atlas, an online map based on a large sample size the group says "allows analysis of specific census regions, all 50 states, and even 30 major metropolitan areas." The American Values Atlas was funded by The Ford Foundation and The Carnegie Corporation of New York. Democratic Party spokeswoman Melissa Baldauff cited the Values Atlas as proof of the claim in the tweet. The effort found that majorities in every state, ranging from 52 percent in Wyoming to 66 percent in Delaware, favored allowing immigrants living illegally in the United States a way to become citizens, provided they meet "certain requirements." Those requirements were not spelled out. In Wisconsin, 61 percent in the poll favored the citizenship viewpoint. In terms of the overall national picture, the path to citizenship viewpoint was taken by 60 percent in the survey. Republicans backed it by a slim majority (52 percent), Democrats by 68 percent. The other two choices respondents were given included allowing illegal immigrants to become permanent legal residents (but not citizens), or identifying and deporting them. Permanent legal status drew a range from 9 percent (Wyoming) to 23 percent (Hawaii). Deportation drew between 11 percent (Vermont) and 38 percent (Wyoming). More about the poll We asked nationally respected Marquette University pollster Charles Franklin to assess the American Values Atlas. He said the institute that conducted the poll has a good reputation in the polling community, uses sound methods and is transparent in its reporting. The poll uses the same methodology for all states and does not use Internet or robo-polling. Immigration opinion has been reasonably stable recently, diminishing concerns about polling over a whole year, he said. Franklin cautioned, though, that some small states have small sample sizes, reducing the precision of those results. He defined small as under 300 responses; 14 states fit that description. Wyoming, for instance, had 95 residents interviewed. In those small-sample states, the margin of error would grow to at least 6-10 percentage points in either direction, he said. (That compares to 0.6 percent in the nationwide sample). It’s worth noting, though, that in all but Wyoming, the small-sample states had majorities of at least 56 percent for a path to citizenship. Some of those states were as high as 65 percent. In Wisconsin, the Marquette Law School Poll directed by Franklin has found majorities of 52 percent to 58 percent in Wisconsin for a path to citizenship in polls conducted from 2012-14, Franklin said. State polls Question wording and timing also influence poll results, and that can lead to conflicting results at times, especially on a complicated issue. With that in mind, we searched for other independent state-level polling on immigration reform choices. In Wyoming, a November 2014 poll by the University of Wyoming found only 25 percent backed a path to citizenship. Another 39 percent supported allowing illegal immigrants to stay and work for a time, while about 37 percent backed deportation. While the wording is different than the survey cited by the Democrats in their claim, the results undermine the idea that a majority in every state favor a path to citizenship. Meanwhile, an advocacy group that seeks to discourage illegal immigration and reject "amnesty" for illegal workers has raised questions about polls on a path to citizenship. The group, Federation for American Immigration Reform, thinks deportation is politically infeasible and should not be presented as the only alternative to citizenship or legal status. Instead of a path to citizenship, the group prefers to ask people how they feel about "encouraging illegal immigrants to return home" by removing jobs and government benefits. In a 2013 survey it commissioned, the group found a majority backed either deportation or such "encouraged" departures, according to its website. Robert Jones, CEO of PRRI, the group that did the American Values Atlas, said asking about deportation was fair based on rhetoric used by key Republican leaders. Our rating A "majority in every state favors path to citizenship for undocumented immigrants," the Wisconsin Democratic Party tweeted. There’s recent backing from a respected and independent opinion research outfit for the state-by-state claim. We found one instance of a contradictory result in a somewhat similarly worded question, and small sample sizes in some states are pretty small. So the finding is not airtight. We rate the claim Mostly True.	None	Democratic Party of Wisconsin	None	None	None	2015-08-19T06:00:00	2015-08-06	['None']
pomt-01240	"No one was taken into custody" for feeding the homeless.	mostly true	/florida/statements/2014/nov/17/jack-seiler/jack-seiler-says-arnold-abbott-90-year-old-wasnt-t/	The city of Fort Lauderdale’s latest attempt to regulate outdoor homeless feedings made international news when police nabbed "Chef Arnold" -- a 90-year-old caught in the act of such a public feeding. "One of the police officers said, 'Drop that plate right now,' as if I were carrying a weapon," Arnold Abbott said, recalling his early November arrest for the Associated Press. Multiple news reports -- and Comedy Central’s The Colbert Report -- recounted the tale of Abbott’s arrest, which reignited a long-running debate about how the city should handle the homeless population downtown and at the beach. On Nov. 5, Fort Lauderdale Mayor Jack Seiler issued a statement in which he said he wanted to "set the record straight" about the city’s services for homeless. He said that the media had misrepresented the facts. "Contrary to reports," Seiler wrote, "the City of Fort Lauderdale is not banning groups from feeding the homeless." Seiler said outdoor feeding is legal, but added that a new city law regulates the activity. Then Seiler addressed the situation regarding Abbott: "At two recent outdoor food distributions, citations were rightly issued for non-compliance with the process enacted to ensure public health and safety. Contrary to what was reported in the media, no one was taken into custody. ..." As the public-relations crisis escalated, Seiler gave multiple interviews to the media. On CNN Nov. 11, Seiler said Abbott "was not arrested and taken into custody." At PolitiFact Florida we agree with Seiler’s goal of setting the record straight. Was Abbott taken into custody? Fort Lauderdale’s laws about the homeless Abbott’s battle with the city has brought notoriety to Seiler, a former state representative who has been mentioned as a future statewide candidate for the Democrats. Seiler faces re-election to a third term in March. So far, no one has filed to run against him. Abbott, who founded an interfaith volunteer organization Love Thy Neighbor to help the homeless, has been battling city leaders for more than a decade. In 1999, the city tried to ban him from holding picnics for the homeless at the beach, offering him an alternative site miles away from downtown. But Abbott prevailed in court when a judge ruled that the city had violated his religious rights and that the city’s new location was too remote. Abbott resumed his feedings and resumed them in visible locations in Stranahan Park in downtown and along the beach. The battle has continued in recent years, with the commission passing a series of laws that attempted to regulate the homeless population, including a ban on soliciting for money at intersections and tougher laws against defecating in public. City officials, including Seiler, have argued that while the homeless should have access to services, including meals, they have heard complaints from some businesses and residents about the homeless population in downtown. Advocates have decried city officials for cracking down on the homeless with a series of laws. At an Oct. 21 meeting, the commission approved the ordinance about outdoor food distribution over the objection of protesters. The ordinance, approved by the Commission 4-1, codified a list of rules for outdoor food distribution, including that sites must be 500 feet away from residential areas, have bathrooms or portable toilets, equipment for hand washing and consent of the owner. The law allows indoor feedings at houses of worship. "You have to balance the interests of everybody in the community," Seiler told PolitiFact Florida. "What we always try to do is make sure everybody gets to enjoy our parks. Every single thing we have done with the ordinance is a balance." But while the law itself doesn’t technically ban outdoor feedings, it raises the bar for groups such as Abbott’s in a way that makes it almost impossible to clear. (Abbott argues that the requirement that he get a port-a-potty should be moot since a public restroom is nearby and he says volunteers wash their hands before feedings and use gloves.) At the time of Seiler’s statement, Abbott had three run-ins with law enforcement related to the outdoor feedings: on Oct. 6, Nov. 2 and Nov. 5, police reports show. (The October arrest predated the new ordinance but the city already had a separate law banning social services in the parks.) On the first two occasions, Abbott was given a warning but then continued with the feedings. The third time, Abbott agreed to end the food distribution that day, police reports say. In none of the three instances was he handcuffed or taken to jail. Instead, he was given notices to appear in court. (In one police report, it states that Abbott shook the police officer’s hand before he left.) At least one other person helping with the feedings was also arrested in a similar manner. A city spokesman told PolitiFact Florida that the case stemming from the Nov. 2 arrest has been filed in court. The city has generally avoided referring to Abbott’s case as an "arrest," but his attorney John David said that just because it’s not a "custodial arrest" doesn’t mean it’s not an arrest. For minor crimes, police use this type of arrest and give defendants notices to appear as long as the person has a connection to the area and is likely to show up in court. Nonetheless, "it's an arrest, no doubt about that," David said. "He is charged with a criminal offense." Fort Lauderdale police Capt. Rick Maglione told PolitiFact Florida that "It is similar to a misdemeanor arrest, but we do not have to take the person physically into custody and they can just show up in court and let a judge decide the case." We interviewed a few criminal defense lawyers in South Florida not involved in the case and they agreed that the police did indeed arrest Abbott. "With all due respect to the mayor, it is an arrest," said Brian Tannebaum, a Miami criminal defense lawyer. "The fact that someone is not taken into custody does not make it something other than an arrest. Misdemeanor cases are handled with promises to appear all the time. The officer has discretion to take someone into custody, but even if they don't it is still considered an arrest." City spokesman Chaz Adams told PolitiFact that although a notice to appear is technically an arrest, "the mayor has been consistent in saying that Mr. Abbott was not "arrested and taken into custody." Abbott faces up to a $500 fine and 60 days in jail for each offense. However, lawyers say it’s unlikely that a judge will throw him behind bars. "I can’t imagine anyone putting Arnold in jail," said Broward public defender Howard Finkelstein. His office is not handling the case, but he has praised Abbott. Abbott’s lawyer filed a motion in Broward court on Nov. 12 that asked a judge to enforce the injunction from the earlier case that allowed Abbott to continue the feedings. The city offered Abbott two alternative sites -- at the city’s aquatic complex near the beach, and at Church by the Sea, located near the beach -- but he rejected both. "I plan to continue my feedings at the same site I have used for the past 23 years," Abbott told PolitiFact Florida in an email. Seiler says it’s not his call what penalty Abbott faces. "We have to enforce the laws, we have to be consistent," Seiler told PolitiFact Florida. "What the courts do with Mr. Abbott -- that’s up to the courts." Seiler has defended his city’s reputation for serving the homeless, which includes working with nonprofits to provide services and allowing the county-run Homeless Assistance center to expand. The city’s police department also has a homeless outreach unit. Fort Lauderdale’s law about feeding the homeless is part of a growing national trend. Since 2007, 71 cities have attempted or enacted some type of rules related to food-sharing activities, according to the National Coalition for the Homeless. "The best solution to the food-sharing issue is to have indoor meal programs available to the homeless three times a day, seven days a week," said Michael Stoops, director of community organizing National Coalition for the Homeless. "If these locations were located conveniently in Downtown Fort Lauderdale, a good number of the homeless would opt to eat inside vs. outside. However, food-sharing with the homeless in public spaces would still be needed." Our ruling Seiler said that "no one was taken into custody" for feeding the homeless. Seiler is correct that Abbott wasn’t taken into custody -- the activist was not handcuffed or taken to jail but was instead given a notice to appear in court. But his carefully worded claim glosses over the fact that Abbott was indeed arrested on more than one occasion for allegedly feeding the homeless in violation of city ordinances, something that leaves Abbott at least theoretically in peril of being sentenced to jail. Seiler’s claim is accurate but needs clarification or additional information, so we rate it Mostly True.	None	Jack Seiler	None	None	None	2014-11-17T14:58:25	2014-11-05	['None']
pomt-12457	"Nobody on Medicaid" will have their benefits taken away.	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2017/may/09/kevin-mccarthy/would-republican-health-care-bill-take-away-anyone/	Soon after narrowly passing a major health care bill, Republican House members took to the airwaves to put a positive spin on a bill that critics say will roll back coverage for America’s poorest and most vulnerable. "We’re not taking a benefit away. Nobody on Medicaid is going to be taken away," Rep. Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., told CNN May 4. Compared with current law, the Republican plan is projected to reduce federal Medicaid spending by $880 billion, or 25 percent, over the next decade and reduce enrollment by 14 million, or 17 percent, according to the an analysis of an early version of the bill from the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, or CBO. When we asked McCarthy’s office whether these steep cuts would cause any states to pare down their Medicaid programs, his spokesman Matt Sparks replied, "That is a decision that states will have to make." Sparks added, "Regarding Medicaid, there are no changes until 2020. Then states will continue to receive the enhanced federal match for current enrollees." Given the dramatic financing and enrollment changes contemplated in the bill, we decided to look into McCarthy’s claim, with a focus on the bill’s impact on state Medicaid enrollment. We found the changes will almost certainly result in reduced enrollment. Ending more generous federal cost-sharing A key feature of the the Affordable Care Act, or Obamacare, is the option for states to expand Medicaid with generous federal cost-sharing. Thirty-one states plus D.C. have opted to make Medicaid benefits more widely available to their residents. Obamacare allowed states to extend Medicaid benefits to all adults making up to 138 percent of the federal poverty line. In exchange, the federal government covers 90 percent or more of the cost of newly-eligible Medicaid recipients. The portion of funding shouldered by the federal government is known as the "federal match rate." Critics have pounced on the Republican bill for choking off the Obamacare Medicaid expansion by lowering the federal match rate for those who are new to the program. Under the bill, the 90 percent federal match rate drops to its pre-Obamacare average of about 57 percent in 2020 for new applicants. The bill "grandfathers in" the higher match rate for those who enrolled under Obamacare and maintain continuous coverage. But based on historical data, the CBO estimates more than two-thirds of this group would lose coverage due to churn within two years, and that 95 percent would lose their grandfathered-in status by the end of 2024. McCarthy spokesman Sparks was careful to note that the congressman was only referring to "current enrollees." But the fact is about 10.5 million of the the roughly 11 million low-income enrollees who now enjoy enhanced federal matching would lose it by 2025. Impact on states If the House bill becomes law, expansion states would immediately face the thorny question of whether to continue expanded coverage without the federal government’s added boost -- at an average cost increase of 33 percent. Some states actually have trigger laws on the books -- that predate the Republican bill’s passage -- that say federal cuts would legally force the state to end Medicaid expansion. According to the liberal Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, lowering the federal match rate would automatically end or curtail expansion in seven states -- Arkansas, Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, New Hampshire, New Mexico, and Washington. "Laws in these states either explicitly require the expansion to end if the federal Medicaid matching rate decreases, or they require the state to take action to prevent an increase in state Medicaid costs," according to a paper by the center. The group said that some 2.6 million newly-eligible adults would immediately lose coverage under this scenario. Other states might curtail coverage even without state law. Health policy experts in Pennsylvania, West Virginia, New Jersey and Ohio quoted in a May 4 article in Modern Healthcare magazine predicted that their states would end their coverage expansions if the current Republican plan became law. "It's almost beyond imagination that Pennsylvania's Medicaid expansion could survive the reduction in enhanced federal funding," Andy Carter, CEO of the Hospital and Healthsystem Association of Pennsylvania, told Modern Healthcare, adding that Pennsylvania, which already faces a $3 billion budget deficit, would have to come up with $2 billion to $3 billion just to replace lost federal funding. Additionally, a chorus of governors have expressed uneasiness about the proposed changes to Medicaid, with some warning that federal cuts are tantamount to ending the Medicaid expansion. "They are going to eliminate Medicaid expansion," Ohio Gov. John Kasich told CNN May 7. "In Medicaid, you are going to knock all these people off after 2020, which is just a few years away, these people who now are getting covered across the country." Our ruling McCarthy said, "We’re not taking a benefit away. Nobody on Medicaid is going to be taken away." Technically, the bill passed in the House would not directly strip Medicaid coverage from people who currently have it. It would ultimately be up to states to take away Medicaid coverage from current beneficiaries. But the House bill, if enacted in its present form, would at the very least force some states to pull out of Medicaid expansion due to trigger laws that would go into effect if the federal contribution dries up. Blaming the states rather than the House bill for the loss of Medicaid coverage amounts to an exercise in blame-shifting. More broadly, the CBO, health policy experts and governors have warned that the federal Medicaid cuts in the Republican plan would start a domino effect that ends with millions of people covered under expanded Medicaid losing their benefits.

pomt-12299	"Remember, Obamacare created a new category of eligibility. Working-age, able-bodied adults with no dependents for the first time became eligible for Medicaid if their income is below 138 percent of the poverty level. We’re going to continue that eligibility. No one loses coverage."	half-true	/pennsylvania/statements/2017/jun/27/pat-toomey/toomey-conflates-two-things-latest-health-care-cla/	U.S. Sen. Pat Toomey of Pennsylvania has made clear he supports the Senate’s new health care bill, which is expected to be voted on this week. The Republican said on CBS’s "Face the Nation" Sunday the plan would "make permanent" Medicaid expansion and that the federal government would "pay the lion’s share of the cost." "Remember, Obamacare created a new category of eligibility," Toomey continued. "Working-age, able-bodied adults with no dependents for the first time became eligible for Medicaid if their income is below 138 percent of the poverty level. We’re going to continue that eligibility. No one loses coverage." What did Toomey mean by "no one loses coverage?" And how will the Senate plan affect coverage for people who became eligible for Medicaid under Obamacare? Steve Kelly, Toomey’s press secretary, said that when the Senator said "no one loses coverage" he was referring to federal eligibility for expanded Medicaid and was not saying no single person would lose coverage. Sara Rosenbaum, the Harold and Jane Hirsh Professor of Health Law at George Washington, said Toomey "conflates two things." She said the Medicaid eligibility category for adults below 138 percent of the federal poverty level was continued. "But of course what he glosses over is what states will continue to cover these adults once the money starts disappearing," Rosenbaum said. Under the Senate plan — similar to the House plan — the federal government will shift from paying about 90 percent of the cost for this new class of adults eligible for Medicaid to paying the state average for other classes of Medicaid recipients, about 57 percent (it would be 52 percent in Pennsylvania). The shift happens gradually, staying at the current rate through 2020 before dropping gradually: 85 percent in 2021 80 percent in 2022 75 percent in 2023 57 percent in 2024 "We think the Medicaid program is a generous partnership for states," said Theo Merkel, a Toomey legislative assistant. "They are paid well over half of the cost for these individuals, and we think that over seven years if you phase in this transition and [the federal government] is still paying over half, it’s unlikely states are going to turn around and cut eligibility for like, in the case of Pennsylvania, 700,000 individuals." Under the Obamacare expansion, about 700,000 Pennsylvanians newly enrolled in Medicaid. The Urban Institute estimates the reduction of federal enhancement money to the state average in Pennsylvania to be about $1.75 billion annually under the AHCA plan, which senior research analyst Matthew Buettgens said would be comparable to the Senate plan. Buettgens said moving a greater amount of the cost burden to states would leave them with difficult choices. To make up for the shortfall, they’d likely either have to raise taxes, pay providers less or cut Medicaid benefits. He said failure or inability to do so could lead to a loss in coverage for some individuals. "Basically if states aren’t willing to raise taxes, pay providers less or cut benefits they will have to cut enrollment," Buettgens said. Rosenbaum said some states would likely make up for the increased costs and others wouldn’t, as the CBO projected for the House health care bill. "But the notion that these people will continue to have Medicaid is just absurd," Rosenbaum said. "It rests on an assumption states will keep covering people as they are today once the enhancement money is gone." Our Ruling On "Face The Nation," Sen. Pat Toomey said, "Remember, Obamacare created a new category of eligibility. Working-age, able-bodied adults with no dependents for the first time became eligible for Medicaid if their income is below 138 percent of the poverty level. We’re going to continue that eligibility. No one loses coverage." Toomey’s staff said the senator was referring to federal eligibility for that class of adults when he said "no one loses coverage." But Toomey did not clearly state nobody would lose eligibility under the Senate plan. He said "no one loses coverage," leaving his comment open for multiple interpretations. As Rosenbaum said, "Senator Toomey conflates two things." So Toomey is correct that eligibility for a certain class of adults who qualify for Medicaid under Obamacare and previously hadn’t continues under the Senate plan. But it’s possible, even likely, individuals enrolled in Medicaid under the Obama expansion would lose coverage if states decline to cover the shortfall they’ll face after the federal government reduces its share of expanded Medicaid costs.

pomt-00911	The measles vaccine has killed 108 people in the last decade, while no one has died of measles.	false	/georgia/statements/2015/mar/03/naturalnewscom/vaccine-claim-misinterprets-data/	The current measles outbreak has prompted some scientific-sounding claims about the dangers of vaccines. PolitiFact Georgia already ruled Pants On Fire to an outlandish statement reviving the threat of "mercury" in childhood vaccines, particularly the MMR shot for measles, mumps and rubella. Some readers challenged that conclusion, citing the experts in our backyard, at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The gist of the argument comes from a headline over a story from the same alternative-health site as our first claim, NaturalNews.com. "Measles vaccines kill more people than measles, CDC data proves," the headline reads. The story gives precise numbers: The CDC, it says, has reported no deaths from the virus in a decade, while "at least 108 deaths" have been linked to measles vaccines according to the government’s Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System. It would be front-page news – not to mention a flood of "I told you so" Facebook posts – if, in fact, children were more than 100 times more likely to die from measles vaccines than the disease itself. The reason it isn’t? No grand conspiracy. Just a misreading of data. First, let’s agree that the data should only include cases or deaths in the United States. After all, measles remains among the leading causes of death for young children worldwide, killing 145,700 in 2013, according to the World Health Organization. The fate of children and adults in the United States is much better. The CDC’s National Vital Statistics Report data show measles as the cause of death five times between 2004 and 2010, the last year information is available. That breaks down to two cases each in 2009 and 2010, and one in 2005. And, according to the data, only the 2005 death was that of a child. However, even that low number might be an overstatement. A spokesman for the CDC’s National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases said those tallies sometimes report underlying causes, which do not always represent deaths associated with acute measles infection. Officially, the CDC shows the last verifiable deaths in the U.S. from acute measles were in 2003, when a 13-year-old boy and a 75-year-old man died, according to spokesman Mike Sennett. So that puts the half of the claim in line with the CDC’s stance. The other half – about more than 100 deaths from the four different measles vaccines – is the problem. Those figures come from searches of the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS), an online database co-sponsored by the CDC, U.S. Food and Drug Administration and agencies of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. Significantly, anyone can file a report with VAERS: doctors, patients, family members, friends, "even if the reporter cannot be certain that the event was caused by the vaccine." That is important to know when running a search of the VAERS database for the past decade. That data reveal 105 deaths following one of the four measles vaccines. From the most common MMR vaccine, the count is 96. But remember, the system is designed to capture as much information as possible. Tallying a death that happened after a measles vaccine is not the same as confirming that the shot was the cause. (When available, causes of death after the measles vaccines range from existing heart conditions to co-sleeping to drowning.) Researchers want that information to review and study for patterns, said Dr. Walter A. Orenstein, a pediatrician and associate director of the Emory Vaccine Center who spent 16 years as the head of the CDC’s national immunization program. Government researchers constantly examine every report, on an ongoing basis. They turn over anything suspicious to outside groups, such as the Institute of Medicine, for deeper analysis. "There is a very comprehensive review to look at vaccine safety," Orenstein said. "After all, we give our own children these vaccines." The review on the measles vaccines is clear: There have been no deaths attributed to the shots. In fact, none of the measles vaccines have prompted concern. Others have, most notably a rotovirus vaccine that VAERS data suggested increased risk for bowel blockages. That vaccine was pulled from the market in 1999. It has since been replaced by two similar vaccines that more effectively keep children from being hospitalized with severe diarrhea – though the blockages called intussusception remain a slight risk. "The policy comes in, as weighing the risks and benefits of a vaccine," said Dr. Frank DeStefano, the director of the Immunization Safety Office the CDC. That is to say, the research allows for informed decision making when recommending vaccines. For the MMR vaccine, and others, there are known complications. Most common, DeStefano said, is anaphylaxis, a severe allergic reaction that will affect one out of every 1 million to 2 million children. Those children are usually allergic to components of the vaccine, such as gelatin or egg proteins, not the viral antigen itself. The complications from measles, meanwhile, are far more common. According to the book "Vaccines" by Peter M. Strebel, pneumonia occurs in 1 to 6 percent of cases, ear infections occur 7 to 9 percent of the time and diarrhea occurs in about in about 8 percent of cases. Encephalitis, a potentially deadly brain swelling, occurs in 1 out of every 1,000 to 2,000 kids with the disease. An almost always lethal form of encephalitis occurs years after an infection in 1 to 3 kids for every 1,000 cases. To scientists, those complications make it clear that the vaccine's benefits far outweigh its risks, and certainly outweigh the risks of a highly contagious disease. The NaturalNews site claims that at least 108 children have died from the measles vaccine in the past decade, while none have died of the disease itself. That’s wildly inaccurate. There have been reports of death in children following the vaccine, but that does not equal deaths caused by the vaccine. There are no confirmed deaths caused by the measles vaccines. The more accurate comparison, DeStefano suggests, is that big fat zero versus the 300-400 children who died annually in the United States before the vaccine was available in the 1960s. We agree. The article misreads data, to suggest that the measles vaccine is a greater threat to children than the disease. Experts, and data, show that measles is far more dangerous than the vaccine, even if some kids do have a reaction to the shot. We rate the claim False.

pomt-05479	Says Ellen Rosenblum "has said over and over again that this is a job where 80 percent of the job is being the government’s lawyer."	half-true	/oregon/statements/2012/apr/19/dwight-holton/did-ellen-rosenblum-say-80-percent-attorney-genera/	Oregon is likely to pick its new attorney general in May. No Republicans are running for the office. Two Democrats are running this spring and will face any third party opposition in the fall. So far it’s been a low-profile contest. But the candidates, Ellen Rosenblum and Dwight Holton, have traded several barbs. Holton, for example, says that Rosenblum has repeatedly claimed that the job of being the state’s top prosecutor is mostly being a government attorney, and not an advocate. "She has said over and over again that this is a job where 80 percent of the job is being the government’s lawyer. I just don’t believe that. This is the Oregon Department of Justice and I take that word justice very seriously," Holton said in a radio interview with 1190 KEX. Apparently Holton means it in a negative way and the Rosenblum camp takes it as such. "What Dwight is doing over and over is using that 80 percent number to inaccurately portray her as a candidate that doesn't understand the role and is just a bureaucrat," says Cynara Lilly, spokeswoman for the Rosenblum campaign. A campaign barb under protest is fair game for PolitiFact Oregon. Did Rosenblum say it? Over and over? And what was the context in which she made the statement? The Holton camp helpfully directed us to a radio interview Rosenblum conducted in January, with 620 KPOJ. The host asked her to explain the job of attorney general to audience members unfamiliar with the role. "Well I think a lot of people don’t realize that about 80 percent of the work of the attorney general is representing the government agencies, and which in essence means representing the governor …" she said in response. Rosenblum repeats the figure one more in that interview. And in response to a question on how she might distinguish herself from current Attorney General John Kroger, she said, "I would definitely want to focus on the highest quality of the advice that we give to the government agencies." There’s no question Rosenblum made the point more than once. She may have repeated the figure elsewhere, as Holton’s people suggest although Rosenblum’s people deny that. (However, Rosenblum and her spokeswoman also denied she said it in the first place, and that is inaccurate.) Still, here’s the part that really trips us up. In that same January interview, Rosenblum talked about what she would emphasize, that the public may not know: Consumer protection, financial fraud, helping district attorneys, environmental protection, small businesses, and fighting for workers, children, families. In that way, she hit the same notes as Holton. "The attorney general also is involved in so many areas and those that I would emphasize would include child advocacy," she said about two minutes in. "I don’t think a lot of people realize that about 300 employees of the attorney general’s office collect child support for those who are in arrears or on behalf of those whose exes or whoever have not kept up with their payments ." We raised the issue with the Holton campaign. Is it fair to cherry-pick one statement to pound the point that the opponent has acknowledged the job is being the state’s lawyer, which it is? "What we're talking about here is the difference in the vision of the job of attorney general," said Jillian Schoene, a Holton spokeswoman. Schoene passed along this comment from her boss: "Providing excellent legal advice is a core mission -- but in my view, if that is all you do, you've failed -- because the attorney general ought to go to work each day to fight for families, not just answer the phone and provide legal advice," he said. But that’s clearly not what Rosenblum has said or is saying. She’s not saying that’s all she’ll do. Holton’s statement is partially accurate in that Rosenblum did describe the job of attorney general as 80 percent government work. But there are important details missing: She said in the same interview that she would advocate on behalf of children, consumers, the environment and small businesses. We also think it would be impossible for Holton to wiggle out of representing state government if he is elected. We find Holton’s statement Half True.

pomt-00941	Last year, "we saw the first reduction in the federal prison population in 32 years."	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/feb/23/eric-holder/federal-prison-population-drops-first-time-3-decad/	Federal prisons recently hit a notable benchmark, outgoing Attorney General Eric Holder said earlier this week. In remarks at the National Press Club on Feb. 17, 2015, Holder made the case for sentencing reform and touted the Smart on Crime initiative on his watch. That program discourages federal prosecutors from pursuing harsh minimum sentences for low-level, non-violent drug criminals. "This newly unveiled data shows we can confront over-incarceration at the same time that we continue to promote public safety," he said. "Already, in fiscal year 2014, we saw the first reduction in the federal prison population in 32 years." The federal prison population has swelled dramatically since the early 1980s, due in large part to the prosecution of drug-related crimes, so we thought we’d double-check Holder’s statistics. In 1980, the federal prison population was about 24,000. It had hovered around that number since the 1940s. By December 2013 (which came within the federal government’s 2014 fiscal year), federal prisons held about 216,000 inmates, according to the Bureau of Justice Statistics. That was down by nearly 2,000 inmates from a peak of roughly 218,000 than the year before. That’s a tiny decline -- less than 1 percent, after a nine-fold increase between 1980 and 2013 -- but it’s still the first time the federal prison population had dropped since 1980, the BJS reports. The solid red line in this Bureau of Justice Statistics graph shows the trend: The drop may eventually grow larger. When he first announced this decline back in September, Holder said internal projections showed a drop of 10,000 federal inmates by fiscal year 2016. We’ll note a few minor quibbles. The decline is actually the first in 33 years not 32, as Holder said. And Holder refers fiscal years, but the best data we could get our hands on goes by calendar year. The reality is that the prison population fluctuates daily, so any figure used for the current period is going to vary a bit. So we won’t count these factors against Holder. Perhaps more interesting than the drop itself is the reason why. One possible factor is the 2010 Fair Sentencing Act, which sought to remove sentencing discrepancies between crack and powder cocaine-related crimes, and eliminated a five-year mandatory minimum sentence for crack possession. Experts said that a contributing factor to the projected future decline is the U.S. Sentencing Commission’s July 2014 decision to allow the possibility of retroactively reduced sentences for individuals incarcerated on drug charges. This potentially affects 50,000 federal inmates. Let’s also put the decline into context. In reality, the federal inmate decline isn’t putting a huge dent into the nation’s prison population. Federal prisoners made up just 12 percent of the nation’s prison population in 2013, according to the BJS report, with those in state prisons and local jails accounting for the other 88 percent. Indeed, the federal decline was actually wiped out -- and then some -- by an increase of 5,000 inmates in the state prison population. Still, the U.S. population as a whole grew faster than the inmate population, meaning that the country’s overall imprisonment rate declined in 2013. "While the national prison population suggests a modest increase in the incarcerated population, the picture in some states is more drastic," said a report out of New York University’s Brennan Center for Justice. A report by the Prison Policy Initiative agreed, saying, "We can’t end our nation’s experiment with mass incarceration without grappling with the wide variety of state-level criminal justice policies, practices and trends." Finally, we’ll note that, despite the decline, federal prisons remain overcrowded. Medium- and high-security facilities are operating at 40 percent and 50 percent above capacity, respectively, according to the Bureau of Prisons. Our ruling Holder said that last year, "we saw the first reduction in the federal prison population in 32 years." The statistics show that Holder is correct. While it’s worth noting that the state prison population wiped out that decline, Holder worded his claim carefully, and federal prisons are the only ones in his portfolio. So we rate it True. Correction, Feb. 24, 2015, 10:30 a.m.: An earlier version of this article said that a policy change that retroactively reduced sentences for certain prisoners convicted on drug charges played a role in the decline of the federal prison population in 2013. However, that policy change came in 2014 and is only going to affect populations in future years. The article has been updated to reflect this discrepancy. The change does not affect the ruling.

pomt-02196	The Bundy Ranch deal is all about Nevada Sen. Harry Reid "using federal violence to take people’s land in his state so he can package it to re-sell it to the Chinese."	pants on fire!	/punditfact/statements/2014/apr/24/blog-posting/did-sen-harry-reid-drive-standoff-bundy-ranch-pers/	The furor over Cliven Bundy’s cows in Nevada has churned up some powerful speculation about the murky forces at play. A long-running effort by the federal Bureau of Land Management to stop Bundy from letting his cattle forage without paying any grazing fees (on land that was off-limits to grazing in any event) turned into a standoff between federal agents and Bundy’s supporters, both well armed. Out of that drama came the assertion that Nevada Democratic Sen. Harry Reid was behind it all and the goal was personal gain. Reid publicly endorsed federal action against Bundy. A tea party website Republic Broadcasting Network out of Texas put it succinctly. "It’s very simple. Harry Reid, senator from Nevada, is using federal violence to take people’s land in his state so he can package it to re-sell it to the Chinese. That’s what the Bundy Ranch deal is all about." This claim and its cousins have been debunked before (a tip of the hat to Snopes). Here’s the gist of its flaws: The government had no interest in Bundy’s property. It wanted his cattle off government land. Reid’s son had represented a Chinese firm that had been interested in developing a solar energy array, but the deal involved land far from the Bundy property and collapsed a year ago. The Bureau of Land Management has identified a desert area for solar power development, but it is about 50 miles away from both the Bundy ranch and the federal land where he likes to graze his cattle. The habitat protections on the land Bundy wants to use were put in place in 1994, long before there was any hint of Chinese interest. Reid's accusers posted an interview with Fabian Calvo, a Los Angeles real estate agent, as evidence to back up their inaccurate claim. Calvo connected the dots between Reid, his son Rory and the Bureau of Land Management. "Reid’s son is involved with BLM customers, putting together deals right where Clive Bundy’s ranch is," Calvo said. "The federal government is ready to send armed guards in to take peoples land, unconstitutionally, illegally, over what I believe is making sweetheart deals to the Chinese." An editorial in Investors Business Daily hinted darkly that on March 14, the BLM announced support for the Western Solar Energy Plan. "Coincidentally, part of that solar energy expansion includes a plan by China's ENN Energy Group to build what would be America's largest solar energy complex," the editorial said. "The site chosen with the guidance of Reid's son, Rory, is in Laughlin, Nev. Laughlin is in Clark County, where Bundy's ranch is." Clark County covers more than 8,000 square miles. Laughlin is about 100 miles as the crow flies from Bundy’s ranch. As for the ENN Energy Group, there had been a plan to turn 9,000 acres into the nation’s largest solar array. According to press reports, Reid’s son Rory did represent the company, and Reid himself helped recruit the company during a trip to China in 2011. But the deal hinged on nailing down long-term contracts to sell the power the massive facility would generate. When the developers were unable to get those agreements, they backed out. That was in July 2013. Looking at the BLM’s efforts to use federal lands as sites for solar energy, the agency released a list of 17 designated areas in 2012. The Dry Lake Solar Energy Zone is closest to Bundy’s ranch, but that doesn’t make it his neighbor. It is about 5,700 acres large but its closest border is at least 50 miles to the west of Bundy’s property. The BLM did invite energy companies to submit proposals in mid March. This was the final step in a two-year process aimed at managing the environmental impacts of any development that might take place in these zones. That environmental assessment provides one possible link to Bundy and his cows. In order to offset the loss of natural habitat in the development zone, the government typically preserves or restores the same kind of habitat someplace else. The Dry Lake area is home to the desert tortoise, a threatened species. Mike Connor is with the Western Watersheds Project, an environmental conservation group. Connor said Nevada has four areas designated as Areas of Critical Environmental Concern (ACEC) to protect the desert tortoise. One of those is Gold Butte. That’s the federal land where Bundy has been grazing his cattle. Some of Bundy’s defenders have said that blocking him from Gold Butte would make it easier to build at Dry Lake. "That really wouldn’t make any sense," Connor said. "Gold Butte was set aside as an ACEC in 1994. You can’t use the same land twice to protect the same habitat. There really is no connection between what’s going on at Dry Lake and what’s going on at Gold Butte." Our ruling The Republic Broadcasting Network said Sen. Reid was behind the use of force to take away Bundy’s land and sell it to the Chinese. There is nothing accurate about this claim. The dispute involved Bundy’s long use of federal land without a permit. The land gained protected status long before solar energy projects were on the table. The Chinese solar energy proposal no longer exists. The land where such projects might be developed are far from Bundy’s property. We rate this claim Pants on Fire.

pomt-01843	Says attorney general candidate Jon Richards "went so far to say he would only enforce the laws with which he personally agreed."	false	/wisconsin/statements/2014/jul/16/brad-schimel/democratic-candidate-attorney-general-would-only-d/	"Lawlessness" was the subject of a June 26, 2014 fund-raising email that Brad Schimel, the lone Republican running for Wisconsin attorney general, sent to his supporters. He attacked President Barack Obama as well as the three Democratic candidates for attorney general, singling out one of them in particular. "Like President Obama, my Democrat opponents have no respect for the Constitution or rule of law," Schimel wrote. "In fact, one of my opponents went so far to say he would only enforce the laws with which he personally agreed." Schimel's campaign confirmed the reference was to state Rep. Jon Richards, D-Milwaukee. It’s an extreme claim. Has Richards said he would only enforce laws he agrees with? The AG race Richards and two district attorneys -- Susan Happ of Jefferson County and Ismael Ozanne of Dane County -- will compete in the Aug. 12, 2014 primary, with the winner facing Schimel, the Waukesha County district attorney, in the Nov. 4, 2014 general election. Republican incumbent J.B. Van Hollen is not seeking a third four-year term. All four candidates have stated they wouldn’t defend certain laws, saying they violate the state or U.S. constitution. That could saddle taxpayers with higher costs because private attorneys could be brought in to do that work. The three Democrats said they wouldn't defend or appeal rulings on the state's ban on gay marriage, its voter ID law, or recent abortion regulations. Schimel said he would not defend Wisconsin's domestic partnership law, which gives same-sex couples some of the rights of married couples. Those positions drew criticism from Madison lawyer Lester Pines, who supports Ozanne in the attorney general race. After social conservatives in 2009 sued to block the domestic partnership law, Van Hollen refused to defend it. Democratic Gov. Jim Doyle then hired Pines to defend the law. Wisconsin's attorney general has a legal and professional duty to defend every state law unless the only arguments that can be made on its behalf are frivolous, Pines told the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel in a June 14, 2014 article. Disliking a law or even believing a law is unconstitutional, he said, is not enough to abandon the duty to defend it. Schimel's claim Asked to provide evidence for Schimel’s claim, campaign manager Johnny Koremenos argued that Richards has two standards in deciding whether to defend a law, "the Constitution and the ‘wishes of the people.’" "This signals he will disregard the law and replace it with his perception of the ‘wishes of the people,’" Koremenos said. "It’s clear he is willing to place his own values and personal beliefs above the Constitution." Koremenos also cited several news articles. But only two of them, both from February 2014, contain comments from Richards about his personal beliefs. And in neither case does Richards say he would enforce only laws he agrees with. First, an article in the Madison weekly newspaper Isthmus -- about whether efforts to repeal Wisconsin’s ban on gay marriage could benefit Democrats in the fall 2014 elections -- noted that Richards said in a news release he would not defend the state’s ban on same-sex marriage, which voters added to the state constitution in 2006. Richards has said he believes the ban violates the U.S. constitution and that he personally favors allowing same-sex marriage. "Given Richards’ proactive stance, it's clear he doesn’t see same-sex marriage as a negative on the campaign trail," the Isthmus article stated. The article also said Richards’ political director, Andy Suchorski, did not disagree with this assessment, but that Richards’ position is "not a political thing for him. It’s something he really believes. It’s why we’re pushing it.’" That might seem like support for Schimel’s claim. But only regarding one law and only if taken out of context. Suchorski told us he had been asked a political question -- whether Richards was talking about gay marriage in the campaign because it was good for Democrats -- and had not been asked any legal questions. And the article itself is framed as a political analysis. Schimel also pointed to the first paragraph of a brief version of an Associated Press news story, which stated Richards had pledged to be "the people’s attorney general" if elected, and that he said Richards wouldn’t defend every state law if he thinks it violates the U.S. Constitution or goes against the wishes of the people. So, that’s an indication that Richards might not defend some laws if he thinks they are against the public’s wishes, but not that he would defend only laws he supports. Indeed, the full version of the AP article noted that Richards said he would defend laws with which he disagrees, though he didn’t provide an example during that particular news conference. However, despite Schimel’s claim, Richards has actually stated that he would defend laws he doesn’t support if he believes they are constitutional. Richards campaign spokesman Sachin Chheda pointed to three such occasions: In March 2014, Richards told the Waukesha Freeman newspaper: "There are going to be times when there are laws that I voted against and personally might not support but I believe are consistent with the state and United States constitution, so, of course, the Department of Justice will defend them in that situation." In January 2014 on the "Upfront with Mike Gousha" public affairs TV show, Richards was asked if he would vigorously enforce the state’s voter ID law if it is upheld in court. Richards called the law "troubling," but said: "Obviously, If the law is passed, and a court rules that it’s constitutional, we’ll uphold the law, of course. But I do think the law that’s written really needs some scrutiny." Also in January 2014, Richards was asked by WisPolitics.com if concealed carry "is the right thing for Wisconsin." Richards said several aspects of the law were "problematic" in terms of public safety, but he added: "Having said that, I mean, the law is in place and as attorney general I would certainly work to make sure that if people apply for a concealed weapons permit, that it’s handled in a professional manner, quickly and expeditiously, and that we obey the law and we get those permits issued." Our rating Schimel said Richards "went so far to say he would only enforce the laws with which he personally agreed." He provides no evidence that Richards made such a statement. On the contrary, Richards has said on multiple occasions he would enforce laws with which he doesn’t agree. We rate Schimel’s statement False.

pomt-07798	On high-speed rail.	full flop	/florida/statements/2011/feb/18/mike-haridopolos/haridopolos-breaks-silence-high-speed-rail-then-sw/	When Florida Gov. Rick Scott announced on Feb. 16, 2011, that he would reject $2.4 billion in federal funds for a bullet train from Orlando to Tampa, many Republican and Democratic legislators immediately criticized him for acting too hastily. Some conservatives praised the governor for sticking to his anti-spending principles, and a handful of Republicans offered tepid statements that resembled support for Scott. Kind of, anyway. Then there was Republican Senate President Mike Haridopolos, a candidate for U.S. Senate in 2012. Haridopolos said -- nothing. Crickets. For two days, nothing. Finally, on Feb. 18, Haridopolos issued a written statement. He was siding with Scott. "From the beginning, I have made it clear that Florida will cut $3.62 billion in spending this year and balance its state budget without raising taxes. We will not finance our future. We have also said that under no circumstances would we use state dollars, needed to support priorities like education, to pay for high-speed rail. For Floridians, that would be unforgivable. "Florida is leading by example in keeping its fiscal house in order. We must demand the same from Washington. To President Obama and all members of Congress, I say we are far better off reducing the $1.5 trillion in proposed deficit spending by this $2.4 billion than we are to build a rail project that has a questionable, at-best, economic viability." Haridopolos' position -- against the high-speed rail project -- seemed at odds with his previous words and votes, PolitiFact Florida readers told us. So we decided to run Haridopolos' statements and position on the high-speed rail project through our Flip-O-Meter. The story for us starts in 2009, when the Legislature met in special session to consider a rail package that supporters claimed was critical to Florida winning billions of dollars in federal funds for high-speed rail. The bill that was considered, passed and signed into law by Gov. Charlie Crist included major rail components, beyond just the Tampa to Orlando line. The law created two state entities to oversee passenger rail systems across Florida. The law shifted $60 million a year to finance rail projects starting in 2014, and increased the state subsidy to the Tri-Rail commuter line in South Florida by up to $15 million from the current $27 million. It created the framework for Florida to pledge $280 million in state money to receive federal funds for the Tampa/Orlando line. And it allowed the state to purchase 61.5 miles of CSX railroad track for $432 million to construct a SunRail commuter system in the Orlando area. During the week of debate, it was the SunRail component of the legislation that was most controversial. Opponents argued SunRail was too costly, too good of a deal for CSX and not ultimately necessary to win the billions of dollars in federal aid. Another concern: liability provisions that would leave taxpayers on the hook for accidents caused by CSX, which would share the track. We checked long and hard to see what Haridopolos had to say about the legislation, and found virtually nothing. We checked with veteran reporters in the Tallahassee press corps who remembered Haridopolos for being largely silent. We found this bland tweet from Haridopolos, @MikeHaridopolos, during the debate on Dec. 3, 2009: "Interesting debate on rail issue here in Florida Senate today." And we found an editorial on Dec. 8 from the Orlando Sentinel asking "where's the leadership from Mike Haridopolos," who at the time was in line to become Senate president. But when it came down to the vote, a silent Haridopolos voted yes on the rail package. The 2010-11 state budget included $131 million to develop the Tampa/Orlando rail line. And again, Haridopolos voted yes. Haridopolos started talking more critically about rail in October 2010. He suggested that Democratic candidate for governor Alex Sink had proposed $12.5 billion in new state spending, including $9 billion for supporting a high-speed rail project from Orlando to Miami. The Orlando/Miami line was to come after the Orlando/Tampa line was completed. (We ruled the claim about Sink's spending plans False.) But then in November, a Haridopolos spokesman told the Sentinel that Haridopolos still supported the Tampa/Orlando high-speed train. Bush said Haridopolos planned to meet with then Gov.-elect Scott to "get his thoughts on high-speed rail for this state." The yo-yoing continued in January, when Haridopolos said he supported the Tampa/Orlando line, as long as the state didn't have to pay for it, and that private companies picked up the state's $280 million required share. "I think rail, or in this case, high-speed rail, is something that people would like to have," Haridopolos said. "I would make the argument … it's something that we cannot afford at this point using state dollars. If the private sector chooses to make up that last 10 percent, great." The private sector, however, will never get that chance, it appears, as Scott on Feb. 16 signaled the death of the project before bids were issued to build the 84-mile line. And then to cap it off, Haridopolos agreed with him. Haridopolos' position is a bit of a head-scratcher. He was silent and voted for the bills, and stayed silent for almost a year. Then, all of the sudden, he was worried about the cost to taxpayers (after agreeing to spend money in the state budget). Then he wanted to try to get the private sector to pick up the state's tab, but before they could try, Haridopolos agreed with Scott's decision to effectively short-circuit the process. We think there's enough inconsistency there to rate Haridopolos' position on high-speed rail a Full Flop. Correction: An earlier version of this story referred to a spokesman of Mike Haridopolos by the wrong name.	None	Mike Haridopolos	None	None	None	2011-02-18T16:37:33	2011-02-18	['None']
pomt-09831	"Any government-run 'public' plan ... creates an entitlement that will cost another $1 trillion over the next 10 years."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/aug/26/ginny-brown-waite/health-reform-costs-1-trillion-over-10-years/	Rep. Ginny Brown-Waite sent a mailer to constituents explaining her opposition to the Democratic health care reform plan. "Unfortunately, I believe the legislation currently being considered in the House of Representatives could spark the government takeover of health care," she wrote. "The American people will have fewer choices, rationed care and higher costs. This is the last thing we need right now." Brown-Waite, a Florida Republican, also lists bullet points for why she opposes reform: "Any Government-Run 'Public' Plan - Why it's the WRONG solution to America's Health Care Problems - Creates an entitlement that will cost another $1 trillion over the next 10 years, on top of the trillions the government is already planning to spend on health care." We found the phrasing here odd. As we've noted before , the Democratic plans for health reform leave employer-provided insurance in place. The House bill seeks to make it easier for individuals to buy health insurance on their own by creating a national health care exchange, a kind of one-stop shop for health insurance. One of the plans on the exchange will be a government-run plan that provides basic coverage at a price likely to be lower than private insurers. (For a fuller explanation of the basics of health care reform, read our story Health care reform: a simple explanation .) It's not correct to characterize the overall health bill as a "government-run 'public' plan." Rather, the government will run one of the insurance plans, and people can choose to buy it or not. Nevertheless, if we're talking about the overall bill, Brown-Waite is correct about its cost. The Congressional Budget Office has determined that the overall health care reform bill from the House would cost $1 trillion over 10 years. The bill includes cost-saving measures and tax increases on the wealthy, so its impact on the deficit would be lower: $239 billion over 10 years, according to the CBO. If you're wondering how much the public option alone would cost, we're not sure. Obama has said he wants the public option to be self-supporting through the premiums it charges its customers. But the public option would need, at a minimum, some sort of seed money to get going. The CBO estimated all the costs associated with "exchange subsidies," and that came to $773 billion, but that includes tax credits (called "affordability credits") to help people of modest means buy insurance on the exchange, and they might or might not choose the public option. We also want to address Brown-Waite's statement that the health plan "creates an entitlement." An entitlement is "a right to benefits mandated by government," and sometimes a euphemism for welfare, according to Safire's Political Dictionary . Strictly speaking, the bill creates entitlements for some people, but not for everyone. As we noted earlier, it gives tax credits to people of modest means, and it expands Medicaid for the poor. We asked Brown-Waite for the reasoning behind her claims on the mailing, but we didn't get a response. In some ways, Brown-Waite's mailer seems like a classic campaign tactic: Take your opponent's position and distort it so that it appears scary or stupid. But in this case, the mailer was paid for with tax dollars. Members of Congress get to mail their constituents without paying postage, a perk known as "franking," and Brown-Waite's mailer clearly states it was "prepared, published and mailed at taxpayer expense." Waite says that "Any Government-Run 'Public' Plan ... Creates an entitlement that will cost another $1 trillion over the next 10 years, on top of the trillions the government is already planning to spend on health care." But, to be clear, the overall health bill is not a "government-run 'public' plan. The public aspect is just a part it, which people can choose to participate in or not. She also offers a confusing way to explain the cost of the health care reform bill, and we want to be clear that $1 trillion includes all aspects of the bill. So we rate her statement Half True.

pomt-11602	On taxes, "if you go back and look 50 years ago, individuals paid about 7 percent of the total and corporations paid 5 percent. Fast forward 50 years: individuals still 7 percent, corporations (are) down to 2 percent."	mostly true	/ohio/statements/2018/jan/30/richard-cordray/richard-cordray-mostly-point-comparing-taxes-paid-/	Richard Cordray, a Democrat running for governor in Ohio who served under the Obama administration, described the tax bill as a "terrible deal" that helps the wealthy. Cordray is one of many competing in the Democratic primary with hopes to succeed term-limited Republican Gov. John Kasich. In a speech to the City Club of Cleveland Dec. 14, Cordray told the audience about his efforts to help consumers and fight big banks while serving as the first director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. When an audience member asked Cordray to weigh in on the federal tax bill that was in the works at the time (it later became law), he said it wouldn’t do enough to help the middle class. "If you go back and look 50 years ago, individuals paid about 7 percent of the total and corporations paid 5 percent. Fast forward 50 years: individuals still 7 percent, corporations (are) down to 2 percent. And yet we are making (it) a priority to give more tax cuts to corporations. There’s slabs for them, there’s crumbs for people like the middle-class people in our society. I think it is wrong." Cordray spokesman Mike Gwin told PolitiFact that Cordray was referring to corporate and individual income tax revenue as a share of U.S. gross domestic product, which wasn’t fully clear from Corday’s comments. We fact-checked Cordray’s historical comparison and found that he was in the ballpark, but his comment required further explanation about how businesses actually end up filing their taxes. Individuals vs. corporations payment on taxes The tax bill signed by President Donald Trump in December will significantly reduce the on-the-books corporate tax rate. The top corporate rate will fall from 35 percent to 21 percent, and the business version of the alternative minimum tax will be repealed. Gwin cited a 2017 chart by the Urban Institute-Brookings Institution Tax Policy Center that shows tax receipts as a percentage of GDP dating back to 1934. The chart is based on historical tables from the U.S. Office of Management and Budget. Gwin said Cordray’s point wasn’t to make comparisons between individual years such as 1967 and 2017 since the numbers fluctuate from year to year, but to make a larger point that over the last 50 years individuals have contributed an increasing share of overall tax revenue, while corporations have paid a decreasing share. Since Cordray mentioned looking back 50 years, we will use 1967 and 2017 as our comparison years, though it wouldn’t change dramatically if we looked at different years in that general range. In 1967, individual income taxes accounted for 7.3 percent of gross domestic product while corporate income taxes accounted for 4.1 percent. The center’s estimate for 2017 shows that individual income taxes now represent a larger share -- 9.3 percent -- while the corporate share has fallen to 2.2 percent. Joel Slemrod, a professor of business economics and public policy at the University of Michigan, said the comparison is broadly accurate -- however, to get to the 5 percent for the corporate tax that Cordray cited would require going back a bit further than 50 years, to 1954. He also said that Cordray’s numbers only apply to federal taxes. Since the United States has had a high corporate tax rate, millions of mid-sized businesses that would have paid the corporate tax have instead used alternative structures to lower their taxes. That resulted in a huge amount of business income shifting from corporations to so-called pass-through entities, said Chris Edwards, director of tax policy studies at the libertarian Cato Institute. "If you look at data the past couple of decades there has been a huge rise in LLCs" and other such entities, Edwards said. "About half of all business income in the U.S. is those pass-through entities that don’t pay the corporate income tax -- they pay through the individual income tax code." The business-backed Tax Foundation compiled data showing the decrease in the number of corporations subject to the corporate income tax and the increase in S corporations paying the individual income tax. Between 1980 and 2012, the number of corporations subject to the corporate income tax fell from 2.2 million to 1.6 million. Meanwhile, the number of S corporations subject to the individual income tax increased from 0.5 million to 4.2 million, with the number of non-corporate businesses increasing dramatically as well, said Scott Greenberg, senior analyst at the Foundation. In 2012, pass-through businesses earned $1.63 trillion in net income, compared to $1.10 trillion of net income earned by C corporations -- the traditional kind of corporation that pays corporate taxes. "As a result, focusing on the corporate income tax, as an indicator for how much American businesses (or even American corporations) are paying in taxes, can be quite misleading," Greenberg said. "Because many businesses have switched away from the C corporate form, and are now taxed under the individual income tax, the comparison between corporate income tax revenue 50 years ago and today is not quite apples-to-apples." Our ruling Cordray said in a speech, "If you go back and look 50 years ago, individuals paid about 7 percent of the total and corporations paid 5 percent. Fast forward 50 years: individuals still 7 percent, corporations (are) down to 2 percent." He was referring to taxes paid as a percentage of GDP, which wasn’t clear from his remarks. And, a growing portion of the individual income tax figure he cites was effectively taxes paid by businesses as "pass-throughs" on individual tax filings. Overall, though, his numbers are in the ballpark. We rate this claim Mostly True. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com	None	Richard Cordray	None	None	None	2018-01-30T09:30:00	2017-12-14	['None']
pomt-11422	Says he didn't take "corporate PAC money."	mostly true	/pennsylvania/statements/2018/mar/17/conor-lamb/conor-lambs-rejection-corporate-pac-money-needs-co/	When Democrat Conor Lamb took the stage inside a Canonsburg ballroom brimming with supporters and news media on election night, he claimed victory in what amounted to one of the massive political upsets of the Trump Era. And he was clear that they’d managed this feat not with the financial backing of corporations, but with a grassroots network and a slew of small-money contributions. "I'm proud that you helped me refuse corporate PAC money," he said to applause. Lamb ran to fill Pennsylvania’s 18th congressional district seat, which was vacated by former U.S. Rep. Tim Murphy, a Republican, late last year. The New York Times and Democrats have called the race for Lamb, though absentee and provisional ballots were still being counted as of Friday, with Lamb leading his Republican opponent, state Rep. Rick Saccone, by hundreds of votes. The darkhorse Democratic candidate raised millions in mostly small, online donations during the campaign — up to 62 percent of them from not just outside of the 18th district, but from outside of the state. But is it true that corporate PAC money played no role in his campaign? According to the Federal Election Commission, Lamb received 99 "discrete PAC contributions" from a total of 81 different PACs. Some of those PACs contributed multiple times. No corporate PAC contributions were reported by his campaign committee, per the FEC. Instead, many of these PACs belong to unions; veterans groups; advocacy groups, such as the JStreet PAC, a self-described "political home for pro-Israel, pro-peace Americans"; and a host of Democratic leadership groups. "He mainly received money from labor PACs and Democratic leadership PACs," said Andrew Mayersohn, a committees researcher with the Center for Responsive Politics. "Labor PACs, obviously, don’t receive money from corporate PACs. Leadership PACs do (usually) take corporate PAC contributions, but I doubt that Lamb will feel indebted to Comcast just because Comcast's PAC gave to [U.S. Rep] Mike Doyle’s leadership PAC last year, and Doyle gave to Lamb’s campaign this year. More likely, he’ll feel indebted to Mike Doyle," Mayersohn said. Adam Bonin, a Philadelphia lawyer specializing in political law compliance and advocacy, said the difference between accepting money from a corporate PAC and a PAC that has received corporate funds — or funds from corporate executives and employees — is significant. "When people refer to corporate PACs, what they mean are PACs established by corporations and funded by their employees with officers and directors who decide where the funds are directed," Bonin said. In Lamb’s case, donations of $200 or less accounted for half of the money — millions of dollars in total — raised by his campaign, according to Anne Feldman, press secretary for End Citizens United, a prominent backer of his campaign. But there were also donations from PACs reliant on support from executives and employees — and their relatives — at some of America’s largest companies and conglomerates. This includes Massachusetts Sen. Joe Kennedy III’s 4MA leadership PAC, which counts individuals with ties to Goldman Sachs, Ford Motor Company, Home Depot and a slew of pharmaceutical companies among its Top 20 contributors, per OpenSecrets.org and the Center for Responsive Politics, the group behind the site. The Keystone Fund PAC, U.S. Rep. Mike Doyle’s political action committee, also donated to Lamb and has top donors with connections to T-Mobile, Comcast, Exelon and Google. Sen. Bob Casey’s Keystone America PAC, another Lamb contributor, has Blue Cross/Blue Shield, Aetna, Johnson & Johnson and Ernst & Young in its Top 20. There’s also AmeriPAC: The Fund for a Greater America, a Lamb donor with contributors tied to Coca-Cola and Boeing, OpenSecrets.org reports. Each of these PACs donated the maximum of $5,000 to Lamb’s campaign. "We group those [individual] contributions with corporate PACs when we talk about industry giving. For example, PNC Bank's PAC and PNC executives are ultimately part of the financial industry's political influence," Mayersohn said of OpenSecret.org’s lists of top PAC donors. "Since most people work for a corporation of some kind, it's pretty hard for a campaign to avoid taking contributions from ‘corporate employees or owners.’ Lamb received some contributions from PNC employees, but would not have accepted money from their PAC (if asked)." Feldman added: "When you're accepting money from a non-corporate PAC, it comes from hundreds, often thousands, of people who are concerned about issues that affect their day-to-day lives. This is very different from accepting money from corporate PACs which have a singular agenda, the corporation’s bottom line." (Of course there is the potential for overlap between corporate interests and the interests of non-corporate PACs.) Corporate executives and employees are also capable of donating — with legal limits — to Lamb directly, which some certainly did. Bruce Ledewitz, a constitutional law professor at Duquesne University, said this is neither unusual nor improper. "The question is if a rich person gives money to Donald Trump knowing Trump favors lower taxes, is that undue influence? And I say no, it is not," Ledewitz explained. "I don’t think there’s the slightest indication that campaign contributions have any influence at all. Lobbying has influence." Mayersohn said there were also no corporate PAC expenditures on mailers or ads in support of Lamb’s candidacy. "Corporate PACs almost never make independent expenditures," he said. "Sometimes trade association or industry PACs (like the American Chemistry Council or the National Association of Realtors) make independent expenditures, but not in this race." While some argue that the shunning of corporate PACs by political candidates is largely an empty gesture, groups like End Citizens United tout the Lamb campaign’s lack of corporate PAC donors as a breath of fresh air. Lamb campaign manager Abby Murphy also said Lamb will again refuse corporate PAC money when he runs in November, this time in the what would be the new 17th Congressional District under a statewide redistricting plan. Our ruling U.S. Congressional candidate Conor Lamb said, "I'm proud that you helped me refuse corporate PAC money." FEC records do not list corporate PACs as having donated to his campaign or having directly spent money in support of his candidacy. While it’s possible corporate PAC money donated to other PACs reached him indirectly, experts say that’s not the same thing. Lamb’s claim is literally accurate, but campaign finances are complicated and voters need additional information.	None	Conor Lamb	None	None	None	2018-03-17T09:00:00	2018-03-13	['None']
pomt-04892	Says Mitt Romney did not pay taxes for 10 years.	pants on fire!	/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/aug/06/harry-reid/harry-reid-says-anonymous-source-told-him-mitt-rom/	Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., touched off a firestorm last week after he claimed that an unnamed investor in Mitt Romney’s company, Bain Capital, told him that Romney hadn’t paid any taxes for 10 years. In a July 31, 2012, interview with the Huffington Post, Reid attacked Romney for refusing to publicly release tax returns prior to 2010. Reid said, "His poor father must be so embarrassed about his son," referring to George Romney's decision to release 12 years of tax returns when he ran for president in the late 1960s. Reid told the website that about a month earlier, a person who had invested with Bain Capital called his office and said, "Harry, he didn't pay any taxes for 10 years." Reid continued, "He didn't pay taxes for 10 years! Now, do I know that that's true? Well, I'm not certain," said Reid. "But obviously he can't release those tax returns. How would it look? … You guys have said his wealth is $250 million. Not a chance in the world. It's a lot more than that. I mean, you do pretty well if you don't pay taxes for 10 years when you're making millions and millions of dollars." On Aug. 2, Reid repeated the allegation on the Senate floor, saying, "As we know, he has refused to release his tax returns. If a person coming before this body wanted to be a Cabinet officer, he couldn't be if he had the same refusal Mitt Romney does about tax returns. So the word is out that he has not paid any taxes for 10 years. Let him prove he has paid taxes, because he has not." And later that day, Reid tripled down on the accusation, releasing a statement that said in part, "I was told by an extremely credible source that Romney has not paid taxes for 10 years." Romney and his allies pushed back hard against the accusation, saying it was not only substantively incorrect but also ethically out of bounds. "Harry Reid really has to put up or shut up," Romney said following a speech in North Las Vegas, Nev., according to CBS News. Romney added, "Let me also say, categorically, I have paid taxes every year -- and a lot of taxes. So Harry is simply wrong. And that is why I am so anxious for him to give us the names of the people who put this forward. I wouldn't be at all surprised to hear the names are people from the White House or the Obama campaign." Other Republicans leaped to Romney’s defense, including Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., (who told CNN’s State of the Union that "I think he’s lying") and Republican National Committee chairman Reince Priebus, who called Reid a "dirty liar" on ABC’s This Week. Outside commentators, including liberals, have slammed Reid as well. The New York Times’ Frank Bruni called Reid’s charges part of an "unbecoming, corrosive game." "Spew first and sweat the details later, or never," Bruni wrote. "Speak loosely and carry a stick-thin collection of backup materials, or none at all. That’s the M.O. of the moment, familiar from the past but in particularly galling and profuse flower of late." Many readers asked us to put Reid’s claim to the Truth-O-Meter. We conclude that Reid, despite repeating the claim on at least two occasions, has not produced any solid evidence it is true. An anonymous source? On Aug. 6, a Reid spokesman confirmed to PolitiFact that the majority leader still maintains the information came from the anonymous Bain investor. Our Truth-O-Meter guidelines say we hold officials accountable to back up their words. By those standards, Reid has not proven his allegation. Still, we wondered how likely it was that Romney didn’t pay taxes for 10 years. In an Internal Revenue Service study of nearly 4 million 2009 tax returns of filers reporting more than $200,000 in adjusted gross income, 20,752 of these taxpayers -- or just 0.529 percent -- had no U.S. income tax liability. About half of those did have income tax liability in other countries. But Romney’s recent income has been substantially higher than $200,000, meaning that the size of his deductions and credits would need to be even larger than for many of those included in this IRS study if his tax liability was going to fall to zero. According to the one full return he’s released, for tax year 2010, he and his wife Ann reported an adjusted gross income of $21.6 million and paid taxes of about $3 million. He's also released an estimate of his 2011 taxes, which showed income of $20.9 million and a tax payment of $3.2 million. To gauge tax patterns for even higher-income earners, the best we can do is to look at another IRS study detailing the taxes paid by the top 400 earners in the nation in 2008. To make this list, you would have to have earned roughly $109 million that year. Among those 400 top taxpayers, 30 -- or 7.5 percent -- had an effective tax rate of between 0 and 10 percent. Given how the statistics are calculated, it’s impossible to know how many paid no taxes, but it’s safe to assume it’s well below 7.5 percent. Neither study directly addresses Romney’s situation -- he falls somewhere in the middle of the two studies -- but the data does show that for earners both below and above him, it's unlikely they paid zero taxes for one year, and it’s even more far-fetched to think they did so for 10 years. Salon.com -- which is generally considered a liberal media outlet, thus no friend to Romney -- asked two tax experts whether they thought it was likely that Romney paid no taxes for 10 years. They concluded, "probably not." The article quoted David Miller, a tax attorney with the firm Cadwalader, Wickersham & Taft in New York, saying it’s "highly unlikely" that he paid nothing. "It would be easier for someone like Steve Jobs to pay zero, as most of his wealth was in company stock, which isn’t taxed until sold and may never be sold," Miller told Salon. The Salon article continued, "But Romney’s arrangement with Bain is different. He would have earned management fees, and when Bain sold the underlying companies that it invested in, Romney would have been subject to tax on his share. 'It’s possible he paid very little in taxes, but I find it hard to believe that he paid none,' Miller said." Salon also quoted Joshua Kamerman, a lawyer and CPA in New York, who said while it’s theoretically possible, it’s also "preposterous." "Charitable donations can shield up to only 50 percent of tax liability, while other means can lower the rate," the article said. "But to pay nothing, Romney would have to sustain business operating losses, Kamerman said. The IRS lets people carry over losses for up to 20 years until they make a profit from which to deduct them. But Kamerman said this is almost certainly not the case for Romney." We asked Lawrence J. White, an economist at the Stern School of Business at New York University, for his view, and he concurred with Miller and Kamerman. "I agree that it's extremely unlikely that Mr. Romney paid no income taxes for 10 years," White said. Our ruling Reid has said Romney paid no taxes for 10 years. It was no slip of the tongue. He repeated the claim on at least two more occasions, at one point saying that "the word is out" when in fact it was only Reid who put that "word" out. Reid has produced no evidence to back up his claim other than attribution to a shadowy anonymous source. Romney has denied the claim, and tax experts back him up, saying that the nature of Romney's investments in Bain make it highly unlikely he would have been able to avoid paying taxes altogether -- especially for 10 years. Reid has made an extreme claim with nothing solid to back it up. Pants on Fire!	None	Harry Reid	None	None	None	2012-08-06T15:43:15	2012-07-31	['None']
pomt-04750	"A report just came out that if we continue with President Obama's policies, we're looking at over 9 percent unemployment next year in the fourth quarter."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/aug/29/michele-bachmann/rep-michele-bachmann-claims-report-says-presidents/	In a show of GOP unity for convention week, Rep. Michele Bachmann made her case on Fox News for a Mitt Romney presidency. She also got in her digs at the other guy. Under President Barack Obama, she said, you should expect unemployment to rise. "A report just came out that if we continue with President Obama's policies, we're looking at over 9 percent unemployment next year in the fourth quarter," Bachmann told host Sean Hannity in the Aug. 27, 2012, interview in Tampa. The unemployment rate was 8.3 percent in July, so that would mark a serious reversal. We decided to track down the report. The fiscal cliff The former presidential candidate from Minnesota said she was referring to a report from the Congressional Budget Office, the nonpartisan agency with expert staff that generates projections about how laws affect the federal budget and economy. We reached out to her office for more detail, but didn’t hear back. So we checked out CBO's most recent such report, an update to the country’s economic outlook for the decade. It did include a projection that unemployment could reach 9.1 percent in the fourth quarter next year (Table 2-1). But that projection was not based on continuing "President Obama’s policies." Rather, it was CBO’s look at what would happen if current laws are left unchanged -- which is not what Obama advocates. "The policies that Rep. Bachmann refers to as 'President Obama’s policies' are in fact what would result if the Congress fails to reach an agreement with the president on how to continue economic stimulus policies which he strongly favors," said Gary Burtless, an economist with the Brookings Institution. (As we've noted before, Burtless contributed $750 to Obama’s campaign in 2011. However, in 2008 he provided advice on aspects of labor policy to the presidential campaign of Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., and he has worked as a government economist and served on federal advisory panels under presidents of both parties.) If the president and Congress can’t resolve their standoff, what results is referred to alternately as the "fiscal cliff" or "taxmageddon." Congress set some of the conditions for the cliff last year in their deal to increase the debt ceiling — the Budget Control Act. It specified that if Congress couldn’t find $1.2 trillion in budget cuts, automatic cuts would hit across the board, including defense programs. (Bachmann voted against the act; she opposed raising the debt ceiling and called the deal a "temporary fix.") So right now, current law would, for instance, impose those stiff automatic spending cuts and let major tax cuts expire. (Obama would renew the tax cuts for those earning under $250,000 and doesn’t want to see automatic cuts.) The deficit would shrink an estimated $641 billion in the next fiscal year. That would most likely lead to a recession, driving down GDP and pushing up unemployment, the CBO calculated. That’s right: Bachmann’s talking about what would happen if the deficit shrinks. It’s worth noting Obama plays a role in the standoff, even if he doesn’t endorse its result. "He could be blamed, of course, for refusing to negotiate unless Republicans raise taxes, thereby making the cliff more likely," said Michael Tanner, a senior fellow at the libertarian Cato Institute. "I suppose the flip side applies as well, though." If lawmakers and the president work out a deal that keeps the tax cuts and avoids automatic spending cuts, among other things, CBO calculates that the unemployment rate will drop to 8 percent (Table 2-2) — not rise. Neither of those scenarios perfectly reflects Obama’s policy goals. But the second one, with its unemployment rate drop, is closest. Our ruling Bachmann said, "a report just came out that if we continue with President Obama's policies, we're looking at over 9 percent unemployment next year in the fourth quarter." But that jobless rate is based a projection of "current law," which would only happen as a result of a standoff between Congress and the president, not Obama’s own policy priorities. Unemployment would rise in the face of immediate deficit reduction — something that more closely resembles Bachmann’s preference than the president’s. The 9 percent unemployment figure is mentioned in the CBO study, but it is inaccurate for Bachmann to say it is under Obama's policies. We rate the claim False.

pomt-00671	"Two-thirds of American families rely on the mother's income to stay above the poverty level."	mostly false	/punditfact/statements/2015/may/11/maria-shriver/maria-shriver-2-american-families-rely-mothers-inc/	What better way to honor moms on Mother’s Day than to mark how much they do to keep the country on even keel. On Meet the Press, NBC correspondent Maria Shriver tried to underscore the pivotal economic role mothers play. "Two-thirds of American families rely on the mother's income to stay above the poverty level," Shriver told host Chuck Todd, as a graphic highlighted the same message. That’s a powerful message -- that two in three American families would fall below the federal poverty line if it weren't for Mom. Unfortunately, it’s incorrect. Shriver botched the wording of a different stat from the Shriver Report, a regular publication focused largely on the status of women. For the 2014 edition, Shriver partnered with the liberal Center for American Progress. That report claimed that "In an era when women have solidified their position as half of the U.S. workforce and a whopping two-thirds of the primary or co-breadwinners in American families, the reality is that a third of all American women are living at or near a space we call ‘the brink of poverty.’ " That passage may sound like it supports Shriver’s point. But it doesn’t. So what's the real number? We asked Philip Cohen, who researches inequality and families at the University of Maryland, to see if he could find the actual percentage of families who rely on a mother’s income to stay above the poverty level. Using Census Bureau data from the March 2014 Current Population Survey and comparing it to poverty threshold statistics, Cohen identified 33.6 million U.S. families that included at least one child and a mother. In 6.7 million of those households, the mother’s income was vital in the way Shriver stated. That’s a shade under 20 percent -- far from two in three. "You could say 20 percent of families with mothers and children rely on the mother’s income to remain above the poverty line," Cohen said. "The rest either were poor already, 16 percent, or still wouldn’t be poor even without the mother’s income, 64 percent, because of income from the father or other family members." Cohen tried a slightly different approach and started just with the families that were not in poverty, which created a pool of 28.2 million households. That would boost the percentage of families who rely on a mother’s income to stay out of poverty to about 24 percent. "I don’t see how you can get to 67 percent, or two-thirds, as Shriver said," Cohen told us. Cohen agreed with Shriver’s main point -- that mothers in many families make a huge difference in the family’s standard of living -- but said she got the specific statistic wrong. After contacting Shriver, she tweeted a correction. Shriver wrote, "Clarifying what I said on @meetthepress: 2/3 of U.S. families rely on a mother's income that keeps many families out of poverty, but not all." Our ruling Shriver said that for two-thirds of families with children, the mother’s income keeps them out of poverty. According to an analysis of Census Bureau data, the actual figure is closer to one-fourth. The mother’s income matters, but not to the extent she said. An expert said there was a grain of truth to Shriver’s claim -- a mother’s income makes a big difference in a family’s standard of living -- but not at the percentage Shriver said.

pomt-08713	Ron Johnson is "willing to hand over the Great Lakes to the oil companies."	mostly false	/wisconsin/statements/2010/sep/03/russ-feingold/russ-feingold-says-ron-johnson-willing-hand-over-g/	As in the Gulf of Mexico, oil just won’t disappear from the U.S. Senate race in Wisconsin. It’s a central part of an ad by U.S. Sen. Russ Feingold, a Democrat locked in a tough re-election battle. Not only does the ad argue that Republican Ron Johnson wants to drill for oil in the Great Lakes, it says he’s "willing to hand over the Great Lakes to the oil companies." For lake-loving Wisconsinites, the issue hits home. The charge goes back to a statement that bubbled up when Johnson sat down for a wide-ranging interview with Wispolitics.com. Johnson, an Oshkosh businessman, was asked this question: "Would you support more drilling in the U.S., continental, Great Lakes for example, if there was oil found there, and more exploration in Alaska, those kind of things?" Johnson’s answer: "The bottom line is, we are an oil based economy and there’s nothing we’re going to do to get off of that for many, many years. So we have to be realistic and recognize that fact. We have to get the oil where it is, but we need to do it responsibly, we need to utilize American ingenuity and American technology to make sure we to do it environmentally sensitively and safely." That’s where it began. This is where it wound up: The Feingold campaign issued a news release June 18 that said, "when asked if he would support drilling in the Great Lakes, Johnson said: ‘I think we have to get the oil where it is.’ " The release prompted some chatter in the blogosphere, though the issue remained low on the public radar screen. And the Johnson campaign remained silent. Then came Feingold’s TV ad. It showed a map of the United States and graphically transplanted the BP oil spill from the Gulf of Mexico to Lake Michigan shores. Meanwhile, Feingold is heard saying Johnson is "willing to hand over the Great Lakes to the oil companies, threatening Wisconsin’s economy and a way of life for generations of Wisconsin families." To hear Feingold, one would think BP was ready to plop an oil rig just off the Summerfest grounds. So, we figured it was time for us to do a little drilling of our own to see if Feingold hit the mark. There is little doubt Johnson, a BP shareholder, has a "Drill, baby, drill" attitude. On Oct. 10, 2009 -- before he was a candidate -- Johnson told a tea party gathering in Oshkosh: "I want oil companies to make enough money to continue to explore, drill, refine, and deliver gas to virtually every corner of America." That would presumably include the Great Lakes. But Johnson’s campaign issued a statement July 12, four weeks after the Wispolitics.com interview, that left no wiggle room. It said: "I would reject any and all efforts to drill in the Great Lakes." That statement was issued at 3:49 p.m., the day before the Feingold ad was launched. John Kraus, senior strategist for Feingold’s campaign, said the Johnson statement was issued about an hour after the Feingold campaign made its TV buy. Coincidence, or was Johnson tipped off about the Feingold ad? You decide. Johnson quickly launched his own response ad, which said in part: "Ron Johnson opposes drilling in the Great Lakes and Russ Feingold knows it." And Johnson and his campaign later argued there’s not enough oil in the lake to make drilling worthwhile and that it was too cold to do much drilling here anyway. Finally, six weeks after his initial response Johnson said he may have not heard "Great Lakes" included in the question. In other words, it’s kind of a gooey mess. Let’s clean it all up. Feingold took an off-the-cuff statement by Johnson -- albeit one Johnson had a month to correct -- and made it the centerpiece of a TV ad that launched the day after Johnson had re-framed his views. Johnson has noted his support for more oil exploration. But the ad made a flat hand-the-lakes-over statement, ignoring Johnson’s expressed concerns for the environment. That’s not handing the lakes over to Big Oil. It was produced based on the original Johnson statement, but the ad remained on the air long after Johnson clearly said no to Great Lakes drilling. And Feingold is continuing to state on the campaign trail: "It’s kind of reasonable to think that if (Johnson) had a chance to vote for drilling the Great Lakes, he’d be first in line." We rate Feingold’s claim Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.

pomt-10016	"We had bipartisan legislation that got through the Senate" that would have prevented bonuses like AIG's "and then somehow mysteriously disappeared."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/mar/18/ron-wyden/aig-bonus-wyden-snowe/	As public outrage builds over bonuses issued by bailout recipient AIG, two senators are claiming they tried to outlaw such bonuses but were thwarted by the White House and fellow lawmakers. Sen. Ron Wyden, Democrat of Oregon, and Sen. Olympia Snowe, Republican of Maine, say they proposed an amendment to the stimulus bill in February that would have imposed heavy penalties on bailout recipients that refused to pay back bonuses over $100,000. Wyden made the claim during an appearance on The Rachel Maddow Show on MSNBC, and in other interviews. "Back in early February, you and Senator Snowe added an amendment to the stimulus bill that, I think, would have prevented AIG from giving out these millions of dollars worth of bonuses," Maddow said to Wyden. "That amendment was taken out of the bill. Am I right that your amendment would have stopped what we are experiencing right now?" "You are right," Wyden said. "And that's what's so sad about this situation. It simply didn't need to happen." Wyden went on to predict that a similar measure would pass now that the issue has gained so much public attention. "I think finally, we'll get it done," he said. "The tragedy is it should have been done a month ago when we had bipartisan legislation that got through the Senate and then somehow mysteriously disappeared." In a separate interview with the Huffington Post, Wyden blamed both the White House and fellow legislators, suggesting they caved to lobbyists for Wall Street who opposed the measure. Wyden and Snowe announced the amendment Feb. 4, proposing it be tacked onto another amendment to the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, otherwise known as the stimulus bill. Last year's financial rescue package, commonly known as the bailout, had "left open the escape hatch of golden parachutes for top executives on Wall Street," Snowe, a member of the Senate Finance Committee, said at the time. "This amendment insists on strong taxpayer protections and guarantees that no tax dollars be used to prop up Wall Street executives." The amendment required companies that received government rescue funds in 2008 to repay within four months any bonuses above $100,000 or face an excise tax of 35 percent on the portion of the bonus over $100,000. It reportedly would have raised as much as $3.2 billion, a substantial chunk of the $18.4 billion in employee bonuses paid out in 2008 by companies that received more than $274 billion of bailout funds. Wyden pressed Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner on the amendment at a Senate Budget Committee hearing on Feb. 11. "Given the fact that the president, to his credit, called these bonuses shameful, and time is short, where do you stand on getting a solution to the problem of these just-paid excessive bonuses in the economic stimulus legislation?" Wyden asked. "We've talked about that privately," Geithner said, in part, in a lengthy response. "Our staffs are working together. We'd like to work with you on how to achieve that objective." American Banker , a trade publication, reported on Feb. 12 that the banking industry "strongly opposes" the provision, "which the banking industry hopes to scale back when the House and Senate hash out differences between the stimulus bills." They appear to have succeeded. On Feb. 12, the Associated Press reported: "The provision was removed as House and Senate negotiators hammered out final details of the $789 billion economic stimulus legislation this week." There is no documentation in the public record of exactly who removed the provision. Wyden overstated the case a bit when he responded in the affirmative to Maddow's suggestion that the amendment "would have stopped what we are experiencing right now." It would not have eliminated the bonuses entirely — only that portion over $100,000 per person. And the tax that would have been imposed on companies that did not comply would have recovered just 35 percent of the excessive amount. But Wyden can legitimately claim to have taken on the issue with gusto — well before the current outrage over AIG's bonuses. We find his claim to be Mostly True.

pomt-02398	Says President Barack Obama "is the first president we've ever had who thinks he can choose which laws to enforce and which laws to ignore."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2014/mar/10/ted-cruz/ted-cruz-says-barack-obama-first-president-who-thi/	Critics of President Barack Obama have charged that he has regularly exceeded the powers of his office in selectively enforcing the law. Their examples include making recess appointments, issuing executive orders, delaying provisions of his health care law, refusing to defend the Defense of Marriage Act in court and declining to deport certain categories of young illegal immigrants. At the 2014 CPAC conference, Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, reiterated this point to the audience of conservative activists. Referring to Obama, Cruz said, "This president of the United States is the first president we've ever had who thinks he can choose which laws to enforce and which laws to ignore." We were suspicious of this claim, because we recalled several instances in recent years of other presidents being accused of exceeding their executive authority. We checked with eight historians and legal scholars across the ideological spectrum to see whether they could point to prior examples of presidents choosing to ignore laws. They came up with a number of examples. (Cruz’s office did not return an inquiry for this story.) While Ilya Shapiro, a senior fellow in constitutional studies at the libertarian Cato Institute, said he believes Obama is "setting records for the number, scope, and creativity of unconstitutional and illegal behavior," he acknowledged that "Obama wasn't the first president to violate the law and won't be the last." Here’s a trip down memory lane to review just some of the instances in which presidents are believed to have acted in ways that ignored existing legal or constitutional limits: • Abraham Lincoln. During the Civil War era, Lincoln "broke an assortment of laws and ignored one constitutional provision after another," according to an analysis by the Miller Center at the University of Virginia. Lincoln waged war without a congressional declaration of war (or even a Congress in session to declare one), spent $2 million to raise an army without congressional appropriation, suspended the writ of habeas corpus, and issued the Emancipation Proclamation, among other actions. "Following a strategy of ‘unilateral action,’ Lincoln justified his powers as an emergency authority granted to him by the people," the Miller Center analysis concludes. "He had been elected, he told his critics, to decide when an emergency existed and to take all measures required to deal with it. In doing so, Lincoln maintained that the President was one of three ‘coordinate’ departments of government, not in any way subordinate to Congress or the courts." • Andrew Johnson. After the Civil War ended and Lincoln was assassinated, Andrew Johnson became president and almost immediately clashed with Congress over how to treat the former Confederacy. Edwin M. Stanton, who had been Secretary of War under Lincoln, retained his position under Johnson and became one of the new president’s biggest critics, asserting that the federal government should intervene more forcefully to protect freed slaves’ rights in the South. In 1867, Congress passed the Tenure of Office Act, which required Senate approval before a president fired federal officials who had originally been confirmed by the Senate. When Johnson tried to oust Stanton, the Senate blocked him; when Johnson made a second ouster attempt, the House impeached him. (Johnson ultimately survived impeachment, Stanton resigned, and the Tenure of Office Act was repealed in 1887.) • Franklin Delano Roosevelt. On March 11, 1941, as World War II was already under way in Europe -- and while the United States was still officially on the sidelines -- Roosevelt signed a landmark law known as the Lend-Lease Act. At the time, Britain was under siege and almost out of money, so the law authorized the president to sell, lease, or lend military hardware to any country he designated as vital to American national security. However, a provision in the law would have allowed Congress to terminate the president’s powers after a certain amount of time through a "concurrent resolution." This amounted to a "legislative veto" by a simple majority and without the president’s signature. Roosevelt believed this to be unconstitutional, but he signed the bill anyway, secretly writing a memorandum to Attorney General Robert H. Jackson explaining that "the emergency was so great that I signed the bill in spite of a clearly unconstitutional provision contained in it." Jackson only made the episode public in 1953. • Harry Truman. In the midst of the Korean War, Truman had to grapple with labor disputes within the steel industry -- a sector he considered vital to the war effort. In a bid to head off a looming work stoppage, Truman in 1952 ordered his Commerce Secretary to seize the steel mills. The industry objected, and Truman’s seizure was ultimately ruled unconstitutional by the Supreme Court in the case Youngstown Sheet & Tube Co. v. Sawyer. • Richard Nixon. Citing government spending as a reason for surging inflation, Nixon refused to spend nearly $12 billion of congressionally appropriated funds for 1973 and 1974. He did so under an executive action known as "impoundment" -- an action that had been used by many presidents previously, but with questionable constitutionality. Faced with Nixon’s unusually large impoundment -- and with the president bogged down in Watergate -- Congress rebelled, passing legislation to make impoundment illegal. Nixon vetoed the bill, Congress overrode his veto, and Nixon stood his ground. The administration challenged the new law barring impoundment, but a federal court sided with Congress, saying impoundment was unconstitutional. • Ronald Reagan. Reagan’s quest to fight communism suffered a setback in the middle of his first term when the Democratic Congress in 1983 passed the Boland Amendment, which restricted the CIA and the Defense Department from operating in Nicaragua. An even stronger version passed the following year. The Reagan administration diverted some of the proceeds of a secret arms sale to Iran to the anti-communist militia in Nicaragua known as the Contras, an action that directly violated the Boland Amendment. Several top advisers to Reagan were implicated in what became known as the Iran-Contra affair. While the Reagan-appointed Tower Commission said Reagan's disengagement from White House management had made the diversion possible, Reagan himself was never formally linked to the violation of the Boland amendment. • George W. Bush. While president, Bush issued 161 signing statements -- that is, official pronouncements that accompany the signing of a bill into law. In addition to commenting on the law generally, signing statements have been used to document the president’s constitutional objections to provisions contained in the law, and sometimes to announce how (or whether) parts of the law will be enforced. Bush was hardly the first to issue signing statements, but he was the most prolific. According to the Congressional Research Service, Bush issued 161 signing statements, which is a smaller number than each of his three immediate predecessors. But 79 percent of Bush’s statements -- a much higher rate -- noted a challenge or objection to the law being signed, rather than offering relatively innocuous comments. Meanwhile, many statements contained multiple reservations, making the total number more than 1,000. The American Bar Association published a report asserting that Bush’s statements were "contrary to the rule of law and our constitutional separation of powers" when they "claim the authority or state the intention to disregard or decline to enforce all or part of a law ... or to interpret such a law in a manner inconsistent with the clear intent of Congress." Like Lincoln and Franklin Roosevelt before him, Bush "asserted the power to violate certain laws if necessary to defend the country," said Kermit Roosevelt, a University of Pennsylvania law professor. "Bush’s signing statements typically said that he would interpret laws restricting executive authority, such as a law forbidding cruel and inhumane treatment of detainees, in a manner consistent with his understanding of his power as commander-in-chief. What that meant, it turned out when the memos were declassified, was that the law did not bind him if he believed certain actions were necessary to national security — the ‘commander-in-chief override.’ " Our ruling We found that at least seven presidents -- including some of the nation’s most admired occupants of the White House -- acted, at least on occasion, in ways that ignored specific laws or constitutional protections. It is not accurate to say, as Cruz does, that Obama would be "the first president we've ever had who thinks he can choose which laws to enforce and which laws to ignore." Presidents have done so frequently, and historians expect that they will continue to do so. We rate the claim False. *** EDITOR’S NOTE, March 11, 2014: After we published our story, Cruz’s office provided the following response: "Since the dawn of the republic, the president and Congress have resisted attempts from each other to encroach upon their constitutional powers. Many presidents have asserted, and have abused, executive authority. No one is arguing that President Obama is the first to make this mistake. As Sen. Cruz has detailed in three reports, a Wall Street Journal op-ed, and a brief before the U.S. Supreme Court, no president until President Obama has ever claimed the authority to ignore the explicit text of statutes passed by Congress and unilaterally replace that text with whatever the president wishes. From Obamacare to immigration, to same sex marriage, to marijuana laws, President Obama’s willingness to ignore or alter law is unquestionably outside the scope of executive power. It amounts to legislating, pure and simple." However, we don’t agree that there’s a significant distinction between "abus(ing) executive authority" and a "willingness to ignore or alter law," so we feel comfortable with the historical examples we used to analyze Cruz’s statement. We’re standing by our original ruling of False.	None	Ted Cruz	None	None	None	2014-03-10T17:00:33	2014-03-06	['None']
pomt-14187	"Before taking executive action on immigration, President Obama stated 22 times that he does not have the authority to change immigration laws on his own."	mostly true	/virginia/statements/2016/apr/25/bob-goodlatte/goodlatte-obama-said-22-times-he-lacks-power-chang/	U.S. Rep. Bob Goodlatte says it should be a no-brainer for the U.S. Supreme Court to strike down President Barack Obama’s stalled program to shield millions of immigrants from deportation and allow them to work in the country legally. The high court heard arguments April 19 on whether Obama exceeded his authority in late 2014 by going around Congress and launching the program via executive order. Goodlatte, in a statement issued the day of the hearing, said the court should be guided by the past words of the president himself. "Before taking executive action on immigration, President Obama stated 22 times that he does not have the authority to change immigration laws on his own," said Goodlatte, R-6th. Obama’s program would delay deportation of immigrants who have lived illegally in the U.S. for more than five years but have children who are citizens or have green cards. If applicants pass background checks and pay a fee, they could qualify for a work permit and avoid deportation for at least three years. More than 4 million people could qualify for the program. The president announced the program Nov. 20, 2014, after House Republicans didn’t act on a comprehensive immigration reform bill. Twenty-six states, not including Virginia, have sued to stop the program and have won before a federal district court judge in Texas and the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. We decided to examine Goodlatte’s claim that Obama said 22 times that he lacked the power to change immigration laws by himself. It’s a claim that’s been made by many Republicans. The source, according to Goodlatte’s statement, is a list blogged on Nov. 19, 2014, by then-House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio. Let’s first discuss the problems with Boehner’s list. Four of the quotes Boehner cited do not mention immigration but were general statements Obama made as a candidate for president about limiting the use of executive orders - a power he accused his predecessor, Republican George W. Bush, of abusing. In another quote flagged by Boehner, Obama actually was talking about his inability to end the military’s now-defunct "don’t ask, don’t tell" policies on homosexuality. That leaves, by our count, 17 Obama statements on the list that go to the heart of Goodlatte’s claim. Here’s a sampling: March 28, 2011 During a town hall meeting at Bell Multicultural High School in the District of Columbia, Obama was asked if he could issue an executive order to stop deportation of undocumented high school students. The president dismissed the idea. Obama said, "With respect to the notion that I can just suspend deportations through executive orders, that’s just not the case, because there are laws on the books that Congress has passed - and I know that everybody here at Bell is studying hard, so you know that we’ve got three branches of government. Congress passes the law. The executive branch’s job is to enforce and implement those laws. And then the judiciary has to interpret the laws. "There are enough laws on the books that are very clear in terms of how we enforce our immigration system that for me to, simply through executive order, ignore these constitutional mandates would not conform with my appropriate role as president. That does not mean, though, that we can’t make decisions, for example, to emphasize enforcement on those who’ve engaged in criminal activity." Jan. 30, 2013 During an interview with Univision, a Spanish-language television network, Obama was asked if he would consider a moratorium on deportations of non-criminal immigrants. The president said, "Well, I think it is important to remind everybody that, as I said, I think, previously, I’m not a king. I am the head of the executive branch of government. I’m required to follow the law. And that’s what we’ve done. But what I’ve also said is, let’s make sure that we’re applying the law in a way that takes into account people’s humanity. That’s the reason that we’ve moved forward on deferred action. Within the confines of the law, we said we have some discretion in terms of how we apply this law. The same is true with respect to the kinds of the length of time that people have to spend outside of the country when their spouses are already here, for example." Feb. 14, 2013 Obama was asked during a Google+ Hangout, by a woman named Jackie, if he would be willing to take executive action on immigration to ensure "families are not split apart." Obama said, "Well look Jackie, this is something I’ve struggled with throughout my presidency. The problem is that I’m the president of the United States. I’m not the emperor of the United States. My job is to execute laws that are passed, and Congress, right now, has not changed what I consider to be a broken immigration system, and what that means is we have certain obligations to enforce the laws that are in place, even if we think in many cases the results may be tragic. "And what we have been able to do is to make sure that we are focusing our enforcement resources on criminals as opposed to someone who is just here and trying to work and look after their families. What we have tried to do is administratively reduce the burdens and hardships on families being separated, and what we’ve done is obviously passed a deferred action which made sure the dreamers - young people who were brought here and think of themselves as American are American, except for their papers - that they are not deported. Having said all that, we’ve kind of stretched our administrative flexibility as much as we can. That’s why making sure we get comprehensive immigration reform done is so important." Sept. 17, 2013 Obama was interviewed by Jose Diaz-Balart, anchor for Noticias Telemundo. The broadcaster asked the president if he would "consider unilaterally freezing deportations for the parents of deferred-action kids" - a term that generally refers to people who came to the U.S. when they were younger than 16, attend school or have graduated, and have not committed criminal offenses. Obama said, "Here’s the problem that I have, Jose, and I’ve said this consistently. My job in the executive branch is supposed to be to carry out the laws that are passed. Congress has said, ‘Here’s the law when it comes to those who are undocumented,’ and they allocate a whole bunch of money for enforcement, and what I have been able to do is make a legal argument, that I think is absolutely right, that given the resources that we have, we can’t do everything that Congress has asked us to do. "What we can do is then carve out the DREAM Act folks, saying young people who have basically grown up here are Americans that we should welcome. We’re not going to have them grow up under a cloud, under a shadow. But if we start broadening that, then essentially I would be ignoring the law in a way that I feel would be very difficult to defend legally." On Nov. 18, 2014 - two days before Obama announced his immigration program - White House spokesman Josh Earnest said the president altered his view on his executive power after conferring with the attorney general and the secretary of homeland security on "what, if any, authority he could use to try to fix some of the problems that House Republicans have refused to address." The White House argued before the Supreme Court that the 26 states contesting Obama’s program have no legal standing to sue, because immigration policy is the domain of the federal government and that no laws have been broken. The Obama administration also argued that it merely is setting policies - not establishing laws - on whom to deport. Congress, it said, provides only enough money annually to deport about 400,000 of the nation’s estimated 11 million undocumented immigrants. The White House says it has focused on using those funds to deport those with criminal violations. Our ruling Goodlatte said, "Before taking executive action on immigration, President Obama stated 22 times that he does not have the authority to change immigration laws on his own." Records offered by Goodlatte and other Republicans show Obama repeatedly has made such statements. But the congressman goes a little off course in trying to quantify the times the president has said so. In a handful of the instances, the president was talking in general terms about executive authority that he did not relate to immigration. So in the interest of precision, we rate Goodlatte’s claim Mostly True.	None	Bob Goodlatte	None	None	None	2016-04-25T08:00:00	2016-04-18	['Barack_Obama']

pomt-03482	Says Texas law requires state agencies to give preference to goods produced and grown in Texas.	true	/texas/statements/2013/jun/12/rick-perry/rick-perry-says-law-requires-state-agencies-give-p/	In vetoing House Bill 535, a measure dealing with how state agencies select and buy goods, Gov. Rick Perry said, "Current law already requires state agencies to give preference to goods produced and grown in Texas." Perry said in a press release May 25, 2013, the day of the veto, that "HB 535 requires state agencies, when purchasing goods, to give preference to goods ‘manufactured’ in Texas. … This bill simply does not change current law." Soon after, a reader emailed us to ask: "Is this truly in current law"? The law that the bill would have modified is in Section 2155.444 of the state's Government Code, which says that when "making purchases of goods, including agricultural products," the comptroller and state agencies "shall give preference to those produced or grown in this state or offered by Texas bidders." Next, the law says, goods from elsewhere in the United States must be considered. State law has contained Texas-first purchasing preferences for more than 50 years. According to a May 4, 1981, state attorney general opinion, the Legislature created "Texas preferences" with a 1957 law which replaced an older statute favoring "bidders who have an established local business." The 1957 law, according to the opinion, "created a preference for products produced in Texas as well as one for products offered by Texas citizens." HB 535, as filed Jan. 15, 2013, by Rep. Yvonne Davis, D-Dallas, added "manufactured" to "produced or grown" and included a definition: "‘Manufactured’ means, with respect to assembled goods, the final assembly, processing, packaging, testing, or other process that adds value, quality, or reliability." It added a requirement that the state comptroller shall "promote the purchase of" such Texas-grown or otherwise Texas-created goods. In the legislation’s final version, that definition encompassed items "produced as a result of a manufacturing process that alters the form or function of components" in a way that adds value and transforms the parts into something different from what simply assembling the parts would have produced. Both versions also added a requirement that the state comptroller and state agencies "promote the purchase of" Texas goods. Ed Sills, spokesman for the Texas AFL-CIO labor federation, which supported the vetoed proposal, told us by phone that the combined effect of requiring such promotion, emphasizing manufactured goods and encouraging agencies to "buy Texan, buy American" could have been powerful. "Current law does have preferences. It doesn’t have as robust a preference as it would have if this bill had passed," Sills said. A spokesman for the state comptroller’s office -- which counsels state agencies on purchasing -- said by email that the state interprets the current law to cover goods manufactured in Texas. R.J. DeSilva said, "Texas agencies have always considered the term ‘produced’ to include manufactured goods. Therefore, the preference for manufactured goods was already being provided." DeSilva sent us a link to comptroller procurement rules in the Texas Administrative Code stating, "Supplies, materials, and equipment are considered to be produced in Texas if they are manufactured in Texas; ‘manufactured’ does not include the work of packaging or repackaging." Our ruling Perry said, "Current law already requires state agencies to give preference to goods produced and grown in Texas." That holds up. Existing law says that when making purchases of goods, the comptroller and state agencies "shall give preference to those produced or grown in this state or offered by Texas bidders." And the comptroller operates under rules that say items "manufactured" in Texas are considered to be "produced" in Texas. We rate Perry’s statement as True.

pomt-07770	Says that in some Texas communities, "our unemployment rate is still at 10 and 20 percent."	half-true	/texas/statements/2011/feb/23/garnet-coleman/garnet-coleman-says-unemployment-still-10-and-20-p/	While the Texas unemployment rate trails the national one, that doesn’t mean every part of the state is faring well, says Democratic state Rep. Garnet Coleman of Houston. In a Dallas Morning News article posted online Feb. 15, Coleman praises the state’s unemployment rate, which as of December ran about a percentage point less than the national average. But, he adds, "in some (Texas) communities, our unemployment rate is still at 10 and 20 percent. It depends on where you’re sitting and standing in Texas as to what your quality of life is." The quotation was removed when we later reviewed the article, though the original remained intact in a Coleman blog post. Get outta here--jobless rates of 10 and 20 percent in Gawd-Blessed Texas? After leaving a message for Coleman, we fetched the latest jobless statistics from the Texas Workforce Commission’s website. For December, the Texas rate was 8 percent, the national rate 9.1 percent. That’s seasonally unadjusted, meaning it doesn’t take into account perennial changes such as those associated with teaching school or working during holiday shopping seasons. A commission chart shows that the December rates for approximately 25 metropolitan statistical areas ranged from 4.9 percent in the Midland area to 12.1 percent in McAllen-Edinburg-Mission. Three other areas had jobless rates of 10 percent or more: El Paso (10 percent), Beaumont-Port Arthur (11 percent) and Brownsville-Harlingen (11 percent). At our request, TWC spokeswoman Lisa Givens isolated Texas cities with December unemployment rates of 10 percent or more. The city with the highest rate was Port Arthur, 16.8 percent, followed by Eagle Pass, 14.3 percent; San Juan, 13 percent; Baytown, 12.6 percent; Brownsville, 12.3 percent; Weslaco, 12.3 percent; Texas City, 11.3 percent; Socorro, 11.2 percent; Pharr, 10.9 percent; Lancaster, 10.6 percent; Pasadena, 10.5 percent; San Benito, 10.4 percent and Paris, 10.2 percent. Beaumont and La Porte had rates that we rounded up to 10 percent. Drawing from commission data, we sorted city-by-city unemployment data and identified several additional cities that for at least one month in 2010 experienced an unemployment rate of 10 percent or more: Beaumont, Corsicana, Mission, La Porte and Duncanville. By e-mail, Givens told us that since 2007, no Texas county has had an average annual unemployment rate greater than 18 percent, though monthly rates occasionally exceeded that. She sent a spreadsheet for 2007 through 2010 showing unemployment peaking at 20.4 percent in Starr County in January 2010. Presidio County experienced 18 percent unemployment for most of 2010, while Zavala County reached 18.7 percent unemployment in August.. Over all, 29 of the state’s 254 counties had average 2010 unemployment rates of 10 percent or more, according to the commission. Coleman’s office, responding to our inquiry, pointed to online descriptions of seven towns, with July 2007 populations ranging from 305 to 1,053, which had unemployment rates exceeding 20 percent for adults 25 or older, according to entries posted at city-date.com, which describes itself as a multi-faceted collector of information on cities. The entries do not say where the unemployment information originated or the time period the rates cover, though Cheryl Abbot, an economist with the federal Bureau of Labor Statistics, told us it appears the figures originated in the 2000 U.S. census. The towns, in Hidalgo or Starr counties near the Texas-Mexico border, are Granjeno (20.9 percent); Faysville (23.3 percent); Los Ebanos (27.6 percent); Los Villareales (28.5 percent); Alto Bonito (29.2 percent); Havana (29.3 percent); and Salineno (31.3 percent). Joseph Madden, Coleman’s chief of staff, also noted information posted on the Texas Secretary of State’s website attributed to a publication by the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas. We found the "thumbnail" report on the reserve’s website; it says the unemployment rate in colonias -- defined by the Texas Secretary of State as border communities near Mexico that "may lack basic living necessities, such as potable water and sewer systems, electricity, paved roads, and safe and sanitary housing" -- can be more than eight times the state rate. Similarly, Madden said, a web post by the Texas Politics Project at the University of Texas says most studies agree that colonia unemployment sometimes reaches five or six times the state average. Jim Henson, who directs the project, told us the material was written by Henry Dietz, a UT Distinguished Teaching Professor of Government, in 2009. Next, Coleman’s office shared information from the TWC indicating that in December, 29 of the state’s 254 counties had unemployment rates of 10 percent or more, topped by the 18.7 percent rate in Starr County. We confirmed that count in our own online search, also identifying six other counties with rates that rounded up to 10 percent. Our takeaway: 14 percent of Texas counties had unemployment rates of nearly 10 to nearly 19 percent in December and more than a dozen cities had rates from nearly 10 to nearly 17 percent. In an interview, Coleman said that when he made his statement he meant to say Texas still has places with unemployment rates of 10 to 20 percent--not 10 and 20 percent. "If I had meant counties, I would have said counties. If I had meant cities, I would have said particular cities," Coleman said. "Some communities, some pockets, are experiencing high unemployment." All told, parts of Texas experienced jobless rates of 10 percent or more in December, including one county where unemployment approached 19 percent. We didn’t confirm any with 20 percent unemployment. Coleman’s statement is solid at the low end, teetery at the top. We rate it Half True.

pomt-01906	"Gov. Deal has the worst record on education in the history of this state."	pants on fire!	/georgia/statements/2014/jul/02/matt-mcgrath/carter-camps-claim-all-smoke/	The war of words in the governor’s race has been escalating. And it recently came to this: "Gov. Deal has the worst record on education in the history of this state," Matt McGrath, the campaign manager for Carter for Governor, said in a press release June 18. A fundraising email went out the next day, repeating that statement. In previous fact checks, we’ve noted the pitfalls to calling anything the most extreme, the first or, in this case, "the worst." The main problem: How do you prove that? In this case, Republican Nathan Deal, who faces Democrat state Sen. Jason Carter of Atlanta in the November general election, is Georgia’s 82nd governor. So when you talk about the worst governor in Georgia history, you are covering a lot of territory. Remember, the state began as a prison colony, and its first chief executive took office in 1775. The governors who followed presided over a state that made almost no attempt to educate poor whites, banned education for enslaved blacks, and aided and abetted the removal of Native American children and their parents to reservations in the West. Charles Bullock, a political science professor at the University of Georgia and a longtime Capitol observer, said the statement by McGrath is "the kind of campaign rhetoric that is false on its face." "Obviously, someone like Gene Talmadge who did three terms as governor did less for education than Nathan Deal," Bullock said. "It used to be that the state’s budget went disproportionately for transportation; now most of it goes for education." Deal took office in early 2011 and, with his budget proposal for fiscal 2015, will have increased k-12 spending by $868.6 million in four year, we reported in a recent fact check The overall budget for education is up $930 million in Deal’s tenure, when increases for pre-kindergarten and higher education are counted, according to the state Budget Office. So what about the Carter camp’s claim? We contacted Bryan Thomas, Carter’s campaign spokesman, to ask for supporting evidence. He told us the statement reflects the Carter campaign’s "opinion." He also said McGrath’s statement was aimed at Deal’s record on education funding, though that’s not what it says. Thomas made three points to us, all dealing with the austerity cuts to education that started under Gov. Sonny Perdue in 2003, increased to more than $1 billion a year in his final two years in office and have largely continued at that level under Deal. These cuts reflect the difference in what school systems qualify for and actually receive from the state under the education funding formula, the Quality Basic Education Act of 1985. Here are Thomas’ points, as well as some state data and our research.. 1). On average, Deal has underfunded k-12 education in Georgia by more than $1 billion per year since taking office. That’s true. Austerity cuts (and we’re rounding) were $1.15 billion in fiscal 2012, $1.14 billion in fiscal 2013, $1.06 billion in fiscal 2014 and $746.6 million for fiscal 2015, which began Tuesday, state records show. 2.). After just four years in office, Deal is responsible for more than half of the total austerity cuts, or about $4.1 billion. Our research and state records show the austerity cuts total about $4.1 billion under Deal and $8.4 billion since the cuts started in 2003. 3). Between fiscal 2003 (when "austerity cuts" began) and fiscal 2011 (when Deal took office) — a period encompassing the worst years of the Great Recession — the average QBE shortfall was just $380 million per year. Nathan Deal’s average has been more than 250 percent higher than that, at just over $1 billion per year. True. Austerity cuts in Deal’s tenure are averaging $1.02 billion a year. The cuts under Perdue were $134.9 million in fiscal 2003, $283.5 million in fiscal 2004, $332.8 million in fiscal 2005, $332.8 in fiscal 2006, $169.7 million in fiscal 2007, $143 million in 2008, $496 million in 2009, $1.4 billion in 2010 and $1.1 billion in 2011, with rounding. "Find me another governor who has so incredibly underfunded education according to the state’s own guidelines," Thomas said in an email. Jen Talaber, a spokeswoman for the Deal campaign, said: "To be clear, the Carter campaign just said that Governor Deal had the ‘worst record in the history of the state’?" "The Carter campaign believes that segregationist governors had better records than Governor Deal?" Talaber said it’s important to recognize the economic conditions that existed when Deal took office. "The rainy day fund was in pitiful shape, mandated health care spending was increasing, and we were in the midst of the Great Recession," she said. "In spite of that, the governor increased education funding every year he’s been in office." Carter voted for Deal’s budget every year, except for the fiscal 2015 budget this year, Talaber said. (This is something Deal’s campaign ads point out.) Talaber said the governor "believes a strong education builds a strong economy" and has backed school choice, working for passage of the 2012 charter school amendment. His record on education also includes championing or implementing a plan to increase schools’ access to the Internet, educator training in reading and other best practices, and the health education program SHAPE, Talaber said. Deal also saved the popular lottery-funded HOPE scholarship and pre-kindergarten programs from the brink of bankruptcy, she said. (Some of the HOPE changes that ultimately were approved were brokered by a bipartisan group that included Carter.) So with the perspective of both camps, we reached out to Thomas V. O’Brien, chairman of the department of educational studies and research at the University of Southern Mississippi, for help with the long view of Deal in history. O’Brien has researched American education in the 20th century and published a book in 1999, "The Politics of Race and Schooling: Public Education in Georgia, 1890-1961." He said he believes that because of the governor’s funding cuts to education and his stance on school choice, "it is fair to say that Deal is no friend to public education." But a declaration of worst is problematic, O’Brien said. In the 1950s and 1960s, Govs. Herman Talmadge, S. Marvin Griffin and, for a time, Ernest Vandiver threatened to do away with the public schools if they were forced to integrate by race. "They also led the Georgia Legislature to put in place laws that would facilitate such actions," he said. "However, most of their concrete actions that took hold, initiated by Talmadge, were not to cut dollars for public ed, but rather to invest in public education under the ‘separate but equal’ doctrine (Plessy vs. Ferguson, 1896)." The strategy to avoid token desegregation did not work, and, when pushed, the segregationist state leadership under Vandiver kept the public schools and repealed most of the massive resistance legislation, O’Brien said. Thirty-eight Georgia governors served before the Civil War, when there was no public education to speak of, O’Brien said. It was against the law in most places to teach a slave to read, write or do math. Poor whites had no schools, and wealthy whites brought in tutors or sent their children to school in Europe or the North, he said. So where does this leave us? The Carter camp issued a statement saying "Gov. Deal has the worst record on education in the history of this state." Spokesman Bryan Thomas later said the camp was referring to his record on education funding and specifically pointed to austerity cuts during his administration. Annual austerity cuts topped $1 billion in his first three budgets, but also were that high in the last two budgets of his predecessor, Sonny Perdue. The Carter camp can’t prove that among Georgia’s 82 governors Deal’s record is the worst on education in general or on education funding in specific. The Carter campaign’s charge was incendiary -- that the sitting governor has the worst education record in Georgia’s history. And we smell smoke. We award it our lowest rating, Pants On Fire.

pomt-00996	"Scott Walker to cut $300 million from universities, spend $500 million on a pro basketball stadium."	half-true	/wisconsin/statements/2015/feb/06/tweets/scott-walker-wants-cut-college-budgets-13-and-spen/	On Feb. 2, 2015, the day before Gov. Scott Walker unveiled his state budget, Twitter lit up with this claim: "Scott Walker to cut $300 million from universities, spend $500 million on a pro basketball stadium." The tweets were a copy-and-paste of a headline on an article by Think Progress, a liberal blog, that was posted the same day. It was an eye-catching claim that went too far. The cut The first part of the claim in the tweets is on target. More than a week before formally introducing his 2015-'17 budget, Walker revealed that he would propose cutting $300 million over two years from the University of Wisconsin System. Top officials in the system, which includes the University of Wisconsin-Madison flagship and 25 other four-year and two-year schools, said the plan likely would lead to layoffs. In exchange, the system would get more control over its budget and more freedom from state rules in its operations. Walker’s proposed cut -- $150 million for each year of the biennium, for a total of $300 million -- amounts to a 13 percent reduction in state aid for the UW System. That reportedly would be the largest cut ever. It’s worth noting that state funding accounts for $1.2 billion of the system's total budget of $6 billion. Walker’s cut in state aid would amount to 2.5 percent of the total budget. We won't know until mid-2015 whether the cut ultimately becomes part of the final budget approved by the Legislature. But there is no dispute that the $300 million reduction for universities is what Walker has proposed. The arena Money for a new basketball arena is more complicated. The owners of the NBA’s Milwaukee Bucks are trying to assemble private and public financing to build a new arena. The total cost is projected at about $500 million. That is not the amount Walker is proposing to spend. Like the university cuts, Walker announced his arena proposal before making his official budget presentation. He offered $220 million in state bonding -- essentially a form of borrowing -- toward the cost of the arena. Debt payments on the bonds would be repaid from growth in the so-called "jock tax" -- income tax revenue from Milwaukee Bucks players, employees and visiting teams. The rest of the $500 million would come from the Bucks’ current owners, the team’s former owner -- retired U.S. Sen. Herb Kohl -- and possibly from the City of Milwaukee and Milwaukee County. Normally, the growth in jock tax revenue would go to the state’s general fund to help pay for things such as schools, roads and other public services. But the Bucks could leave town in 2017 if a new arena is not in place by the fall of 2017. That is a deadline set by the NBA, which could buy the team back from its owners. In other words, without a new Milwaukee arena, there might not be any jock tax revenue. So, Walker is proposing a diversion of $220 million from the state's general fund to the arena. (A footnote: Although the headline on the Think Progress article said Walker would spend $500 million on the arena, the article itself did make a reference to his plan for $200 million in bonds.) Our rating A slew of tweets claimed: "Scott Walker to cut $300 million from universities, spend $500 million on a pro basketball stadium." Walker's 2015-'17 state budget does propose cutting $300 million from the University of Wisconsin System over the two-year period. The governor also proposes, in the form of bonds, a state contribution for a new Milwaukee arena. But it wouldn't be $500 million -- the total cost of the arena -- but rather $220 million. For a statement that is partially accurate, our rating is Half True. ------ More on Scott Walker For profiles and stories on Scott Walker and 2016 presidential politics, go to the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel's Scott Walker page.

pomt-11149	A "horrible law" requires that children be separated from their parents "once they cross the Border into the U.S."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2018/may/29/donald-trump/trump-blames-democrat-own-policy-separating-family/	President Donald Trump wrongly blamed Democrats for his own administrator’s immigration policy. "Put pressure on the Democrats to end the horrible law that separates children from there (sic) parents once they cross the Border into the U.S.," Trump tweeted. Trump recently told Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen, "I know what you're going through right now with families is very tough, but those are the bad laws that the Democrats gave us. We have to break up families." But there is no law that mandates separating children from their parents. Trump’s own administration devised a policy to that effect. So what is Trump talking about? Whenever parents are charged with a federal misdemeanor (entry without inspection in this case), or awaiting trial, they are placed in the custody of the U.S. Marshals Service. Children cannot go to jail, so they are transferred to the custody of Health and Human Services’ Office of Refugee Resettlement. They are then placed with relatives, juvenile detention centers or foster care. That’s a longstanding Homeland Security policy, DHS told us. Before the Trump administration, immigrants entering illegally as families were rarely prosecuted, said Sarah Pierce, an associate policy analyst of the U.S. Immigration Program at the Migration Policy Institute. Instead, immigrants were held in family detention centers until they were sent to appear before an immigration court or deported. Attorney General Jeff Sessions announced on April 6 the Homeland Security Department would now be referring all illegal border crossings to the Justice Department for prosecution. Facing criminal charges, parents would go to detention centers, leaving their children unaccompanied. It’s the decision to prosecute parents that is causing the separations. "That’s a choice they have made that’s largely different from what other administrations have done," said Peter Margulies, an immigration law and national security law professor at Roger Williams University School of Law. When we asked for evidence of policies separating families, the White House referred us to items determining what happens to unaccompanied immigrant minors. But none of the children in question would be deemed unaccompanied if the Trump administration did not decide to prosecute their parents. The 1997 Flores Settlement Agreement, for example, calls for the release of unaccompanied minors to family members or sponsors who can care for them as their immigration case is resolved. The Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act of 2008, which Trump has wrongly called "a Democrat rule," determines that unaccompanied minors be transferred to Health and Human Services custody. The White House argued such policies encourage parents to send their children into the United States, knowing they will be promptly released. "The cruel and inhumane open borders policies of the Democratic Party are responsible for encouraging mass illegal migration, enabling horrendous child smuggling, and releasing violent MS-13 gang members into American communities," White House deputy press secretary Hogan Gidley said in an emailed statement. The Trump administration may believe that Democrats are responsible for policies that encourage illegal border crossing, but we found no law mandating that children be separated from their parents. Our ruling Trump said a "horrible law" requires that children be separated from their parents "once they cross the Border into the U.S." There is no such law. The Homeland Security Department’s longstanding policy is to separate children from their custodians when they are referred for criminal prosecution. Trump’s administration has decided to prosecute all illegal crossings. Families were rarely prosecuted under previous administrations. We rate this statement False.

pomt-10629	"I took on the worst road system in the country, according to Trucker's magazine. When I left, they said it was the most improved road system in the country."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/jan/11/mike-huckabee/the-roads-are-better-but-still-rank-near-th/	Under fire for raising taxes, Mike Huckabee is citing benefits of the extra tax money: school improvements, health care and better roads. At a debate in Myrtle Beach, S.C., on Jan. 10, 2008, Huckabee repeated a claim he has made several times about how much Arkansas' roads improved. "I took on the worst road system in the country, according to Trucker's magazine," Huckabee said. "When I left, they said it was the most improved road system in the country." We find Huckabee glosses over some details but is right that his state made big improvements. First, we couldn't find such an article in "Trucker's magazine" ... because we couldn't find a magazine by that name. It's clear he is referring to an annual survey done by Overdrive magazine ("The voice of the American trucker"), which asks truck drivers to name the best and worst highways. When Huckabee took office in 1996, Overdrive's survey said Arkansas' roads were fifth worst in the United States. The state kept slipping in the rankings and by 2000 it was indeed the worst in the nation. The shoddy highways persuaded the Arkansas Legislature to raise gasoline and diesel taxes in 1999, which paid for major repairs to the state's road network. That helped. By 2004, Arkansas was rated the state with the most improved roads in Overdrive's annual survey. In 2006, Huckabee's last full year in office, Overdrive did not do overall rankings for the states, so it's a stretch for him to say they were most improved "when I left." However, the truckers that year listed Interstate 40 in Arkansas as the most improved road in the nation. Interstate 30 in Arkansas was No. 4 on the list. Yet despite the improvement that occurred under Huckabee, the state's roads still rate near the bottom overall. In the January 2008 issue, Arkansas is rated fifth worst – the same as when Huckabee took office. "They have done a lot of work," said Andy Duncan, a senior editor for the magazine. "Nevertheless, the consensus is that they have a ways to go." And so while Huckabee is right that the state earned the honor for the most improved roads at one point in his term, it's a stretch to say that was the case when he left office. And Arkansas still lags behind other states. So we rate Huckabee's claim Mostly True.	None	Mike Huckabee	None	None	None	2008-01-11T00:00:00	2008-01-10	['None']
pomt-14588	Says Donald Trump's conversion to pro-life beliefs are akin to Justin Bieber's, who said in the past that abortion "was no big deal to him."	false	/punditfact/statements/2016/feb/05/sarah-palin/sarah-palin-says-donald-trump-justin-bieber-once-s/	What do Donald Trump and Justin Bieber have in common? Humongous hair? Big bucks? How about a case of abortion contortion? Sarah Palin compared their abortion stances during the Feb. 1 edition of CNN's The Lead. Jake Tapper asked the former Alaska governor and Trump supporter about Trump's turnabout on the issue of abortion. "Donald Trump is somebody who has clearly had different positions on issues that he has today," said Tapper. "He called himself very pro-choice. Now he says he's very pro-life." "I am so glad Mr. Trump has seen the light," Palin responded, saying it was sad that anti-abortion groups were giving the candidate a hard time about his switch when other people who have had a change of heart on the issue have been celebrated. She cited, as an example, singer Justin Bieber. Tapper didn't quite understand and, in essence, asked her, what do you mean? Bieber "has made statements understanding the sanctity of life but in the past said (abortion) was no big deal to him," Palin said. "He’s just one example." We wondered whether the pop star really had the same type of conversion as Trump or whether Palin had gone overboard. Trump's change of position on the abortion question is well-established. When Trump was first considering a third-party presidential run in 1999, he said on NBC's Meet the Press that although he hated the concept of abortion, "I am pro-choice in every respect." By mid February 2011, when there was talk again that he would run for president, he declared, "I am pro-life." Whether the Biebs transitioned from abortion support to abortion opposition is not as clear. We contacted Palin through her political action committee and sought comment from Bieber through the office of his manager, Scooter Braun. We didn't hear back from either. So we decided to try to find out for ourselves. No pressure. The only reference to the abortion issue we could find was Bieber's interview with Rolling Stone, published in February 2011. He was 16 at the time. "I really don't believe in abortion. I think (an embryo) is a human," Bieber told the magazine. "It's like killing a baby." When he was asked about abortion in cases of rape, his response was, "Um. Well, I think that's really sad, but everything happens for a reason. I don't know how that would be a reason. I guess I haven't been in that position, so I wouldn't be able to judge that." The rape comment in particular caused some controversy at the time, and since then Bieber has shied away from the issue. He got drawn back into it peripherally when his mother, Pattie Mallette, a born-again Christian, promoted a short anti-abortion film in 2013. Mallette had previously written of the pressure she experienced to have an abortion when she was 17 and carrying the now-pop superstar. The Chicago Sun-Times said in a Jan. 21, 2013, story that it had spoken with an unnamed "longtime Bieber associate" who claimed, "I don't believe he agrees with his mom on this issue." Some might interpret that to mean that Bieber is now pro-abortion — which would signal a new position on abortion that, sorry, does not fit Palin’s point. However, PolitiFact has a policy of not relying on unnamed or secondhand sources to speak for what others believe. Our ruling Palin said Bieber "has made statements understanding the sanctity of life but in the past said (abortion) was no big deal to him." At PolitiFact, we believe it's the responsibility of the person making a claim to provide the evidence to back it up. Palin didn't respond to our query. The only reasonable conclusion at this point is that Bieber hasn’t changed his position on abortion like Trump. Nonetheless, we never say never: If on-the-record evidence of Bieber supporting abortion prior to his Rolling Stone interview turns up, we'll consider a different ruling. Until then, Palin’s claim is not substantiated. We rate her claim False.	None	Sarah Palin	None	None	None	2016-02-05T14:35:53	2016-02-01	['Justin_Bieber']
pomt-04876	"In June, jobless ranks were higher in nearly 90 percent of U.S. cities."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/aug/08/mitt-romney/mitt-romney-says-90-percent-cities-saw-unemploymen/	In an ad titled "It's Just Not Getting Better," Mitt Romney takes aim at President Barack Obama’s handling of the economy. "In June, jobless ranks were higher in nearly 90 percent of U.S. cities," the ad’s narrator says. "In July, unemployment went up again. And the president is running out of time. Under Obama’s economy, it’s just not getting better. Mitt Romney has a plan for a stronger middle class. Under the Romney plan, more jobs and more take-home pay. It’s a plan that works for America." We wondered whether it was really true that "in June, jobless ranks were higher in nearly 90 percent of U.S. cities." The article the ad relied on We found the article the ad cited as its source, an Aug. 1, 2012, Associated Press report. We immediately noticed that the ad had ignored some caution signs that were clearly presented in the story. Here’s what AP wrote: "Unemployment rates rose in nearly 90 percent of large U.S. cities in June, partly because many young people graduated from school with no firm job prospects. "Many of the cities with significant increases in their rates have large universities, where students have begun searching for jobs in recent months. Unlike the national figures, the metro unemployment data isn't seasonally adjusted for such changes. "The Labor Department says unemployment rates rose in 332 large metro areas. They fell in 29 and were unchanged in 11. That's worse than in May, when rates rose in 255 cities." The article confirms that the number used in the ad is correct, and the numbers were worse when compared to the change between April and May. However, it’s also clear that by using that number on its own, the ad is ignoring some crucial context. Between May and June, many high school and college students graduate, inflating the June unemployment numbers. A statistical process called seasonal adjustment corrects for such fluctuations, but as the article stated, the numbers quoted are not seasonally adjusted. As the Romney campaign noted when we asked for comment, post-college unemployment is a significant issue in today’s recession. But there’s a difference between acknowledging the harm of unusually high levels of post-graduation unemployment and letting a sudden influx of new job-seekers in June skew the numbers. Gary Burtless, an economist with the Brookings Institution, told PolitiFact that the unadjusted unemployment rate has jumped from May to June in every single year over the last three decades. But once you seasonally adjust the numbers, many of those increases disappear entirely. So, if you rely only on non-seasonally adjusted figures, then you have to believe that the labor market "has deteriorated in every single June that a Republican has occupied the White House, too" Burtless said. (PolitiFact has noted that Burtless contributed $750 to Obama’s campaign in 2011. However, in 2008 he provided advice on aspects of labor policy to the presidential campaign of Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., and he has worked as a government economist and served on federal advisory panels under presidents of both parties.) What would the seasonally adjusted numbers look like? So is there a better way to look at the data? We asked Tara Sinclair, a George Washington University economist, to walk us through some alternative calculations. First, we did the same calculation as the AP reported on, with one change: We used seasonally adjusted numbers. We found that just under 45 percent of the nearly 400 metro areas had a higher unemployment rate in June than they did in May. That’s half the 90 percent rate cited in Romney’s ad. Next, we asked her to do the same calculation, but limit it to just the 50 biggest cities, to eliminate from the list such small locales as Lewiston, Idaho; Palm Coast, Fla.; Danville, Ill.; Elmira, N.Y.; Kokomo, Ind.; and Longview, Wash. This time, the percentage of metro areas with rising unemployment fell to about 35 percent, or just over one-third the percentage cited in the ad. We also ran the numbers a different way, using a longer time period that diminishes the high volatility inherent in month-to-month comparisons. (While the AP story was clear about the time frame, the ad is not, and viewers wouldn’t know about the timing details without reading the story.) If you compare the figures for June 2011 to June 2012, just 7 percent to 8 percent of metro areas saw an increase in unemployment over the previous year -- almost the exact opposite conclusion as the one cited in Romney’s ad. Our rating The ad claims that "in June, jobless ranks were higher in nearly 90 percent of U.S. cities." The Romney campaign has many grim employment statistics it can legitimately cite in an ad such as this, but using this particular statistic is misleading. The data the campaign relied on was not seasonally adjusted, so unemployment levels were exaggerated by the sudden graduation of high school and college students -- a caveat that was specifically noted high up in the story that the ad cited as its source. As it turns out, even the highest seasonally adjusted calculation we made is just half the size of the 90 percent cited in the ad. And excluding volatile month-to-month figures by looking at a full year-long comparison actually leads to the exact opposite conclusion from the one drawn in the ad: Better than 90 percent of metro areas saw unemployment drop, not rise, over the previous year. We rate this claim Mostly False.	None	Mitt Romney	None	None	None	2012-08-08T15:37:35	2012-08-05	['United_States']
pomt-07768	In Wisconsin, teachers make $89,000 in salary and benefits, compared to $48,000 for all other workers in the United States.	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/feb/23/eric-bolling/fox-business-news-eric-bolling-says-wisconsin-teac/	In an interview on Feb. 21. 2011, Fox Business Network anchor Eric Bolling sparred with U.S. Rep. Charles Rangel, D-NY, over the contentious teachers union battle in Wisconsin that has captured the attention of the entire nation. Rangel argued that "the benefits we enjoy as working people and our standard of living is due, in no small part, to the trade union movement," and "the whole idea that they got to tell these people that they have decided that they're against collective bargaining, you talk about democracy? You never heard anything like this..." Bolling responded by citing statistics about pay and benefits enjoyed by Wisconsin teachers compared to the rest of the working public. "We got blackboard, here it is, Wisconsin teachers make a salary of $51,000...Benefits $38,000 per year, that comes to a whopping 89,000 bucks, while the rest of us, all workers in the United States, union, non-union, etc., $38,000 is your average salary...there, $10,000 in benefits, a quarter of what you make, that you would make if you were a Wisconsin teacher, to 48 grand, almost half the amount. Yet collective bargaining says that is OK. That's not anti-free market?" Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker’s budget proposal asks state workers to pay more for their pensions and health insurance, which reduces take-home pay. Union leaders have largely conceded to the salary and pension cuts, but Walker's plan also sets significant limits on collective bargaining power for most public sector unions, which has enraged union members and sparked protests at the state capital. Still, much of the political chatter about the Wisconsin showdown has continued to focus on salary and benefit issues, so we decided to check Bolling's numbers. Bolling was pretty close on the average salary figure for Wisconsin teachers. The latest figures from the National Education Association actually put the average salary for a Wisconsin teacher at $51,264. The $51,000 salary figure is further substantiated by district-by-district data provided by the Wisconsin Department of Public Instruction. However, according to a spokeswoman for the Wisconsin Education Association Council, the Fox figure for Wisconsin teacher benefits -- $39,000 -- is way too high. Average benefits amount to about $25,000 a year, said Marlena Deutsch, a spokeswoman for WEAC. In total compensation, Wisconsin ranks 23rd in the nation. We couldn't find a definitive, independent state average for benefits in Wisconsin, but the data from the state Department of Public Instruction lists "fringe benefits" by district in Wisconsin. None were as high as $39,000. The median was about $25,800. OK, now to the Average Joe or Jane who works in the private sector. According to a national compensation survey conducted by the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the total cost of compensation to private industry employees last year came to about $58,000 ($41,000 for salary; $17,000 for benefits). So Bolling's total compensation number for Wisconsin teachers is high, and for private sector employees, it's is low. On his show the following night (Feb. 22) Bolling said in the numbers he had posted the night before, "our math was off a bit." A new graphic, he said, showed the unweighted average for Wisconsin teachers for the 2010 school year: a $51,000 salary, plus $30,000 worth of benefits (for a total of $81,000 worth of compensation). For an average private sector worker, he said, the salary in 2010 was $46,000 with $20,000 worth of benefits (total compensation $66,000). Those revised numbers are much closer to the ones we found. But many statisticians have a more fundamental issue with Bolling's comparison. In order to be a teacher in Wisconsin, you've got to have a 4-year college degree. And 52 percent of Wisconsin teachers also have a master's degree. That's much, much higher than the average education level for workers in the private sector. People with higher degrees in education typically get paid more. We found two studies that factored in such things as education level, years of experience, race, gender, etc. and found that public employees tend to make a little less than people with similar backgrounds in the private sector. A report titled "Out of Balance" by two University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee professors for the National Institute of Retirement Security, whose board is largely composed of representatives of public employee pensions, found that when "comparable earning determinants," such as education, are considered, state employees typically earn salaries 11 percent lower than their private sector counterparts. When you consider total compensation -- salary plus benefits -- the deficit dropped to 6.8 percent (because public employees generally get better benefits packages than those in the private sector). One of the study authors, Keith A. Bender, an associate professor in the Department of Economics at the University of Wisconsin–Milwaukee, said that message has largely been lost in the Wisconsin debate. As for Bollings' comparison, Bender said, "I guess you can do that if you don't want to compare like with like. But you are comparing less educated people with more educated people." Another report, by the liberal Economic Policy Institute, found that Wisconsin public employees earn 4.8 percent less in total compensation than comparable private-sector workers. The study's author, Jeff Keefe, issued a policy memo on Feb. 15, 2011, titled "Wisconsin public versus private employee costs: Why compare apples to oranges?" "Inaccurate comparisons of national and Wisconsin public employee compensation with private sector compensation are circulating in Wisconsin," Keefe wrote. "These faulty comparisons, showing that public employees in Wisconsin are dramatically overpaid, seem to support legislative efforts to increase benefit contributions by public employees." "But when we compare apples to apples, we find that Wisconsin public employees earn 4.8% less in total compensation than comparable private sector workers," Keefe wrote. "The comparisons—controlling for education, experience, hours of work, organizational size, gender, race, ethnicity, citizenship, and disability—demonstrate that full-time state and local public employees earn lower wages and receive less in total compensation (including all benefits) than comparable private sector employees. "Why does it appear otherwise? Both nationally and within Wisconsin, public sector workers are significantly more educated than their private sector counterparts." The Center for Union Facts, a self-described "union watchdog," said Keefe's study made two assumptions "both of which bias the results in its preferred direction." The first assumption was that state employees would otherwise be working in a large private sector business with 1,000 employees or more, the group said. And, it argues, Keefe excluded full-time, part-year workers like certain teachers. According to an analysis released by the Center for Union Facts on Feb. 22, 2011, public sector employees, on average, earn five percent more in wages and benefits than their counterparts in the private sector. We don't want to get too far into the weeds on the many ways data can be sliced to make comparisons between public and private sector compensation. We don't take too much issue with the raw numbers provided by Bolling (the clarified ones). They're pretty close to the numbers we found as well. But the comparison of compensation for Wisconsin teachers to the compensation for all private sector employees is misleading. On average, Wisconsin teachers are far more highly educated than the average worker. People with higher levels of education tend to make more. And so we rate Bollings' comparison Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.

pomt-04843	"We do know that Romney personally approved over $70 million in fictional losses to the IRS as part of the notorious 'Son of Boss' tax scandal, one of the largest tax avoidance schemes in history."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/aug/13/barack-obama/obama-links-romney-infamous-tax-shelter/	Barack Obama expanded his assault on Mitt Romney’s business ethics with a new ad that connects Romney to dodging taxes. The ad opens with a clip of Romney in an interview. Interviewer: Was there ever any year when you paid lower than the 13.9 percent? Romney: I haven’t calculated that. I’m happy to go back and look. Announcer: Did Romney pay 10 percent? 5 percent? Zero? We don’t know. But we do know that Romney personally approved over $70 million in fictional losses to the IRS as part of the notorious "Son of Boss" tax scandal, one of the largest tax avoidance schemes in history. Isn’t it time for Romney to come clean? If you haven’t heard of it, Son of Boss was a tax dodge that swept the country in the 1990s and allowed well-heeled investors and corporations to hide billions of dollars in taxes they owed the government. We thought we should examine this new allegation and see whether Romney truly did have a hand in advancing a spurious tax shelter. Marriott International and Son of Boss The substance of this claim goes to Romney’s years on the board of Marriott International. According to Bloomberg News, he joined the board of directors in 1993 and became head of the board’s Audit Committee, a position he held for six years. By this point, Romney had already established himself as a successful fund manager. His second year on the board, Marriott took advantage of a tax reduction method that Daniel Shaviro, a tax professor at the New York University School of Law, described to us this way: "You and I purport to give each other, say $70 million. (But these cash flows are themselves largely fictional - e.g., I ‘borrow’ from you the money that I am ‘paying’ you). I then deduct the $70 million that I paid you, and don't include the $70 million that you paid me. End of story." Complex partnerships, financial securities and the occasional offshore accounts were used to mask reality. The method went by the name of Son of Boss, named after a similar discredited tax scheme called BOSS, or Bond Option Sales Strategy. It was marketed aggressively by tax accountants nationwide, including some of the largest accounting firms. The Internal Revenue Service began cracking down in 2000. In 2008, the government estimated $6 billion in taxes had gone uncollected. A series of court decisions stated that the perpetrators were guilty of "subverting the legislative purpose of the tax code by engaging in transactions that are fictitious or lack economic reality simply to reap a tax benefit." Citing court documents, Bloomberg reported that in 1994, an investment banker faxed a proposal to a senior tax attorney at Marriott. By creating new partnerships, the company could post a paper tax loss without doing itself any real financial harm. This was Son of Boss in action. Through it, Marriott reported $71 million in losses that the courts ultimately decided did not exist. By the mid-2000s, Marriott was in court defending its use of this tax shelter. In 2008 it lost; the company appealed and lost again in 2009. Romney’s role The central question is, did Romney know what was going on and did he sign off? The ad relies on the opinion of two tax attorneys, Edward Kleinbard and Peter Canellos, who wrote that "Romney approved the firm's reporting of fictional tax losses." The authors go on to express their opinion that Romney had the expertise to understand the nature of the scheme and had the fiduciary responsibility to review it. There is only one certain fact about Romney’s role at Marriott. At some point, the board would have reviewed and accepted various financial filings and audit reports that included the tax losses claimed under Son of Boss. What we don’t know is whether the board or the audit committee specifically discussed the tax shelter itself, either before it was used or when it delivered the promised tax savings. On this point, we have no outright denial from the Romney campaign. We asked the campaign if Romney approved the use of Son of Boss and they referred us to Marriott International. At Marriott, Stephanie Hampton, senior director of global corporate communications told us, "None of our directors has actively initiated or coordinated the company's tax planning strategies." But this is no denial. Initiating and coordinating are not what board Audit Committees do. The ad claims that Romney approved the deal, not that he initiated it or coordinated it. Absent a denial, we enter the hazy world of the role of corporate board audit committees in 1994. "The standards for audit committees compared to what we see now were more modest," said Joe Carcello, professor of accounting at the University of Tennessee. Carcello told us he is skeptical that company managers would have brought this transaction before the board at all. If they did, he expects the managers would have told board members, "We vetted this with the tax lawyers and they say this is a legitimate transaction," Carcello said. "Unless the audit committee had three or four tax lawyers, they wouldn’t have any reason to question it." Accounting experts seem to share this view, but tax lawyers have a different opinion. The lawyers cited by the Obama campaign say by 1994, the New York State Bar had issued warnings about tax shelters of this sort. Shaviro at New York University told us there would be ample reason to question the transaction. The company was claiming a large loss but it wasn’t actually losing any money. To Shaviro, the follow ups would be obvious: "Can this really work? Do the tax lawyers agree? Is it too good to be true?" Linda Beale, a professor at Wayne State Law School, said, "The audit committee is the place to draw the line on improper behavior." Romney seems to have taken his board duties seriously. Bloomberg cited a fellow Marriott board member, Gilbert Grosvenor, who said Romney examined the company financial statements closely. "Certainly deeper than we did as members," Grosvenor told Bloomberg. Marriott International said the company "takes prudent precautions, including seeking the advice of outside professionals, to ensure our tax strategy is consistent with Federal, state and foreign tax laws and regulations." It is important to note that in 1994, the federal government had yet to crack down on these tax schemes. Our ruling The Obama ad says Romney personally approved $70 million in fictional tax losses through the Son of Boss tax shelter. Marriott International used Son of Boss. At the time, the illegality of the scheme had not been proven in court, but the nature of it was clear to all participants. Romney was head of Marriott’s audit committee at the time. Experts disagree on whether the corporate board would have known about the deal and had the chance to question it. The company neither confirmed nor denied that the board approved the transaction. At some point, the board would have approved filings that included the fraudulent losses, but it’s unclear whether Romney specifically favored the tax move. The statement includes a measure of truth but ignores important context. We rate it Half True.	None	Barack Obama	None	None	None	2012-08-13T15:04:31	2012-08-09	['None']
pomt-11436	Rep. Pittenger is "constantly rated as one of the most liberal Republicans in Congress."	false	/north-carolina/statements/2018/mar/15/mark-harris/robert-pittenger-among-most-liberal-republican-con/	Rev. Mark Harris came within 134 votes of beating U.S. Rep. Robert Pittenger two years ago in the Republican primary for his seat, so he’s trying again this year. And to close the voting gap before the May 8 primary, Harris is questioning Pittenger’s conservative credentials. Pittenger has represented North Carolina’s 9th Congressional District since 2013, when he succeeded retiring Republican Sue Myrick. A Charlotte resident, Pittenger previously served in the state Senate and in 2008 ran unsuccessfully for Lt. Governor. In a recent newsletter, Harris criticized Pittenger for supporting a spending bill that raised the debt ceiling. "Robert Pittenger showed us yet again why he is constantly rated as one of the most liberal Republicans in Congress," the newsletter says. There are 535 voting members of Congress (the House of Representatives and the Senate). Republicans control Congress with nearly 300 seats: 238 in the House and 51 seats in the Senate. The term "most liberal" is somewhat subjective. But PolitiFact wondered whether conservative watchdog groups have consistently singled out Pittenger as liberal since he won North Carolina’s 9th Congressional district in 2013. We reached out to the Harris campaign to see what ratings systems he’s referencing in the newsletter. What Harris said The primary source for the statement is a rating by Conservative Review, according to Harris campaign spokesman Andy Yates. Conservative Review is a website founded by Mark Levin, a controversial radio personality who has referred to Republican Senate leader Mitch McConnell as a "dummy" and "failure." "Pittenger has a 55% F grade with them. It is the second worst grade of any NC Republican House member (McHenry is the worst)," Yates said in an email, referring to Rep. Patrick McHenry, who represents NC’s 10th Congressional district. "Pittenger has consistently graded out as an F with this group which marks him as one of the most liberal Republicans in Congress." Yates is right about Pittenger’s standing among the 10 other North Carolina Republicans in the House. Whether that puts him among the most liberal Republicans depends on how one defines "most liberal." According to Conservative Review’s scorecard, there are about 90 House Republicans – about 36 percent – who have lower "Liberty Scores" than Pittenger. Among those with lower scores than Pittenger: House Speaker Paul Ryan and majority whip Steve Scalise. Yates also cited Pittenger’s 2018 rating with FreedomWorks, which is zero. FreedomWorks is a libertarian-leaning advocacy group. The scorecard mostly covers fiscal policy, civil liberties and regulatory issues, said Jason Pye, vice president of legislative affairs at FreedomWorks. Pye referred to Pittenger as "unreliable" when it comes to reining in spending. Pittenger "generally votes with leadership, and they like to bust spending caps and bust the budget — things we’re opposed to," Pye said. Pittenger has a "Lifetime Score" of 70 with the FreedomWorks. There are about 114 House members with lower lifetime scores than Pittenger. Pittenger’s score places him slightly to the right of California Republican Devin Nunes and slightly to the left of U.S. Sen. Richard Burr, also of North Carolina. Pittenger’s lifetime ratings on FreedomWorks or Conservative Review aren’t extremely liberal (or conservative.) To get a full picture of Pittenger’s record, we consulted other sources as well. What others said Pittenger votes out-of-step with the majority of Republicans 5.5 percent of the time, according to ProPublica. The group says that’s close to the average for Republicans in Congress. He has a score of 90 percent with Heritage Action for America, a watchdog group and think tank that says it "turns conservative ideas into reality on Capitol Hill." The average score for House Republicans is 68 percent. According to a vote tracker on FiveThirtyEight.com, Pittenger’s votes are aligned with Trump 96.9 percent of the time. And there are dozens of Republican House members who vote in-step with Trump less than Pittenger. He has a perfect score with FRC Action, which advocates for conservative social issues. As of 2016, Pittenger also had an 88 lifetime rating with The American Conservative Union, another leading conservative organization. The Club For Growth, which tracks legislation that affects the economy, gives Pittenger a lifetime score of 79 percent – which is in the middle-of-the-road for House Republicans. VoteView.com, meanwhile, says Pittenger is more conservative than 68 percent of Republicans in the House. It would be one thing if Harris said Pittenger isn't taking a strong enough stance on fiscal issues, even if it means voting against the party. Harris could make a case there. But, "to make the assertion that Pittenger is one of the most liberal Republicans is a stretch too far," said Michael Bitzer, chair of the politics department at Catawba College in Salisbury, NC. Our ruling Harris said Pittenger is "constantly rated as one of the most liberal Republicans in Congress." We can’t find the results to back that up. So we rate this claim False.

pomt-04887	"When I left the Senate, we were on a trajectory towards a balanced budget."	half-true	/virginia/statements/2012/aug/07/george-allen/george-allen-says-us-was-path-balanced-budget-when/	Republican George Allen says the federal budget was in decent shape when he left the U.S. Senate in January 2007. "When I left the Senate, we were on a trajectory towards a balanced budget," Allen said during a July 22 debate in Hot Springs with Democrat Tim Kaine, his opponent for the U.S. Senate. Kaine has repeatedly criticized Allen for casting votes during his term in the Senate that helped turn a budget surplus Allen inherited into deficits. We were curious whether Allen’s response -- that the nation was on a course towards a balanced budget at the end of his term -- is correct. When Allen came into the Senate in January 2001, the government was running its fourth straight fiscal year of surpluses, taking in $121 billion more than it was spending and paying down the federal debt, then valued at $3.3 trillion. In fiscal 2002, the U.S. began its current streak of running deficits. The economy slowed that year, and a number of measures that Allen backed during his term contributed to the red ink: two foreign conflicts, tax cuts and the expansion of Medicare to cover prescription costs. The deficit swelled to $413 billion in fiscal 2004 and contracted to $161 billion in fiscal 2007, when Allen left the Senate after an election defeat. The Allen campaign, in a website post, cited the steadily declining deficits from 2004 to 2007 as proof of Allen’s statement that the U.S. was heading towards a balanced budget at the end of his term. The campaign also cites budget projections released by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office in January 2007, shortly after Allen left office. The CBO predicted that deficits would gradually diminish and the budget essentially would be balanced in 2011 and produce a surplus in 2012 and afterwards. But there’s an important caveat that the Allen campaign glosses over. CBO projections are made with an assumption that policies currently in effect will not change. And when the CBO released the report cited by Allen, major tax cuts approved under President George W. Bush in 2001 and 2003 were scheduled to expire at the end of 2010. The Bush tax cuts have since been reset to end at the end of this year. Allen, in his unsuccessful 2006 campaign against Democrat Jim Webb, repeatedly called for the Bush tax cuts to be extended permanently, a position he has strongly maintained in this year’s race against Kaine. In other words, Allen’s proof that the U.S. was on a trajectory towards a balanced budget when he left the Senate relies on ending the Bush tax cuts -- an action that he has long opposed. We wondered what would have happened if Allen had gotten his way and the tax cuts were permanently extended during his term. Would the U.S. have still been on a path towards a balanced budget when Allen left the Senate? Let’s examine this through the lens of January 2007, the final month of Allen’s term. Back then, the nation was in its fourth month of a fiscal year that would produce a $161 billion deficit. The CBO was projecting improvement to a $170 billion surplus for 2012. But pivotal to the nation returning to black ink was $332.2 billion in added revenues from the expiration of the Bush tax cuts. If the tax cuts had been made permanent, the U.S. would have been heading towards a $162.2 billion deficit in 2012. The red ink would have grown to a $242.7 billion in 2016, according to CBO figures, before falling slightly to $210.7 billion in 2017. So in terms of raw dollars, the deficit would have been expected to slowly increase during the 10 years after Allen’s departure if the Bush tax cuts had been made permanent. Many economists say the best way to compare deficits through history is to measure them against the Gross Domestic Product -- the market value of all goods and services produced by a nation. The comparison to GDP provides a gauge of a country’s ability to absorb its deficit. In fiscal 2007, the U.S. deficit that was 1.2 percent of its GDP. A computation of figures in the CBO report issued that January show that if the Bush tax cuts had been made permanent, the deficit would have dropped to 0.9 percent of GDP this year, risen to 1.2 percent next year and leveled at 1.1 percent in 2014 and 2015, risen to 1.2 percent in 2016 and dropped to 1 percent in 2017. So if the Bush cuts had become permanent before Allen left the Senate, little long-term change would have been expected in size of the deficit compared to the GDP. Of course, many of the numbers bandied about in 2007 seem now rosy in the light of the $1.3 trillion U.S. budget deficit expected this year. Hindsight is perfect, and back in 2007 the CBO couldn’t predict collapses in the housing and financial markets that led to the Great Recession. Our ruling Allen, trying to refute charges he voted to run up federal deficits, said the U.S. was "on a trajectory towards a balanced budget" when he left the Senate in 2007. Allen’s campaign cites a 2007 CBO report that said Washington was on the road to budget surpluses, starting in 2012. But those projections were based on the assumption that the Bush tax cuts would end as scheduled in 2010. And Allen has maintained since at least 2006 that the tax reductions should be made permanent. Had Allen prevailed on the tax cuts, figures in the 2007 CBO report point to the deficit slowly rising in raw dollars over the next eight years. The deficit, as a percentage of GDP, would have been only a smidgen lower in 2015 than it was in 2007. So Allen is right that the U.S. was projected to be on a trajectory towards a balanced budget when his Senate term ended. But he omits a key detail that creates a different impression: the projected path towards a balanced budget required a step Allen refused to take -- ending the Bush tax cuts. We rate Allen’s statement Half True.	None	George Allen	None	None	None	2012-08-07T06:00:00	2012-07-21	['None']
pomt-03061	"(Texas Republicans) believe in abolishing Social Security, abolishing V.A. health care."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2013/oct/02/bernie-sanders/sen-bernie-sanders-says-texas-republicans-want-abo/	There have been no shortage of claims about Obamacare in the build up to the health insurance marketplaces opening on Oct. 1. On MSNBC, Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., called the effort by some Republicans to defund Obamacare in exchange for funding the government "nickels and dimes" in comparison with other stances they take. "What Mr. (Ted) Cruz and his Republican friends think in terms of health care is that we should voucherize Medicare, make massive cuts in Medicaid and ignore the fact 48 million Americans have no health insurance at all," he said Sept. 25. He used the Republican Party of Texas to criticize the beliefs of the entire party. "If you look at something like the Texas Republican platform, do you know what they believe in? They believe not only in getting rid of Obamacare," he said. "They believe in abolishing Social Security, abolishing V.A. (Veterans Affairs) health care." It’s not shocking that most Republicans would have differing views on these programs than Sanders, who caucuses with the Democrats. But do they really call for these services to be abolished? We wanted to find out. Sanders was referring to the Republican Party of Texas 2012 party platform, spokesman Michael Briggs told PolitiFact in an email. We noticed the platform’s language called for the "privatization" of both government programs, but never mentioned the word "abolish" or anything similar. GOP Texas Chairman Steve Munisteri said the group does not support abolishment. "To me, both statements he made are grossly inaccurate," he said. Let’s delve further into each issue. Proposed Social Security changes Munisteri emphasized that the proposed Social Security changes would not affect retirees and near-retirees, who have already paid into the Social Security system. Then, for younger people, the platform calls for a "transition to a system of private pensions based on the concept of individual retirement accounts." According to previous proposed privatization plans, this would entail individuals redirecting all or part of their current Social Security taxes to a personal account, which would be invested in some sort of asset, said Michael Tanner, a senior fellow at the libertarian Cato Institute who specializes in Social Security policy. "They’re very different programs, but there still exists a mandatory, government-regulated retirement program," he said. "People would not be free to invest in their brother-in-law’s South American gold mining stock." Former President George W. Bush and others have proposed many Social Security privatization plans over the years, but we should note that the platform Sanders referenced doesn’t cite any specific proposal. Still, privatizing Social Security isn’t the same thing as abolishing it. Efficient care for veterans The Republican Party of Texas platform directly addresses health care for veterans, saying, "The Veterans Administration must become more responsive and more efficient by eliminating its backlog and reducing waiting times for treatment. We support the privatization of veterans' heath care." To Munisteri, the platform’s call for the privatization of health care means exploring a system in which the government would pay veterans to seek out private health care. Currently, veterans enrolled in the program seek treatment from government-funded facilities. "The current system is causing veterans to wait too long (for treatment)," he said. "We support having other options available for veterans." Kevin Bacon, a public affairs professor at the University of Texas at Austin, said abolishment of a health care system -- one that includes more than 8.7 million veterans, 150 hospitals and 80 clinics -- would not be a realistic stance. Veterans face a unique set of medical issues that need to be treated, like multiple amputations and PTSD, he said. "Privatization is one of those terms that have so many different flavors to it," Bacon said, noting the complexity of the issue. There are lots of different propositions out there to privatize health care, but no serious options call for an end to providing health care for veterans, Bacon said. Due to a host of different possibilities within the realm of privatized veterans’ care and again, a broad statement from the GOP platform, it’s unclear to us if the V.A. facilities would remain open if the system were privatized. In any case, the Oxford dictionary defines "abolish" as meaning to "formally put an end to (a system, practice, or institution)." While the privatization of either system Sanders mentioned could drastically change the way these issues are handled, the government would not be removing itself from the responsibility of providing either of these services. Generally speaking, government-funded medical treatment for veterans and retirement benefits for seniors would still exist in some form. Our ruling Sanders' claim that the Texas GOP wants to "abolish" Social Security and VA health care didn’t line up with the official 2012 party platform, which called for a "privatization" of both programs. Privatization could bring systemic shake-ups to either issue in question, but wouldn’t entirely eliminate the programs. While the state party would like veterans to get their health care through private plans and young people to direct their Social Security taxes to private accounts, we found no evidence that GOP Texans are pushing to eliminate either system entirely. We rate Sanders' claim False.	None	Bernie Sanders	None	None	None	2013-10-02T09:44:23	2013-09-25	['None']
pomt-07032	Two years ago we had "the largest structural deficit ever in Wisconsin."	false	/wisconsin/statements/2011/jul/03/scott-walker/gov-walker-says-2-years-ago-we-had-largest-deficit/	In recent weeks, there has been a lot of talk about the state’s "structural" deficit, and how Republican Gov. Scott Walker and the GOP-controlled Legislature eliminated it in the 2011-13 budget. During the 2010 campaign, Walker railed against the use of one-time budget maneuvers, which pushed problems into future budgets. Walker returned to the topic in a June 21, 2011, appearance as a guest host on CNBC’s "Squawk Box," touting his own approach. "We had two years ago the largest structural deficit ever in Wisconsin," Walker said. "One of the things where in many ways they were kicking the can into the future, delaying payments, pushing things off, raided transportation funds and took stimulus money." He added: "And in this budget we wiped that out and put in place structural changes." Among the changes: The controversial collective bargaining bill, which requires state workers to contribute more for their pensions and health insurance. In effect, it is a pay cut for workers, which means a savings for taxpayers. From a fiscal perspective, the change is viewed as permanent, rather than a one-time change, said Robert Lang, director of Wisconsin’s non-partisan Legislative Fiscal Bureau. But what about the claim that two years ago, under Democratic Gov. Jim Doyle, the structural deficit was at its largest point? The structural deficit is a projection that measures the future imbalance between spending and tax revenue as laid out in state law. The fiscal bureau started calculating the structural deficit with the 1997-99 budget. The structural deficit differs from budget shortfalls caused, for instance, by reduced tax collections due to a poor economy. By law, the two-year budgets must be balanced when approved. But because they are based on projections, things frequently change when expenses rise (or fall) or revenue comes in lower (or higher) than anticipated. If you look back two years, the structural deficit for the 2009-11 state budget -- when Doyle was in office -- was $1.682 billion, according to a June 13, 2011 fiscal bureau report. But that’s not the largest ever measured. Rather, it’s the third highest in the 14 years that the agency has compiled the reports. The worst: a $2.867 billion structural deficit from the 2003-05 budget. We asked Walker spokesman Cullen Werwie about the governor’s statement. He referred us to the Walker’s executive budget, submitted earlier this year and had no further comment. That document includes a chart that shows -- without attribution -- structural deficits as calculated by the fiscal bureau. It takes the extra step of showing which governor was in charge for each deficit. Under the largest structural deficit is the name McCallum. That would be Gov. Scott McCallum, a Republican. So what’s the bottom line? Appearing on a national cable TV show viewed by some 269,000 people, Walker said the state’s largest structural deficit had come two years earlier, under his Democratic predecessor. He was off by seven years and a political party. We rate his statement False. Editor's note: An earlier version of this item incorrectly stated that Scott McCallum was acting governor.

pomt-09511	The stimulus bill "didn’t create one new job."	pants on fire!	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/feb/18/scott-brown/scott-brown-says-stimulus-didnt-create-one-new-job/	A major theme in Republican complaints about the $862 billion stimulus program is that it didn't deliver enough jobs. Republican Sen. Scott Brown of Massachusetts took that view to an extreme, claiming that it didn't create any new jobs. Here's what he said during a Feb. 4, 2010, news conference, shortly after he was sworn in. “The last stimulus bill didn’t create one new job, and in some states the money that was actually released hasn’t even been used yet,” Brown said. ABC's Jonathan Karl immediately followed up. “It didn’t create one new job?” Karl asked. “That’s correct. We lost another 85,000 jobs again, give or take, last month,” Brown responded. “And in Massachusetts, it hasn’t created one new job and throughout the country as well. It may have retained some, but it hasn’t created any new jobs." There are two ways to analyze this question -- looking at jobs created directly by the stimulus, and looking at jobs created in the broader economy since the stimulus bill took effect. We'll look first at jobs funded directly by the stimulus. According to Recovery.gov -- the Obama administration's Web site that tracks the stimulus effort -- the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act created or saved 634,042 jobs between Feb. 17, 2009, and Sept. 30, 2009, and it funded 595,263 jobs between Oct. 1, 2009, and Dec. 31, 2009. The data come from reports filed by the primary recipient of stimulus funds such as state and local governments and private-sector companies. These numbers aren't perfect. They meld bits and pieces of part-time jobs into "full-time equivalent" jobs, and the two periods use different criteria for job counting, due to a change dictated by the Office of Management and Budget in December 2009. (For the earlier of the two periods cited above, the number refers to jobs created or saved; for the later of the two periods, it refers to the number of jobs funded by the stimulus without reference to whether that funding created or saved a job.) Also, the Government Accountability Office, the investigative arm of Congress, concluded in November 2009 that "there are a range of significant reporting and quality issues that need to be addressed" in this reporting system. So these statistics may overstate the actual number of jobs created. But not by enough to make Brown's zero-jobs claim accurate. So there's strong evidence that the stimulus has created lots of jobs directly through federal spending. What about the economy as a whole? Economists have been estimating the impact of the stimulus on jobs by comparing two numbers: current employment statistics and an estimate of what those employment numbers would have looked like had there been no stimulus. In a report released on Jan. 13, 2010, the president's Council of Economic Advisers estimated that between 1.77 million jobs and 2.07 million jobs were created or saved by the stimulus through the fourth quarter of 2009. Separately, the council's report cited four independent analyses of the same question. These estimates were by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, as well by three private-sector economic-analysis firms. Here's what those groups found: • CBO: Between 800,000 jobs (low estimate) and 2.4 million jobs (high estimate) saved or created. • IHS/Global Insight: 1.25 million jobs saved or created. • Macroeconomic Advisers: 1.06 million jobs saved or created. • Moody's economy.com: 1.59 million jobs saved or created. A couple of caveats: These estimates are based on economic models that vary somewhat from study to study, and not everyone buys the idea that it's possible to measure how the economy would have fared in the absence of a stimulus. Indeed, some economists, including many conservatives, believe that the multiplier effect from the stimulus is small or nonexistent. "Every dollar Congress injects into the economy must first be taxed or borrowed out of the economy," writes economist Brian Riedl of the conservative Heritage Foundation. "No new purchasing power is created; it is merely transferred from one part of the economy to another. ... Removing water from one end of a swimming pool and pouring it in the other end will not raise the overall water level -- no matter how large the bucket. Similarly, borrowing money from one part of the economy and redistributing to another part of the economy will not create new growth -- no matter how big the stimulus bill." We acknowledge that there's some dispute on this question. Still, the independent estimates we've seen have credibility, and they all agree that at least 1 million jobs have been created or saved. That, in combination with the hundreds of thousands of jobs cited on recovery.gov as being funded directly by the stimulus, contradicts Brown's assertion that the bill "didn’t create one new job." But if Brown had chosen his words more carefully, he could have scored better on the Truth-O-Meter. He's right that the economy as a whole has been losing jobs almost every single month since January 2008. According to a chart prepared by the Obama White House, there has been positive job growth in only one month during that period -- November 2009. (In his news conference comment, Brown actually underestimated the net job losses in December 2009, which was the most recent month for which data was available before he spoke; it was about 150,000, rather than 85,000.) So if Brown had said that the national economy hasn't seen any net gain in jobs since the stimulus bill was passed, he would have earned himself a True. A spokesman for Brown, Eric Fehrnstrom, made that point to us in an interview. "The fact is that we have lost jobs every month since the stimulus passed," Fehrnstrom said. "No amount of political spin can change that fact." But that's not what Brown said. He said the stimulus bill "didn’t create one new job" and, when asked to clarify, he said it "hasn’t created any new jobs." It's perfectly reasonable to question whether the $862 billion was well spent and whether it is good economic policy. But that money has clearly resulted in tens of thousands of jobs that wouldn't exist otherwise. It's preposterous to claim that no new jobs came out of it. We find his claim Pants on Fire!

pomt-05368	Says Austin Mayor Lee Leffingwell voted for a toll lane on MoPac.	true	/texas/statements/2012/may/09/brigid-shea/austin-mayoral-hopeful-brigid-shea-says-incumbent-/	In a recent Austin mayoral debate, challenger Brigid Shea and incumbent Lee Leffingwell sparred over a plan to expand MoPac Boulevard, with Shea ultimately saying that Leffingwell voted to add a toll lane to the frequently congested north-south expressway. We wondered whether Shea was right about Leffingwell’s record. First, let’s flash back to their exchange during the debate aired April 16, 2012, by KXAN-TV, Channel 36. Shea began by saying the city hasn’t done enough to ease congestion on Austin’s roads. But, she said, one approach she doesn’t support is "putting toll lanes on MoPac." Leffingwell responded that the decision to add a toll lane to MoPac (Loop 1) "has not been made" and that under the plan in progress, no existing lanes would be tolled. The new lane on MoPac "would be a high occupancy lane," Leffingwell said. "It would be reserved for bus rapid transit and express buses and for registered car pools. It would also facilitate the movement of emergency vehicles such as police, fire and EMS vehicles. There has been some discussion of placing a variable toll on that lane only, not on the rest of MoPac, which would make it usable for folks in their private automobiles to use. It would be a variable-type toll depending on the movement of traffic in that lane to make sure it moves quickly. … If the speed goes down, the toll would go up. If the speed goes up, the toll would go down. That’s under discussion right now, and hopefully, that project will begin in 2014." Shea shot back: "All the transportation experts that I’ve spoken with have said you might call it an HOV lane, but it’s really a toll lane. And the mayor has voted for it in the three-year TIP transportation plan." Shea was more blunt in a recent mailer to voters, saying: "Lee voted for a toll lane on MoPac." Over the years, various ideas have been floated to relieve congestion on MoPac, which opened in the 1970s. The current plan — to be built and operated by the Central Texas Regional Mobility Authority, with most of the funding from the Texas Department of Transportation — includes adding an "express lane" to each side of MoPac for the approximately 11-mile stretch from Lady Bird Lake north to Parmer Lane. At the debate, Leffingwell described the additional lanes as "high occupancy." Then again, the MoPac express lanes wouldn’t be the same as the "high occupancy vehicle," or HOV, lanes found in some urban areas. Often called "car-pool lanes," they are typically reserved for vehicles carrying more than one or two people; some allow solo drivers to use them if they pay a toll. But Central Texas never adopted the HOV strategy, according to a Jan. 30, 2012, Austin American-Statesman news article, "and the MoPac express lanes won’t change that." Instead, as Leffingwell indicated, the additional northbound and southbound lanes would be open — for no charge — to transit buses, registered vanpools and emergency and military vehicles. Everyone else who wanted to hop in the express lane would have to pay a toll, the amount of which would change minute by minute depending on the level of traffic in the lane. The article quoted Mike Heiligenstein, executive director of the mobility authority, as saying that the point of the fluctuating tolls is to keep the speeds in each express lane at 50 mph or more. While there are no MoPac toll lanes yet, construction could start as early as 2013, according to an April 2, 2012, Statesman news article. The project is expected to receive final environmental clearance from the federal government around August 2012, which would trigger a six-month period in which approval can be challenged in court. We wondered how Leffingwell factored into the toll-lane plan. Shea told us that she was referring to three votes Leffingwell cast in 2010 as a board member for the Capital Area Metropolitan Planning Organization. That’s a regional body whose primary jobs, according to its website, are to coordinate regional transportation planning and to approve the use of federal transportation funds within the region. The 19-member CAMPO board is made up mostly of local elected officials from Travis, Williamson, Hays, Bastrop and Caldwell counties. CAMPO director Maureen McCoy told us that Leffingwell, who was elected mayor in 2009 and was a council member before that, joined the board in 2008. To back up her claim, Shea sent us copies of the minutes of CAMPO board meetings that struck us as showing that Leffingwell did vote for toll lanes on MoPac. Let’s look closer: ** Vote No. 1: On May 24, 2010, the board voted to adopt Central Texas’ 25-year transportation plan, with Leffingwell and 16 others voting "aye." The plan, which is required under federal law, undergoes a top-to-bottom rewrite every five years. Any road or transit project that uses federal money, as most of them do, must be in the plan to qualify for that money. A May 10, 2010, Statesman news article previewing the vote said the proposed CAMPO 2035 plan contained several hundred road, rail, bicycle and pedestrian projects projected to cost nearly $30 billion. It noted that in the plan was $392 million for a new "managed lane" in each direction on MoPac from Parmer Lane in North Austin to Slaughter Lane in South Austin. The plan that the board approved in May 2010 includes the MoPac "managed lanes" project in its "priority project list." And a separate chart in the plan lists the MoPac project in a section labeled "toll roads and toll express lanes." Several months after the vote, in July 2010, state and local officials announced that the proposed MoPac project, with express toll lanes between Parmer Lane and the river, was moving forward after delays of several years, according to a July 8, 2010, Statesman news article. ** Vote No. 2: On Aug. 9, 2010, the CAMPO board voted to adopt the 2011-2014 Transportation Improvement Program, a short-term document that designates projects to be carried out over the next four years and how they will be funded. (Shea erred slightly in the debate by describing it as a three-year document.) Leffingwell was among the 16 board members who voted for the plan, which included the "managed lanes" project for MoPac between Parmer Lane and the river. In a telephone interview, we asked McCoy, the CAMPO director, whether she considered Leffingwell’s 2010 votes for the long-range plan and the TIP as votes to add a toll lane to MoPac. She said yes, saying that the projects had been discussed for some time. ** Vote No. 3: On Sept. 13, 2010, the board voted 13-4, with Leffingwell’s support, to approve the "terms and conditions" for the MoPac express lane project, as required by state law. According to a summary in the agenda for that meeting, the "terms and conditions," developed by the mobility authority and TxDOT, establish that the project would add an express lane in the Parmer-to-the-river stretch of MoPac "consistent with the CAMPO 2035 Regional Transportation Plan and the current Transportation Improvement Program." They also establish that the toll rate for the project would be "variable based on traffic demand with a minimum rate of 22 cents per mile" and that emergency, military and transit vehicles would be exempt. Finally, it notes that the toll rates would increase annually based on the "Consumer Price Index for Urban Areas." As we closed out this review, Andy Mormon, Leffingwell’s city chief of staff, said in a telephone interview that to describe the MoPac project’s "managed lanes" as "toll lanes" oversimplifies a complex traffic solution project. He also suggested that Shea’s claim leaves out critical context in that under the regional plan, drivers could continue using MoPac without paying tolls. "When you say toll lane in Austin, there’s a lot of people who get up in arms," he said. Our ruling During the debate, Shea responded to Leffingwell’s description of the plan to add a managed lane to each side of a stretch of MoPac by calling it a toll lane and saying Leffingwell had voted for it in a transportation plan. Our conclusion is that except for a select few kinds of motorists, drivers who use the new lanes would have to pay varying tolls. And Leffingwell voted for this approach thrice. Shea did not say MoPac would be entirely tolled. Her comment had the context already given at the debate by the mayor. We rate her claim True.

pomt-10488	"Hillary (Clinton), one time late at night when she was exhausted, misstated and immediately apologized for it, what happened to her in Bosnia in 1995."	pants on fire!	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/apr/11/bill-clinton/not-at-night-not-one-time-not-/	(Published April 11, 2008) Bill Clinton has been stumping nonstop for his wife, touting her accomplishments and defending her. But the former president at times appears to be marching to his own drummer. At a campaign stop on April 10, 2008, in Boonville, Ind., he mused on Hillary Clinton's false account of facing sniper fire on a trip to Bosnia, an incident the candidate would surely prefer to put behind her. And in defending her error, he made even more misstatements of his own. As reported by NBC News' Mike Memoli, Bill Clinton said: "A lot of the way this whole campaign has been covered has amused me. But there was a lot of fulminating because Hillary, one time late at night when she was exhausted, misstated and immediately apologized for it, what happened to her in Bosnia in 1995. Did y'all see all that? Oh, they blew it up." There are several factual errors here; let's take them one at a time. First, it was not "late at night." Hillary Clinton made the remarks that got her in trouble on March 17, 2008, before a speech on Iraq when she reminisced about her trip to Bosnia as first lady: "I remember landing under sniper fire. There was supposed to be some kind of a greeting ceremony at the airport, but instead we just ran with our heads down to get into the vehicles to get to our base." The speech was scheduled for 9 a.m. The campaign Web site shows that she begins the speech with, "Good morning." She also didn't make the remark one time. She said it previously on the campaign trail in Iowa. The Des Moines Register reported her saying on Dec. 30, 2007, "We landed in one of those corkscrew landings and ran out because they said there might be sniper fire. I don't remember anyone offering me tea on the tarmac there." She also didn't apologize "immediately." She said she misspoke a week later, after the video showing her landing in a calm, orderly fashion had circulated on the Internet and news stories were written about it. Finally, the trip took place in 1996, not 1995. We asked the Clinton campaign about Bill's comments. "Senator Clinton appreciates her husband standing up for her, but this was her mistake and she takes responsibility for it," said a campaign spokesman. In making her case for president, Clinton has regularly pointed to her expertise in foreign policy, noting that she visited more than 80 countries while she was first lady. It's true that she visited a lot of countries, and many of those visits were more substantive than critics want to admit. ( See our story documenting her travels here .) But we found she also embellished her accomplishments to the point of factual inaccuracy. We found her statements about China and Northern Ireland to be Half-True , her statement on Kosovo refugees to be Barely True , and her statement on Bosnia to be Pants on Fire wrong. Bill Clinton has implied that the media is biased and covers his wife too harshly. In Boonville, he seemed to lament that unfairness by warning, "And some of them, when they're 60, they'll forget something when they're tired at 11 at night, too." It seems bizarre that the former president would defend his wife's misstatements with even more of his own, but that appears to be the case. We find his rewriting of campaign history to merit his very own Pants on Fire ruling.	None	Bill Clinton	None	None	None	2008-04-11T00:00:00	2008-04-10	['Bill_Clinton']
pomt-08886	Says the director of NASA says its main mission is Muslim outreach.	half-true	/texas/statements/2010/aug/01/michael-sullivan/michael-sullivan-says-nasa-administrator-said-main/	Texas activist Michael Sullivan spiced a July 19 Twitter post on the 41st anniversary of Apollo 11 entering lunar orbit by adding: "NASA dir says main mission is Muslim outreach." America's space agency shifts its gaze from the final frontier to Mecca; who knew? Sullivan, president and ceo of Empower Texans, which describes itself as a pro free-market group, replied to our inquiry with several Web links including one to a July 6 post on FoxNews.com stating NASA Administrator and former astronaut Charles Bolden stressed reaching out to the Muslim world in a June interview. The post says: "Bolden created a firestorm after telling Al Jazeera last month that President (Barack) Obama told him before he took the job that he wanted him to do three things: inspire children to learn math and science, expand international relationships and ‘perhaps foremost, he wanted me to find a way to reach out to the Muslim world and engage much more with dominantly Muslim nations to help them feel good about their historic contribution to science ... and math and engineering.’" The post continues: "Officials from the White House and NASA on Tuesday stood by Bolden's statement that part of his mission is to improve relations with Muslim countries -- though NASA backed off the claim that such international diplomacy is Bolden's ‘foremost’ responsibility." Again, FoxNews: "Bob Jacobs, NASA's assistant administrator for public affairs, …said that Bolden was speaking of priorities when it came to ‘outreach’ and not about NASA's primary missions of ‘science, aeronautics and space exploration.’ He said the ‘core mission’ is exploration and that it was unfortunate Bolden's comments are now being viewed through a ‘partisan prism.’" About a week later, The Washington Post quoted White House spokesman Robert Gibbs saying Bolden wasn't expected to reach out to the Muslim world. "That was not his task," a July 12 blog on the newpaper's site quotes Gibbs saying, "and that's not the task of NASA." Gibbs also is quoted saying White House officials had since spoken to Bolden and NASA about his comments. Also shared by Sullivan: A July 15 blog post by InformationWeek, a business technology site, stating that in June, Bolden visited Qatar and Egypt, "saying that the countries would collaborate with the United States in the future on science and technology programs, noting global education initiatives sponsored by NASA, and saying that NASA was looking to Egyptian scientists to help analyze astrophysics data. This is all part of a larger Obama administration effort, announced last June in Cairo by the president himself, to change U.S. relations with the Muslim world through outreach and cooperation," the post states. We launched our own review, first confirming that Bolden made his statement about Obama’s expectations, according to Al Jazeera’s video post of the interview, which aired June 30. Asked why he's in the Middle East, Bolden replies that he was there around the anniversary of President Obama's 2009 speech in Cairo vowing a new beginning in U.S. relations with the Muslim world. Bolden next lists the "three things" he says Obama charged him to do, including, "perhaps foremost," engaging much more with dominantly Muslim nations and getting "more people who can contribute to the things that we do," citing as past examples Russian and Japanese contributions to the International Space Station. "There is much to be gained by drawing in the contributions that are possible from the Muslim nations," he says. But the interview covers more ground. The four-time visitor to outer space defends his decision to focus NASA on international exploration of deep space plus his desire to use robots to deflect incoming asteroids away from Earth. Bolden said if an asteroid made of metal struck Earth, it could cause another Ice Age: "Instead of the extinction of the dinosaurs, it would be the extinction of human man." (Talk about a missed tweet.) Next, we contacted NASA. Spokesman Michael Cabbage said in an e-mail: "NASA’s core mission remains one of space exploration, science and aeronautics. Administrator Bolden regrets that a statement he made during a recent interview mischaracterized that core mission. The success of NASA’s efforts is increasingly enhanced by mutual cooperation with dozens of other countries around the world that are also committed to these efforts." Does Sullivan's Twitter post make a successful landing? Bolden said the president encouraged him to "find a way to reach out to the Muslim world" -- a goal he described as "perhaps foremost." But it was mentioned in the same context as other goals -- inspiring kids, expanding international relationships -- suggesting Bolden was speaking not about NASA's obvious scientific purpose, but other activities. The focus on space is clear in the video of the Al Jazeera interview. Sullivan's tweet says Bolden said NASA’s "main mission is Muslim outreach." That's akin to saying the agency is deserting outer space to concentrate on residents of the Nile Delta, which would be unbelievable. That said, Bolden acknowledged to PolitiFact that he mischaracterized the agency's main mission in the remark about Obama charging him to do three things. That is, he said something close to what Sullivan said he said — and wishes he hadn't. We rate Sullivan’s statement Half True.

pomt-04575	"Bill Nelson voted for a ban on millions of commonly owned firearms, which included many popular hunting and target rifles."	false	/florida/statements/2012/sep/25/national-rifle-association/nra-attacks-bill-nelsons-vote-gun-ban/	A National Rifle Association website fires several shots at U.S. Sen. Bill Nelson’s voting record. The NRA has given an "F" to Nelson and an "A" to his opponent U.S. Rep. Connie Mack IV, R-Fort Myers. One of the attacks on the website says: "Bill Nelson voted for a ban on millions of commonly owned firearms, which included many popular hunting and target rifles." In this fact-check, we wanted to explore if the NRA accurately described Nelson’s vote on a gun ban. The attack relates to a 2004 vote Nelson took in favor of extending the assault weapons ban of 1994. The vote to extend it came in the form of an amendment that passed the Senate 52-47 on March 2, 2004. The amendment was to a bill to prohibit civil lawsuits from being brought against gun manufacturers and distributors for damages from misuse of firearms. The overall bill overwhelmingly was defeated 8-90 with Nelson voting "no" in the majority -- so that meant the effort to extend the ban also failed. But did the assault weapons ban that Nelson wanted extend to millions of commonly owned firearms, including those used by hunters? Clinton signed assault weapons ban in 1994 The original assault weapons ban of 1994 prohibited the manufacture or possession of semiautomatic assault weapons and banned guns that had two listed military-style features. The law only applied to newly manufactured weapons, grandfathering in millions of guns. The bill also contained a list of more than 600 hunting or sporting shotguns or rifles that remained legal. The law expired in 2004 after attempts in Congress to renew it failed. The Violence Policy Center warned that simply renewing the ban wouldn’t be enough, because manufacturers found ways around the law by making some cosmetic changes to create "after-ban" models. The NRA declined our request to provide documentation to support their claim that the law resulted in a ban on millions of commonly owned firearms including popular hunting firearms. But the NRA did provide some documentation to PolitiFact Wisconsin that fact-checked an NRA radio ad attacking Democrat Tom Barrett, who ultimately lost his recall challenge against Republican Gov. Scott Walker. The NRA said when Barrett was in Congress, he "voted to ban 15 different kinds of guns, even a lot of common deer rifles." PolitiFact Wisconsin ruled that claim Mostly False. The NRA cited newspaper and magazine articles from the late 1980s and early 1990s. The articles showed that some deer hunters used weapons targeted by the ban, but the articles were largely anecdotal and deer hunting experts said the banned weapons were not commonly used for deer hunting when the ban became law in 1994. ATF data and experts on the ban Data from the federal bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms about the number of guns manufactured in the U.S showed a drop during the lifetime of the ban from about 5.1 million in 1994 to 3.1 million in 2004. (Years after the ban expired, it soared to about 5.5 million in 2010.) But the ATF doesn’t have categories for guns by their intended use (for hunting versus crime, for example) but instead shows it by pistols, revolvers, rifles, shotguns and a smaller category for miscellaneous. During the ban the number of manufactured pistols, revolvers and shotguns dropped considerably while the number of rifles increased slightly. The other research we found focused on the impact on crime or the availability of assault weapons -- not about the impact for hunters. We interviewed experts about the assault weapons ban including Daniel Vice, an attorney at the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence and Kristen Rand, Legislative Director for the Violence Policy Center -- two groups that fight gun violence and are often on the opposite side of the NRA. (When the assault ban came up for renewal, the Brady Center supported continuing it, while the VPC argued that the ban was flawed and didn’t go far enough.) We also interviewed Christopher S. Koper, an associate professor at George Mason University. All three of our experts disagreed with the NRA’s claim. Since Nelson’s 2004 vote was simply to extend the ban, it couldn’t have banned "millions of commonly owned firearms" as the NRA claimed, Vice said in an email. The 1994 ban "only banned the sale or possession of newly manufactured guns," not guns already owned by people. Also, the ban specifically exempted hundreds of hunting weapons by name, Vice said. Koper, the professor who wrote a report about the ban for the DOJ, said that the NRA’s claim is misleading. The purpose of the ban was to restrict weapons with multiple military-style features which were less appropriate for hunting purposes. And the list of hundreds of firearms that were exempted, "were deemed to be more appropriate for hunting." Also, gun manufacturers continued to make weapons very similar to the banned weapons by removing some or all of the military-style features, allowing sport shooters to get similar substitutes in many cases. Nelson’s response Nelson has long supported a ban on assault weapons, including while in Congress in the 1980s. In 1990, when he was running for governor, Nelson made his call for a state assault weapons ban a focus of his campaign even as he said he still supported gun rights. "I'm for the constitutional right to bear arms," Nelson said then. "I'm a hunter and so is my son." But Nelson said youngsters were taking submachine guns to school, and Colombian drug lords were buying their weapons in Florida. At campaign stops in 1990, Nelson waved an AK-47 over his head and said that a campaign aide was able to buy buy an AK-47 semiautomatic rifle in less than 10 minutes at a Miami gun store. A spokesman for Nelson’s Senate office, Bryan Gulley, cited some more recent examples of Nelson’s pro-gun votes: He voted for an amendment to permit Amtrak passengers to transport guns in checked baggage and for an amendment to allow individuals to possess firearms in the national parks in 2009. Our ruling The NRA said that "Bill Nelson voted for a ban on millions of commonly owned firearms, which included many popular hunting and target rifles." In 2004, Nelson voted to extend the 1994 assault weapons ban. Yes, some hunters used the types of firearms that were then banned. But the ban applied to newly manufactured weapons, and gun makers quickly found ways to tweak banned guns to create "after ban" guns. Hunters or sportsmen still had plenty of choices -- literally hundreds since the ban explicitly listed more than 600 weapons used for hunting that remained legal. We rate this claim False.

pomt-04634	Tennessee's appeals court judges "were selected by a handful of party officials in Nashville" before the system of "merit selection" was put into effect.	mostly true	/tennessee/statements/2012/sep/14/paul-summers/summers-says-appeals-court-judges-used-be-picked-h/	Paul Summers, who served as Tennessee's attorney general from 1999 through 2006, re-entered debate over how the state should select its top judges recently with an opinion article provided to newspapers that advocates continuation of the present system. While we don't argue with opinions, in the course of stating his case for the present "merit selection" of appellate court judges Summers made an assertion of fact that may be of interest as debate escalates toward decision-making time in the Legislature next year. Summers' piece, as published in the News Sentinel, begins with the adage that, "If you do not know history, you are bound to repeat it." A bit further down, he states: "Back when we had partisan elections for the judges of the appellate courts, they were in theory elected by hundreds of thousands of Tennesseans. In truth, they were selected by a handful of party officials in Nashville in January every eight years." Along the same lines: "Proponents of popular elections say that a handful of politicians should not be selecting our highest 29 judges. They say the people ought to decide. Apparently they aren't aware, or just ignore, the fact that a handful of politicians selected the appellate judges before merit selection became law in 1971." Does Summers have his history right? Asked to elaborate, Summers, the son of an appeals court judge, said in an interview that he had in mind relatively recent history and especially the process for selecting state Supreme Court judges. A bit of longer-term history may be in order, largely based on "A History of the Tennessee Supreme Court",published by the University of Tennessee Press in 2002. The book covers the period 1776-1998 From statehood until 1854, the state Legislature appointed Tennessee's top judges. In the latter year, voters approved a constitutional amendment – initiated in the Legislature a year earlier – providing instead for popular election. That remained the case until 1971, when the General Assembly approved a statute – not a constitutional amendment – setting up what was called the "Modified Missouri Plan." The system calls for prospective judges to be screened by a commission, which then submits a list of names of the persons deemed best qualified to the governor. The governor then appoints the judge of his choice. But two years later, with Republican Gov. Winfield Dunn in office and positioned to make appointments, the Democrat-controlled General Assembly repealed the new law insofar as applying to Supreme Court justices. It was left in effect for judges of the Court of Appeals and Court of Criminal Appeals. In 1994, the General Assembly voted – again by enacting a statute – to put the Supreme Court back under the commission nominating/gubernatorial appointment process, making a few other relatively minor changes and calling the procedure "the Tennessee plan." Under the plan, when a judge's term ends after an appointment, he or she goes up for reelection on a yes-no basis. If a majority of voters statewide say yes in the "retention election," the judge gets a new term. Today, the Tennessee Plan is still in effect – but possibly not for long. The Judicial Nominating Commission, which submits names to the governor, will cease to exist on June 30, 2013, unless the Legislature votes to extend its life before then. This comes with all appellate judge positions coming up in the eight-year cycle for a retention election cycle in August 2014. There are conflicting proposals – ranging from a constitutional amendment for a revised system to a return to contested elections – about what the Legislature should do next year. While the future of Tennessee judge selection is muddled, hindsight can be fairly clear. Summers says that, in writing his article, the standout case of judge selection by a "handful of politicians" came in 1990, when the state Democratic Party's 66-member Executive Committee chose a slate of five Supreme Court candidates for the party nomination. Early in that year, two of the five incumbent Supreme Court justices stepped aside, reportedly after failing to gather enough political support among party activists on the Democratic Executive Committee. The Democratic nominees wound up being the only candidates on the ballot and were elected to full eight-year terms. That was clearly a case where, as Summers states, a majority of the committee – 34 of the 66 members, or a "handful of party officials" if you will – was able to choose Supreme Court justices. But that was not always the case when partisan, contested elections were part of the picture. Eight years before the 1990 scenario, the Republican party in 1982 put up a slate of three party nominees chosen by the Republican Executive Committee. The Democrats won in all the races. In 1980, following the death of a sitting justice, then-Gov. Lamar Alexander appointed appointed George H. Brown of Memphis as Tennessee's first black member of the court. That set up a special election later in the year between Brown, as the Republican nominee, and the Democratic Executive Committee's nominee, Frank Drowota, and independent candidate Larry Parrish of Memphis, known as an anti-pornography crusader. Drowota won with 50 percent of the vote versus 38 percent for Brown and 12 percent for Parrish. Brown was one of the GOP nominees in the 1982 race, too. There had also been a contested Supreme Court election in 1974, when Republicans nominated candidates for all five positions. They all lost. With Democrats dominating the state, Republicans had apparently stopped trying in 1990. In today's political environment, Summers suggests that the Republican Executive Committee will pick the Supreme Court if there is a return to partisan elections. Summers also pointed out to us a speech by C.S. Carneyto the 1977 Tennessee Constitutional Convention, which drafted a constitutional amendment on judicial selection subsequently rejected by the voters. Carney had served as a Court of Appeals judge under the old system and won back his seat under the retention election system instituted in 1971. In the speech, Carney criticized the partisan election system, saying it was dependent on political favor and not ability. Relative to this discussion, he also said there had been no exceptions to the rule of the Democratic Executive Committee picking Supreme Court justices since 1910. In that year, though, there was an extraordinarily contested election. The Supreme Court had upheld a controversial murder conviction, only to have Gov. Malcolm Patterson pardon the killer. The ensuing uproar led to a split in Democratic ranks and qualifying a slate of "independent" Supreme Court candidates – and some for other appellate courts as well - backed by the splinter Democrats and Republicans. The independents won every seat and the related turmoil is widely credited as well for the election of a Republican, Ben Hooper, as governor. He was the last Republican to hold the office until Dunn, whose election led to enactment of the "Modified Missouri plan" in 1971. It appears then, that appellate court were mostly selected by a relatively small number of politicians when the partisan election system was in place. But not always. In 1910, in the 1970s and in the 1980s, top judicial elections were decided by voters who had a choice to override the decisions of that handful of politicians. So the voters ultimately decided in those cases, not the nominating committee. Still, that leaves party powers giving voters no choice from the years after Reconstruction – during which the judges were appointed by governors under federal oversight – up until 1910. And then again until the 1970s, as best we can tell. That leaves us viewing Summers statement as Mostly True.

pomt-06635	"I asked the unions to pay into their own health care insurance ... and they said I was being unreasonable. I requested that they contribute toward their own pensions ... and they screamed it was unfair."	mostly false	/wisconsin/statements/2011/sep/16/scott-walker/gov-scott-walker-says-he-asked-unions-concessions-/	In a September 2011 campaign fundraising letter pegged to staving off a possible recall drive against him, Gov. Scott Walker mocked his opponents as the "old order" and "screaming protesters" blocking bold fiscal reforms. He focused sharply on labor unions, which fought legislation by Walker and Republican lawmakers to curtail collective bargaining and force public workers to contribute more toward pensions and health care. That push, which became law, attracted massive and prolonged protests in Madison. "I asked the unions to pay into their own health care insurance (just as their Wisconsin neighbors do) and they said I was being unreasonable," Walker’s letter said. "I requested that they contribute toward their own pensions (just as their Wisconsin neighbors do) and they screamed it was unfair." He added: "Obviously I made the protectors of the status quo boiling mad." Walker’s claim gets at one of the key rhetorical battles left over from the historic budget fight in Madison. Walker supporters argue it was really always about the money and that’s why organized labor fought so fiercely against Walker’s plan. Union leaders say their beef was with Walker’s sharp limits on collective bargaining and what that would mean for the future of unions. Indeed, in the heat of the standoff -- with Senate Democrats delaying action by fleeing to Illinois -- leaders of major unions proclaimed they’d accept the pension and health-insurance benefit changes if the bargaining changes were dropped. So, what about Walker’s statement -- that he had requested that change, but it was rejected as unreasonable and unfair? We’ll examine three distinct periods -- the governor’s race of 2010, the post-election period before Walker took office, and Walker’s early months as governor starting in January 2011. The timing matters. In mid-February 2011, labor was reeling over Walker’s newly announced plans to impose benefits cuts and curtail collective bargaining for most public employees. It was at that point that AFSCME Council 24 (the largest state employee union), along with the state teachers union and other labor leaders said they would be willing to trade the concessions if Walker would drop the limits on collective bargaining. AFSCME stands for American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees. To be sure, not all members or unions fell in lockstep behind their leaders’ stance. In fact, on March 3 some 7,000 unionists held a "no concessions, no cuts" rally in Madison organized by National Nurses United. And the rally was officially backed by several major public sector unions in Wisconsin. Walker rejected the offer as a "hope and a prayer" and said the collective bargaining limits were also crucial to giving local government and schools the flexibility needed to balance their budgets. Unions then pointed to Walker’s reaction as proof he just wanted to gut unions. Given this whole sequence, can the governor claim unions rejected his request? That’s where the timing comes in. When we asked Walker aides for backup for the claim, they pointed us to the reactions of AFSCME Council 24 leader Martin Beil in December 2010 -- when Walker, then the governor-elect, began rolling out details of his push for benefits concessions -- and even further back, to summer 2010, when Walker aired a campaign TV ad on the theme. At the earlier points, the union had a much different reaction -- to say the least. We’ll focus on Beil’s AFSCME unit because it represents 22,000 state workers and took the public lead in reacting to Walker. Here’s a look at the sequence: June 2010: Walker, then a candidate in the GOP primary, said he would propose major wage and benefit cuts from state employees to help close a huge projected budget shortfall. Reaction: Beil’s union said Walker was propagating a myth that state workers were overpaid. "State employees for many years have taken less money in wages so they could have solid pensions that could be there when they retired. Now you've got characters like Walker saying 'We've got to violate that trust,'" Beil said. "It would be very difficult for us to easily accept this at the bargaining table." November 2010: With the election won, Walker lobbied Gov. Jim Doyle to stop negotiating labor deals on his way out of office. (The tentative agreements included no pay increases and unpaid furlough days that equalled a 3.3 percent pay cut for workers. They called for small increases in employee health premium contributions that were considerably less that Walker later sought.) Reaction: On Dec. 2, 2010 Beil told Wisconsin Eye, "What more is there? Does he want our firstborn?" If Walker wants benefit cuts, Beil said, he should give wage hikes in return. In that interview he said it could "get ugly," echoing comments he made in a Nov. 16, 2010 interview on Wisconsin Public Television: "Workers have ability to withhold labor, whether it’s legal or illegal…If pushed I believe state employees will respond by taking matters to the street." December 2010: While the lame-duck Legislature considered the Doyle-negotiated union deals, Walker upped the ante. He made clear he was considering abolishing public unions altogether -- or at least changing state law so he didn’t have to bargain with them -- in order to get more from employees on pensions and health without negotiations that could drag on. Public employees have become "haves" and taxpayers "have nots," Walker said. Reaction: "State workers and other public workers aren't about to sacrifice their benefits for some political future of a tyrant," Beil said. "This is all about Scott Walker kind of bringing back, instead of public service, it is public servitude. He's the master of the plantation and we're supposed to be his slaves; that's his philosophy here. So I think he'd be real happy if we were paid minimum wage and had no pension at all." Later, on the eve of Walker’s inauguration, Beil’s union put out a fact sheet making the case that workers were not overcompensated. This is a crucial point in time, because union critics often cite the "plantation/slave" remarks as the high point of union resistance to monetary concessions. And this is where evaluating Walker’s recent claim gets interesting. It’s clear that the biggest state employees’ union reacted negatively -- from the start -- to Walker’s push for concessions on health insurance and pensions. But during the time period Walker pointed us to, after the election, it’s also clear that union leaders were reacting at least in part to Walker’s suggestions that he might bypass union negotiations to get what he wanted. Beil’s much-quoted "slaves" remarks, for example, came a few days after Walker said he might even act to eliminate the unions altogether. Beil complained that Walker was simply "issuing mandates." There are other problems with Walker’s claim. In his fundraising letter, Walker painted himself as having "asked" or "requested" the benefits concessions. A reader unfamiliar with the history might think the governor made an actual offer to the unions in collective bargaining. Or that some talks between the two sides took place. No such offer was ever made, and there is no evidence of behind-the-scenes talks, according to both sides. Walker certainly signalled through his public statements that he would seek the concessions, but ultimately -- when it came time to deal with labor -- he chose to end-run the unions and 50 years of collective bargaining history and unveil legislation removing pensions and health insurance from negotiations. So Walker didn’t "ask" -- he told. Was there ever room to bargain? In late 2010 when labor dealt with union-friendly Doyle, a Democrat, unions agreed to no wage increase, furloughs and modest increases in payments toward health benefits -- in exchange for more say on overtime and other matters. When Walker did put the concessions into the budget-repair bill in February 2011, it was scheduled to come to a vote within a week. Negotiations were a moot point. The unions reacted by going public with statements offering to give Walker what he wanted on pensions and health if he would back off the collective bargaining limits. But it’s impossible to know how serious the offer was, or what would have happened if Walker decided to take it. Our ruling In a fundraising letter, Walker stated unions had rejected his push to pay more for pensions and health care. The immediate reaction from labor was negative -- when Walker unveiled his plan in February 2011 but also when he broached the idea during the campaign and advanced it in the period before he took office. But, soon after his concessions proposal was introduced, top labor leaders quickly said they could swallow the higher pension and health care contributions if Walker backed down on collective bargaining. What’s more, the portrayal of "asking" the unions rewrites history, leaving the misleading impression there was give and take with labor. Walker’s office argued that the union statements and actions amounted to a refusal. But by that standard, later statements from those same leaders bowing to concessions would have to be taken into account as acceptance. We rate the statement Mostly False.

pomt-15107	Says the case of a Texas judge who refused to perform heterosexual weddings exposes a double standard in the case against Kentucky clerk Kim Davis.	false	/punditfact/statements/2015/sep/14/viral-image/conservative-facebook-post-faults-lesbian-texas-ju/	Kentucky clerk Kim Davis is back on the job. The Rowan County official drew an ardent following when she refused to issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples. She also spent a few days in jail for failing to follow a U.S. Supreme Court ruling legalizing such unions. This prompted a group on Facebook called Conservative News Today to post an interesting comparison. "Lesbian judge Tonya Parker refused to perform heterosexual marriages for three years. Never reprimanded. "Christian clerk Kim Davis obeys Kentucky law and U.S. constitution. Gets thrown in jail." Here’s the image shared by at least 59,000 people: Set aside the accuracy of the statement that Davis obeyed the law. (The U.S. Supreme Court does have the final word on constitutional issues.) At the heart of this post is the claim that the case of a Texas judge who refused to perform heterosexual weddings exposes a double standard in the case against Kentucky clerk Kim Davis. That comparison falls wide of the facts. Judge Tonya Parker Parker was elected to the 116th Judicial District Court of Texas in 2010. She was the first openly homosexual person elected to a judgeship in Dallas County, and in 2012, she said in a speech that she was refusing to perform marriage ceremonies until same-sex couples gained the same rights as their opposite-sex counterparts. "I don't perform marriage ceremonies because we are in a state that does not have marriage equality and until it does, I'm not going to partially apply the law to one group of people that doesn't apply to another group of people," Parker told a meeting of the Stonewall Democrats of Dallas. Parker later explained in an email to news organizations that "I do not, and would never, impede any person's right to get married." She simply declined to conduct marriage ceremonies herself. Given that at that time, the only legal marriages in Texas were between opposite-sex couples, de facto, Parker was refusing to marry heterosexuals. We should note that she didn’t single out such couples. They were the only ones she had the opportunity not to officiate over. According to news reports, Parker faced no official sanctions as a result of her policy. Does that put her in the same boat as Davis? No. Judges and clerks play different roles The side-by-side comparison treats judges and clerks as if they play the same role in the marriage process. That's not true. While it is the responsibility of clerks to issue marriage licenses, judges do not share that obligation. Generally speaking, judges don’t marry people, said Alexandra Albright, who teaches Texas civil procedure at the University of Texas at Austin Law School. "They can perform marriages in Texas, but it’s not their job," Albright said. "Most judges I know marry people they know. It’s a thing they do for friends." Albright said a judge like Parker is expected to spend her time presiding over lawsuits brought before her. When it comes to marriage ceremonies, the Texas code authorizes a range of people to officiate. The list includes clergy, a designated officer of any religious organization, a variety of judges, justices of the peace, and retired judges and justices of the peace. In contrast, a clerk like Davis holds a unique gatekeeper position in the marriage process. "You can’t get married without a marriage license," Albright said. "There all kinds of people who can perform wedding ceremonies." Our ruling A conservative group on Facebook said the case of a Texas judge who refused to perform heterosexual weddings exposes a double standard in the case against Kentucky clerk Kim Davis. The comparison fails because a judge in Texas and a clerk in Kentucky play different official roles in the marriage process. Texas law authorizes many people, including judges, to perform marriages. Doing so is optional. In Kentucky, couples must have a marriage license issued by a clerk to get married. Davis’ refusal shut the door on marriage for same-sex couples, at least in her county.

The post cites a National Hurricane Center storm projection from Sept. 1, 2017.

Forecasters expect the storm to reach South Florida by Sept. 9. Florida Gov. Rick Scott declared a state of emergency on Sept. 4.

pomt-06327	President Barack Obama, Nancy Pelosi and Harry Reid support Rick Perry’s "decision to give in-state tuition to illegal immigrants."	mostly false	/texas/statements/2011/nov/10/mitt-romney/romney-video-claims-democratic-leaders-agree-perry/	To ominous background music, a video posted online by Mitt Romney’s campaign opens with a narrator asking, "Who supports Gov. (Rick) Perry’s decision to give in-state tuition to illegal immigrants?" Next, photographs of President Barack Obama, U.S. House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi of California and Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid of Nevada appear onscreen, one after the other. That’s followed by a November 2003 video clip of Vicente Fox, Mexico’s president at the time, thanking Perry for Texas’ 2001 law enabling some illegal immigrants to pay in-state tuition at the state’s public colleges and universities. Fox’s thanks, which were videotaped by C-SPAN, were offered during a visit to Austin. That moment aside, we wondered if Romney, the former Massachusetts governor vying with Perry and others for the 2012 Republican presidential nomination, was correct in saying that the three Democratic leaders support Perry’s action. This fall, Romney and other candidates have hammered Perry for the Texas law, which Perry has defended as giving solid students opportunities not to be drags on society. Also, Perry has accurately noted that the proposal cleared the Texas House and Senate with minimal opposition. Under the Texas law, undocumented immigrants with a Texas high school diploma or GED who have lived in Texas for at least three years can qualify for in-state tuition if they sign an affidavit saying they intend to apply for permanent residency as soon as they can. We asked Romney’s campaign staff for backup on the Sept. 29, 2011, video’s claims. Spokesman Ryan Williams pointed us to news stories and government web pages showing Obama, Pelosi and Reid backing versions of the proposed federal DREAM Act, which would provide a pathway to citizenship for illegal immigrants who were brought to the United States as children, if they attend college or serve in the military. We’ll explore the DREAM Act aspect in a moment. First, we wondered whether any of the Democratic leaders have spoken explicitly about the Texas law. Romney’s material offered nothing specific about that, though it noted that as a member of the Illinois Senate, Obama co-sponsored legislation to allow undocumented immigrant students to pay in-state tuition at public colleges and universities. That measure became law in 2003. Like the Texas law, the Illinois act requires benefiting students to have a high school diploma or GED from an institution in the state and to sign affidavits swearing to apply for permanent legal residency. Texas requires students to have lived in the state for three years prior to receiving a diploma/GED while Illinois requires that the students attended school in-state for the three years before they received a diploma/GED. According to legislative records, Obama was one of 26 senators listed as co-sponsors of the proposal. He does not appear to have been a key advocate; none of 40 news items that we found published on the measure in 2002-03 mentions him. In interviews and by email, aides for Pelosi, Reid and Obama each said their boss had not spoken about the Texas law. We found no news accounts showing otherwise. More broadly, news reports yielded no flat endorsements by the Democratic leaders of state laws allowing in-state tuition for illegal immigrants, yet also no indications that any of the three object. During a 2007 visit to Arizona, Pelosi made what the Arizona Republic described as a "reference to the effect of" a state law barring illegal immigrants from getting in-state tuition rates. The paper’s Feb. 20, 2007, news story says Pelosi described meeting a prospective student who could not prove she was a legal U.S. resident and then said: "Our country does not benefit by our depriving young people of an education." Her comment, though, falls short of calling for in-state tuition for illegal immigrants. Asked to clarify Obama’s position on in-state tuition laws, White House spokesman Adam Abrams told us that he has not weighed in on the issue as president. However, Obama recently voiced a sentiment similar to Pelosi’s: Speaking in support of the DREAM Act during a May 10, 2011, address in El Paso, Obama said that "we should stop punishing innocent young people for the actions of their parents. We should stop denying them the chance to earn an education." Reid has used similar words. Romney’s campaign cites a 2007 example in which MSNBC quotes Reid arguing for the DREAM Act: "Children should not be penalized for the actions of their parents." But does the Democrats’ support for the DREAM Act — confirmed by their spokesmen — back up Romney’s claim? Most DREAM Act versions, including those pending before the U.S. House and Senate, would repeal a 1996 federal provision that some people interpret as a ban on states allowing illegal immigrants to qualify for in-state college tuition rates unless everyone legally in the U.S. can get the same benefit. The provision says: "An alien who is not lawfully present in the United States shall not be eligible on the basis of residence within a state (or a political subdivision) for any post-secondary education benefit unless a citizen or national of the United States is eligible for such a benefit (in no less an amount, duration and scope) without regard to whether the citizen or national is such a resident." Our ruling Obama once co-sponsored a measure like the Texas tuition law, giving Romney’s claim a thread of truth. However, none of the Democrats has aired support for Perry’s decision to sign his state’s proposal into law, which is the essence of the claim. We rate Romney’s statement Mostly False.

pomt-12944	"Martin Luther King said our lives begin to end the day we become silent on things that matter."	half-true	/texas/statements/2017/jan/06/dan-patrick/half-true-dan-patrick-martin-luther-king-saying-li/	Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick opened his full-throated endorsement of Texas legislation targeting transgender access to bathrooms by quoting the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. Patrick, joined by the proposal’s author, state Sen. Lois Kolkhorst, told reporters at the Texas Capitol on Jan. 5, 2017: "Martin Luther King said our lives begin to end the day we become silent on things that matter. "This legislation, the Texas Privacy Act, that Sen. Kolkhorst is filing today, is unquestionably one of the things that matters," Patrick said. "It’s the right thing to do. I know it, Texans know it and Sen. Kolkhorst knows it." Debate over the measure--banning transgender people from using the Texas bathroom of their choice--will play out in the 2017 legislative session. We focused on the origin of Patrick’s King quotation. Patrick offers no backup We didn’t hear back from Patrick about when and where the slain civil rights leader made the singled-out statement, which went noted in the Associated Press’s account of Patrick’s remarks and quoted by the Dallas Morning News. For our part, a web search for the quotation and "King" suggested by a professor yielded 2,980 results including books of poetry and documentation that President Clinton similarly quoted King in an April 2000 speech and Sen. Joe Lieberman did so in the Senate in June 2003. So, Patrick was in bipartisan company in crediting the words to King. On the other hand, we were unable to confirm that King made that exact declaration. Also, it’s worth noting, King probably didn’t expound on bathrooms except toward widening access to public facilities. A photo caption We started our look into this topic by trying to gauge if King said the words aired by Patrick. Right off, a web search yielded an undated New York Daily News photo of King giving a speech. The photo caption said: "King was engaged in a battle with Sheriff Jim Clark over voting rights and voter registration in Selma. On March 8, 1965, King spoke from the pulpit on courage: ‘Our lives begin to end the day we become silent about things that matter.’" Stanford researchers can’t confirm Separately, though, King experts either said he likely didn’t make the quoted remark or if he did, it’s hard to confirm so with ease. "That would be a research project," said Clayborne Carson, the Martin Luther King, Jr., Centennial professor of history at Stanford University and director of a research institute in King’s name. By phone, Carson told us that’s because the institute’s resources aren’t yet easily searched for a particular quotation. Put another way, he said by email, it’s "easier to prove what King said on a particular occasion than to prove that he never said the quote in question on any occasion." An institute research assistant, Ellen Ingebritsen, later responded that her search of the project’s internal database and documents culled from the institute's King papers didn’t turn up King making the statement. Then again, she said, the institute has yet to catalogue the majority of King’s work from 1965. Otherwise, she said, King letters and telegrams from that year don’t contain the words attributed to King by Patrick. A similar confirmed King statement Story over? Not quite. Other experts helped us find that King made a similar yet less direct statement in the Brown Chapel in Selma, Ala., on Monday, March 8, 1965--the same date noted in the News’s photo caption and also the day after protesters met police violence after attempting to cross a bridge on the way to Montgomery, the state capital. King, who would shortly lead a crossing of the bridge before turning around, said in part: "A man dies when he refuses to stand up for that which is right. A man dies when he refuses to stand up for justice. A man dies when he refuses to take a stand for that which is true." Here’s King’s remark in context as we found it on an East Tennessee State University web page: "Deep down in our non-violent creed is the conviction there are some things so dear, some things so precious, some things so eternally true, that they're worth dying for. And if a man happens to be 36-years-old, as I happen to be, some great truth stands before the door of his life--some great opportunity to stand up for that which is right. "A man might be afraid his home will get bombed, or he's afraid that he will lose his job, or he's afraid that he will get shot, or beat down by state troopers, and he may go on and live until he's 80. He's just as dead at 36 as he would be at 80. The cessation of breathing in his life is merely the belated announcement of an earlier death of the spirit. He died... "A man dies when he refuses to stand up for that which is right. A man dies when he refuses to stand up for justice. A man dies when he refuses to take a stand for that which is true. "So we're going to stand up amid horses. We're going to stand up right here in Alabama, amid the billy-clubs. We're going to stand up right here in Alabama amid police dogs, if they have them. We're going to stand up amid tear gas! "We're going to stand up amid anything they can muster up, letting the world know that we are determined to be free!" To our inquiry, Doug Burgess, chairman of the university’s history department, said by phone that he posted the excerpt some 15 years ago. Burgess also helped us track down a YouTube video in which we saw King making the remarks, which the video attributes to a Nostalgia Company recording, "The Greatest Speeches of All Time, Volume II." Separately, Carson told us his research took note of a similar King statement made Nov. 5, 1967, at his home church in Atlanta. King, exhorting parishioners to fight for what’s right, said a person’s failure to do so would amount to dying before death. "You died when you refused to stand up for right, you died when you refused to stand up for truth, you died when you refused to stand up for justice," Carson quoted King saying. We also heard back from a King biographer, David Garrow, who said by email that his sense is that King didn’t make the statement aired by Patrick. That "language does *NOT* in any way sound familiar to me as an exact quote," Garrow wrote. "I believe it is INVALID." Garrow summed up: "Your verdict on this ought to be something like 'Unproven, undocumented, & highly doubtful.’" Texas professors: Quotation out of context Asked to assess Patrick’s quotation, University of Texas historians Don Carleton and Paul Stekler each opined that Patrick presented King’s sentiment out of historical context. Stekler, who helped produce, direct and write a documentary on the civil rights movement in 1967-68, said by email that King "was in Selma to try and force federal action to ensure voting rights, a campaign that was successful with the passage of the Voting Rights Act of 1965 in the aftermath of the police riot on the Edmund Pettus Bridge. He was advocating the expansion of rights for African-Americans in the South where they had been and were largely disenfranchised." Patrick, Stekler wrote, employed King’s purported words in support of restricting the rights of transgender people. "One use of the quote uses it in support of the expansion of rights, the other in restricting rights," Stekler said. Our ruling Per Patrick, King said our lives begin to end the day we become silent on things that matter. Patrick didn’t show nor did we confirm that King made this direct statement. Then again, Patrick didn’t specify he was quote-unquote directly quoting King while King in 1965 made a longer proclamation that might later have been paraphrased in the 14 words that Patrick and others including President Clinton ultimately attributed to the civil rights icon.

pomt-11509	Says that "along the southern border of the U.S.," the government apprehends "seven individuals a day who are either known or suspected terrorists."	pants on fire!	/texas/statements/2018/feb/21/mike-pence/pants-fire-mike-pences-claim-about-nabbing-7-terro/	Vice President Mike Pence says terrorists are getting caught at the U.S.-Mexico border day after day. In his Feb. 17, 2018, remarks in Dallas, Pence mentioned his visit the day before to the port inside the Hidalgo-Reynosa International Bridge in Hidalgo, a border town in Texas’ Rio Grande Valley. "We’ve made progress but we still have work to do," Pence said. According to the White House transcript, Pence went on: "I learned yesterday at the Hidalgo border center that along the southern border of the United States, we actually still apprehend 1,100 individuals a day, who are attempting to enter this country illegally, including seven individuals a day who are either known or suspected terrorists." "So men and women, let me say, we’re going to continue to work to secure our borders," Pence said next. "We’re going to reform a broken immigration system. And make no mistake about it, we’re going to build that wall," Pence said to applause. We sought to verify Pence’s declaration that seven suspected or known terrorists are daily getting nabbed at the border. The FBI’s Terrorist Screening Center says in a FAQ last updated in January 2017 that a "known terrorist" is an individual who’s been arrested, charged or convicted in the U.S. or abroad of a crime related to terrorism or terrorist-related activities--or a person identified as a terrorist or member of a terrorist organization "pursuant to statute, executive order, or international legal obligation pursuant to a United Nations Security Council resolution." A suspected terrorist, the FBI says, is an individual reasonably suspected to have engaged in or currently or about to be engaged in conduct constituting, in preparation for, in aid of, or related to terrorism and/or terrorist activities. Total apprehensions in border region We didn’t draw fresh information when we asked the White House about the basis of Pence’s reference to border apprehensions. Separately, Carlos Diaz, a Customs and Border Protection spokesman, suggested that we review that agency’s latest counts of individuals apprehended by the government along the U.S.-Mexico border. In January 2018, the month before Pence spoke, CBP says, 35,822 individuals were apprehended in the Southwest Border region, which takes in the more than 2,000 miles from Brownsville, Texas, to San Diego. That breaks out to 1,155 apprehended people a day. No data for terrorists apprehended at border Best we could tell, though, the statistics pointed out by Diaz don’t include counts of deterred or detained terrorists or suspected terrorists--a judgment shared, when we asked for help, by Alex Nowrestah, an analyst for the Cato Institute, which published a 2016 paper finding that foreign-born terrorists who entered the country, either as immigrants or tourists, were responsible for 88 percent (or 3,024) of the 3,432 murders caused by terrorists on U.S. soil from 1975 through the end of 2015. By email, Nowrestah told us he was unaware of statistics supporting Pence’s seven-a-day statement about the U.S.-Mexico border. Generally, Nowrestah suggested we attempt our own ballpark estimate starting from a Department of Homeland Security table tallying "aliens" apprehended nationally in 2016 (the latest year of compiled data) by countries of origin--putting our focus on the number of individuals stopped from entering from countries that President Donald Trump seeks to bar U.S. visitors. Taking this approach, we found that 211 of the people apprehended in 2016 hailed from Chad, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Syria and Yemen (with no one apprehended from another travel-ban country, North Korea)--less than a person a day. An alternate claim Another expert helped us identify a seven-a-day claim that has factual footing. By email, David Sterman, an analyst with the New America think tank, which has compiled information on terrorist activities in the United States after 9/11, pointed out that in January 2018, the Justice Department and Homeland Security released a report supporting a seven-a-day calculation. A government press release and the report itself each say that in 2017, Homeland Security "had 2,554 encounters with individuals on the terrorist watch list (also known as the FBI’s Terrorist Screening Database) traveling to the United States," which breaks out to seven individuals a day. Pence made such a statement during his visit to Hidalgo, according to a McAllen Monitor news story on his visit. The story quoted the vice president saying: "Homeland Security, I am told, refuses entry to seven known or suspected individuals who may have terrorist intent in this country every day, or roughly 2,500 a year." The 2018 report says: "Where consistent with the law, such individuals are denied entry into the United States, while in some cases law enforcement authorities are notified and can take appropriate action." The report further says: "This data only includes individuals of which the United States encountered and not all of those who may have entered or attempted to enter the country undetected." Most stopped at airports? In Dallas, Pence said the seven daily apprehensions were taking place along the southern border. But in 2017, according to the report, most of the deterred individuals were stopped from entering by airplane--not necessarily at the border. According to the report, of the 2,554 individuals, 335 were attempting to enter by land, 2,170 were attempting to enter by air and 49 were attempting to enter by sea. Also by email, Sterman cautioned that being on a watch list "is not the same as being a terrorism suspect. It’s a vast architecture that includes many names for varying levels of concern. Denying entry is a low bar to clear. Which is part of the reason citing this number to defend the immigration-centric counterterrorism strategy is misleading. It’s more of a sign that a lot is already done." We sought the FBI’s comment on whether people on the watch list consists of known terrorists and suspected terrorists and didn’t immediately hear back. Our ruling Pence said in Dallas that "along the southern border of the U.S.," the government apprehends "seven individuals a day who are either known or suspected terrorists." We found no facts that back up this border-specific tally. Nationally in 2017, the federal government says, Homeland Security stopped 2,554 individuals on its terrorist watch list from entering the country, which breaks out to seven people a day. Most of those individuals tried to enter by air, the government says. We rate Pence’s claim Pants on Fire. PANTS ON FIRE – The statement is not accurate and makes a ridiculous claim.

pomt-13464	Says Donald Trump's foundation "took money other people gave to his charity and then bought a six-foot-tall painting of himself."	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/sep/13/barack-obama/barack-obama-says-trump-foundation-took-other-peop/	President Barack Obama went to Philadelphia on Sept. 13 to campaign for Hillary Clinton, who was recovering from pneumonia. In his speech, Obama didn’t hold back in his critique of Clinton’s opponent, Donald Trump. In one particularly vivid line, Obama took a shot at Trump’s foundation, contrasting it with the Clintons’ foundation, which focuses on improving global health. The Clinton Foundation has been attacked by critics for taking money from donors who might have business before a future President Clinton. But Obama was having none of it. "You want to debate foundations and charities?" Obama said. "One candidate's family foundation has saved countless lives around the world. The other candidate's foundation took money other people gave to his charity and then bought a six-foot-tall painting of himself." Obama added, to laughter, "I mean, you know, he had the taste not to go for the 10-foot version, but…" We have previously written about how the Clinton Foundation helped 9 million people receive lower-cost HIV/AIDS medicine, as well as the foundation’s controversies. But what about Obama’s statement that Trump’s foundation "took money other people gave to his charity and then bought a six-foot-tall painting of himself"? The White House confirmed that the statement stems from a widely read Washington Post story by reporter David Fahrenthold, who’s written a series of stories about Trump Foundation and has inquired with organizations around the country to see if they actually received money from the real estate mogul. Fahrenthold provided new details of his investigations in a Sept. 10, 2016, Post article headlined, "How Donald Trump retooled his charity to spend other people’s money." Based on a review of 17 years of tax filings by the Donald J. Trump Foundation and interviews with more than 200 individuals and groups who were listed as recipients of its gifts, Fahrenthold found that "nearly all" of its money in recent years has come from people other than Trump, with his most recent personal gift to the foundation’s coffers dating from 2008. Experts told Fahrenthold that such an arrangement "is almost unheard of for a family foundation." The story by Fahrenthold includes the anecdote referenced by Obama in Philadelphia, which Fahrenthold wrote was one of two cases he found in which Trump used his money from the charity to "buy himself a gift." By doing so, he wrote, the foundation appeared to be flouting IRS rules by buying items that only seemed to be for Trump’s benefit. "In 2007, for instance, Trump and his wife, Melania, attended a benefit for a children’s charity held at Mar-a-Lago. The night’s entertainment was Michael Israel, who bills himself as ‘the original speed painter.’ His frenetic act involved painting giant portraits in five to seven minutes — then auctioning off the art he’d just created. "He painted Trump. "Melania Trump bid $10,000. "Nobody tried to outbid her. " ‘The auctioneer was just pretty bold, so he said, "You know what just happened: When you started bidding, nobody’s going to bid against you, and I think it’s only fair that you double the bid," ' Israel said in an interview last week. "Melania Trump increased her bid to $20,000. " ‘I understand it went to one of his golf courses,’ Israel said of the painting. "The Trump Foundation paid the $20,000, according to the charity that held the benefit." Fahrenthold’s article notes that the Post submitted detailed questions to the campaign but officials declined to comment. The campaign did not respond to an inquiry from PolitiFact for this article. We asked Fahrenthold whether Obama’s version jibed with his reporting. "It seems pretty accurate to me," Fahrenthold told PolitiFact. "I talked to both the charity that held the auction and the artist who made the painting. They told me Melania Trump had actually been the one bidding on the painting at the auction, which she won for $20,000 -- half went to charity, half went to the artist. But the actual check came from the Trump Foundation, of which Donald is president and Melania is not an officer of any kind." He added that the auction seems to have been held in 2006 but the check wasn’t cut until 2007, a year in which "almost all of the money in the Trump Foundation was other people’s money." Specifically, according to Fahrenthold’s reporting, the Trump Foundation began that year with $4,238 in the bank. Trump himself gave $35,000 to the foundation that year. But other donors gave $4.055 million, primarily a single $4 million gift from Vince and Linda McMahon, the founders of the WWE wrestling empire. Using the most generous calculation, Fahrenthold said, Trump’s own money accounted for less than 1 percent of the total amount that entered the foundation that year, $4,094,238. "So it was almost all other people’s money," he said. So where is the painting? That’s a bit more mysterious. Even crowdsourcing the search through Twitter hasn’t produced a verified image of the painting. "I can’t find the damn thing," Fahrenthold said. "It’s out there somewhere. Neither the painter nor the charity -- the Children's Place at Home Safe, in Boca Raton, Fla. -- have been able to provide a picture of it." Our ruling Obama said that Trump’s "foundation took money other people gave to his charity and then bought a six-foot-tall painting of himself." Fahrenthold verified the anecdote about the painting with the painter, and his reporting found that, at the time the painting was auctioned, the vast majority of funds in the foundation’s coffers were from other people, not Trump. Based on the information available, the story seems solid. We rate Obama’s statement True.	None	Barack Obama	None	None	None	2016-09-13T17:21:30	2016-09-13	['None']
pomt-06209	The national debt increased $16,000 every second George Allen served in the U.S. Senate.	true	/virginia/statements/2011/dec/08/tim-kaine/time-kaine-says-debt-grew-16000-every-second-georg/	Democrat Tim Kaine was not offering praise when he said Americans are indebted for Republican George Allen’s former service in the U.S. Senate. The national debt increased "by $16,000 every second of the six years he served," Kaine said in a Dec. 7 debate with Allen. The two former governors are running for the U.S. Senate seat held by Jim Webb, D-Va., who will not seek reelection next year. Allen served in the Senate from 2001 to 2007, narrowly losing a reelection bid to Webb. Kaine, during the debate, criticized Allen for consistently supporting Bush administration policies that Kaine said began the federal debt crisis. We were curious if the national debt really did increase by $16,000 every second Allen was in the Senate. So we unsheathed our calculators and went to work. Allen served 2,193 days in the Senate -- from Jan. 3, 2001 to Jan. 4, 2007. That’s 189,475,200 seconds. We visited a U.S. Department of Treasury website to determine the national debt on each date. Rounding off, it started at $5.72 trillion and ended at $8.67 trillion. That’s a $2.95 trillion increase during Allen’s term. The exact figure, if you’re interested, is $2,947,358,803,409.45. That means the national debt rose an average $15,555.38 each second Allen was in the Senate. You can reach Kaine’s $16,000 estimate by rounding up. There’s an issue, however, in holding Allen accountable for every appropriation from the day he entered the Senate to the day he left. The federal fiscal year runs from Oct. 1 through Sept. 30. The first spending votes Allen cast in the Senate were for the budget that began Oct. 1, 2001 -- some nine months after he entered office. And the last ones Allen cast were for the budget that ended Sept. 30, 2007 -- almost nine months after he left office. So, the real period of influence Allen had on federal spending ran from Oct. 1, 2001 to Sept. 30, 2007. The national debt rose by $3.202 billion during that span and, as we pointed out in a Truth-O-Meter earlier this year, Allen voted for each of about four dozen appropriation bills that came to the Senate floor during his term. In other words, Allen voted for budgets that increased the debt by $16,896.68 every second he was in the Senate. That’s slightly higher than Kaine’s estimate. But before you get angry at Allen, consider this: The debt has increased by $48,994.13 a second since Barack Obama became president. And Kaine, who served as Obama’s hand-picked chairman of the Democratic National Committee for two years before resigning in April, is a staunch defender of the president. Our conclusion: Kaine says the national debt increased by $16,000 every second Allen served in the U.S. Senate from 2001 to 2007. The actual number, from the day Allen entered the Senate to the day he left, is $15,555.38 per second. Kaine reasonably rounded up. Allen voted for budgets that increased the debt by $16,896.68 a second. We rate Kaine’s statement True.

pomt-00907	"Already this calendar year, since January 1, we have had more than 20,000 people come across the border, apprehended, unauthorized."	true	/texas/statements/2015/mar/03/greg-abbott/already-year-greg-abbott-says-over-20000-immigrant/	In a nationally televised interview, the governor of Texas said the border with Mexico remains unsecured — and offered up a figure as evidence. On CBS’s "Face the Nation," Abbott predicted a Texas-led court challenge to President Barack Obama’s actions shielding millions of unauthorized immigrants from deportation would end up at the Supreme Court. Reporter Bob Schieffer then asked if Abbott thought Congress should proceed to fully funding the Department of Homeland Security rather than keep pushing a Republican-steered proposal to tie continued funding to repealing Obama’s immigration actions. Abbott replied, in part, that: "...the first thing that we want to get out of Washington, D.C., is full funding to secure the border. The reason why we're in this problem to begin with is because the federal government has not stepped up to fulfill its duty to secure the border… Already this calendar year, since Jan. 1, we have had more than 20,000 people come across the border, apprehended, unauthorized. And so we have an ongoing problem on the border that Congress must step up and solve." We were curious about the 20,000-plus count. Abbott’s office didn’t engage when we inquired, but Tom Vinger, a spokesman for the Texas Department of Public Safety, separately emailed us a Feb. 18, 2015, agency document, "Texas Border Security Dashboard," including a chart stating that 21,808 "illegal aliens" had been arrested by the U.S. Border Patrol since Jan. 1, 2015, in the agency’s Texas sectors, including 14,281 in its busy Rio Grande Valley sector. Vinger said the counts were current as of approximately Feb. 18. Federal confirmation unavailable Our attempts to match those figures with information provided by the Border Patrol fell short. Spokesman Carlos Lazo said by email he didn’t have February 2015 apprehension totals. Separately, El Paso-based Border Patrol spokesman Doug Mosier emailed a chart indicating that in January 2015, 21,518 individuals were apprehended in the agency’s Southwest sector, covering Texas to San Diego, Calif. From that chart, we calculated that 13,289 people were apprehended in the Texas sectors that month, 8,427 of them in the Rio Grande Valley. Such arrests down from 2014? Uncertain Given that Abbott offered his figure as an indicator of border insecurity, we wondered how the government’s Texas apprehensions in January 2015 compared with such arrests in previous Januarys. To make that comparison, we turned to a Border Patrol presentation showing month-by-month counts from 2000 through most of 2014. Upshot: The 13,289 January 2015 Border Patrol apprehensions on the Texas side of the Rio Grande ran 5,409 behind some 18,698 apprehensions the same month a year earlier. The 2015 count was about 1,000 less than the 14,2013 apprehensions in January 2013. The January 2015 apprehensions exceeded the 10,846 and 7,779 apprehensions in Texas in January 2012 and January 2011, respectively.

Vinger emailed: "We can’t comment specifically on the Border Patrol numbers you provided." Still, he noted, fewer apprehensions occurred in the Rio Grande Valley, where the state has devoted resources to securing the border. The "dashboard" document says: "On June 18, 2014, the state Legislature and Texas leadership directed the Department of Public Safety to conduct a multi-agency surge operation in the Rio Grande Valley, which began on June 23, 2014. The goal of Operation Strong Safety is to prevent Mexican cartels, their operatives, transnational gangs, criminal aliens, potential terrorists and drugs from entering Texas between the Ports of Entry (POEs) through sustained, around-the-clock, ground, air and marine saturation patrols on the Texas/Mexico border, and in doing so, reduce transnational crime throughout Texas." Our ruling Discussing the security of the Texas-Mexico border, Abbott said since Jan. 1, 2015, "we have had more than 20,000 people come across the border, apprehended, unauthorized." State-provided figures indicate nearly 22,000 apprehensions by the Border Patrol from January through mid-February 2015. We didn't gather sufficient data to tell if that tally is down from the comparable part of 2014. We rate the statement True. TRUE – The statement is accurate and there’s nothing significant missing.

pomt-14512	"About 70 percent of Republicans nationwide ... don't think Donald Trump is the right guy" to take on Hillary Clinton in November.	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/feb/21/ted-cruz/do-republicans-think-donald-trump-right-candidate-/	Don’t let Donald Trump’s win in South Carolina fool you, says Texas Sen. Ted Cruz. The good majority of Republicans don’t actually support the frontrunner. Cruz made the case against Trump’s inevitability on NBC’s Meet the Press and argued that he, Cruz, was actually the best candidate for the job. "For anyone who doesn't believe that Donald Trump is the best candidate to go head to head with Hillary Clinton in November, and that's about 70 percent of Republicans nationwide who don't think Donald Trump is the right guy," Cruz said on Feb. 21. "Our campaign is the only campaign that has beaten Donald Trump and that can beat Donald Trump." This rosy forecast caught our attention (as well as the attention of Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, who made a similar claim on CBS’s Face the Nation). Is it true that 70 percent of Republicans "don’t think Donald Trump is the right guy?" The Cruz campaign referred us to Trump’s Real Clear Politics polling average of 34.2 percent, as of Feb. 17, 2016. This figure represents the portion of Republican primary voters who prefer Trump as the party’s nominee. "The point is, close to 70 percent of Republicans are choosing someone else," said Cruz spokesman Brian Phillips. True. But by this logic, about 80 percent of Republicans don’t think Cruz — who’s polling at an average of 20.6 percent — "is the right guy" either. Here’s a breakdown of the latest polls: Date Trump Cruz Rubio Fox News Feb. 15-17 36 19 15 NBC/Wall Street Journal Feb. 14-16 26 28 17 CBS Feb. 12-16 36 19 12 USA Today/Suffolk Feb. 11-15 35 20 17 Quinnipiac Feb. 10-15 39 18 19 The Economist/YouGov* Feb. 11-15 39 19 16 (* was not included in the Real Clear Politics aggregate) Cruz’s interpretation leaves out some nuance. Even though Trump isn’t the top pick for many Republican primary voters, a good chunk of them would be perfectly happy with him (or Cruz or Rubio for that matter) as the party’s nominee. Trump was the first or second choice for 47 percent of Republicans in a Fox News poll, for 38 percent in a NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll, for 44 percent in a USA Today/Suffolk University poll and for 52 percent in The Economist/YouGov poll. A similar portion of GOP voters (39 to 45 percent) named Cruz and Rubio as their top two picks. Trump is also viewed favorably by most of the party: about 62 percent of Republican voters in a Quinnipiac University poll and 62 percent in The Economist/YouGov poll. Cruz and Rubio commanded similar numbers. Conversely, in the Quinnipiac poll, more Republicans (31 percent) had an unfavorable opinion of Trump than Cruz or Rubio (23 percent). The three men clocked similar numbers in The Economist/YouGov poll. Trump does the worst when voters are asked if they could see themselves supporting him for the nomination. In a Feb. 17 NBC/Wall Street Journal poll, 42 percent of Republicans said no. In comparison, 33 percent could not see themselves supporting Cruz, and 28 percent said the same about Rubio. And finally, most Republicans would support any of the three men if they were the party’s nominee according to a CBS poll. But about a fifth of Republican voters said they wouldn’t back Trump (20 percent), Cruz (18 percent) or Rubio (17 percent) no matter what. Our ruling Cruz said, 70 percent of Republicans nationwide "don't think Donald Trump is the right guy" to take on Hillary Clinton in November. Cruz is referring to the polling average of 34 percent of GOP voters who say Trump is their top choice. Inverted, 66 percent of Republicans prefer someone else. That doesn’t mean, however, that the 66 percent refuse to support Trump overall. The highest estimate we found for Republicans flat-out protesting Trump is 42 percent. Cruz’s statement is largely accurate but leaves out some context. We rate it Mostly True.

pomt-15185	"If I had not asked for my emails all to be made public, none of this would have been in the public arena."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/aug/20/hillary-clinton/hillary-clinton-emails-wouldnt-be-public-if-i-hadn/	Hillary Clinton says her emails are now out in the open solely because she wanted them to be made public. In an Aug. 17 interview with Iowa Public Radio, Clinton told reporter Clay Masters what she thinks will come of her controversial decision to exclusively use private email while secretary of state. "I think this will all sort itself out," Clinton said. "And in a way, it’s kind of an interesting insight into how the government operates. Because if I had not asked for my emails all to be made public, none of this would have been in the public arena. But I want people to know what we did, I’m proud of the four years I was secretary of state." We know that Clinton did ask the State Department to release her emails, and they are now being released on a rolling basis. But it isn’t quite right to say that if she hadn’t made that request, her emails would not now be "in the public arena." A quick refresher on how and when this aspect of the email story unfolded: March 3: The New York Times broke the story that Clinton did not use a government email account for her entire tenure at the State Department.The story indicated it was unclear if the emails would be made public. March 4: Clinton tweeted, "I want the public to see my email. I asked State to release them. They said they will review them for release as soon as possible." March 5: Secretary of State John Kerry said in a press conference that the department was already reviewing the emails for release. Additionally, the State Department press office sent out a notice to reporters specifically responding to Clinton’s tweet that day. May 21: The State Department released the first batch of Clinton emails. The State Department’s decision to release the emails as soon as possible was a response to Clinton’s specific request. But even if she had not made that request, there were other people pushing to make the emails public. When the story broke, numerous media outlets and conservative organizations had already submitted Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests to the State Department, looking for various records (including emails) connected to Clinton. Up until that point, the State Department had yet to produce the vast majority of those records. Notably, Jason Leopold of Vice filed a FOIA request in November 2014 asking for all of Clinton’s emails, among other records, and he filed a lawsuit in January 2015 because of the State Department’s slow response. The State Department’s May 2015 response to Leopold’s lawsuit said the release of Clinton’s emails would satisfy a large portion of his FOIA request. It’s reasonable to assume that these FOIA requests would have eventually made the emails public, whether or not Clinton made her own request. Her emails, at least in part, might have been made public sooner, had she not exclusively used the private email address. Until Clinton turned over her emails to the State Department in December 2014 -- at the department’s behest -- the department did not have the full set of emails in its possession. This made Clinton’s emails basically inaccessible to FOIA requests until then. This wouldn’t have been the case if she used a government email address. Take the case of Gawker: In 2013, Gawker filed a FOIA request for emails between Clinton and long-time adviser Sid Blumenthal after a hacker revealed emails that Blumenthal sent Clinton. Although the emails were already known to the public, the State Department told Gawker that no such correspondence existed. In a previous article, we spoke with several experts who said Clinton’s email setup was tailor-made to circumvent FOIA requests. Additionally, Clinton’s phrasing is disingenuous. It implies that requesting her emails to be made public was a proactive measure, in the interest of transparency and highlighting her record as secretary of state. Rather, it was reactive -- a response to the New York Times article that broke the story and its aftermath. If Clinton’s email practices hadn’t come to light, it’s possible she would never have made such a request. Our ruling Clinton said, "If I had not asked for my emails all to be made public, none of this would have been in the public arena." The shred of truth here is that Clinton’s request was the driving force behind the State Department’s decision to release the emails as soon as possible. However, multiple pending FOIA requests for her emails likely would have made some of these emails public regardless. It’s disingenuous for Clinton to treat her request as proactive transparency, when her practices protected her email from public scrutiny until she was out of office. We rate Clinton’s claim Mostly False.	None	Hillary Clinton	None	None	None	2015-08-20T17:21:54	2015-08-17	['None']
pomt-08317	"Dan Gelber: On the record against scholarships to help our needy children attend Jewish private schools."	pants on fire!	/florida/statements/2010/oct/29/committee-florida-education/group-claims-gelber-against-scholarships-jewish-sc/	Halloween inspires some eye-catching campaign mailers, including one in the race for Florida's next attorney general. An electioneering group sent a mailer in mid October 2010 with a photo of Democratic candidate Dan Gelber on the front that describes him as "Toxic to Jewish Education'' with those words written in dripping blood-red, scary-looking type. Has he been lacing kosher meals at Jewish schools with arsenic? Ordering lead paint to be used at yeshivas? Oy vey! The other side of the mailer provides more details. It states: "Dan Gelber: On the record against scholarships to help our needy children attend Jewish private schools. ... Call Dan Gelber and remind him that there is nothing pathetic about our children's right to obtain a Jewish education!" Gelber, a Jewish Democrat, is running against Republican Pam Bondi on Nov. 2, 2010. But it wasn't Bondi who distributed the mailer: it was the Committee for Florida's Education, an electioneering communication organization. Though Bondi's campaign has repeatedly been quoted in news articles denying involvement, there is a connection to her campaign. The Miami Herald reported Oct. 29, 2010, that Bondi campaign spokeswoman Kim Kirtley is married to John Kirtley, vice chairman of the American Federation for Children, a national pro-voucher group, which gave $255,000 to the Committee for Florida's Education. Mr. Kirtley is also a Tampa-based Republican fundraiser and the American Federation was the only donor to the Committee for Florida's Education. Kim Kirtley sent an e-mail to PolitiFact Florida: "In response to your questions -- I reiterate that neither the campaign, or me personally, had any knowledge of the flier. John and I are both professionals who work in the political process, but his work is his own, and mine is my own." For this Truth-O-Meter, we will research, is Gelber "on the record against scholarships to help our needy children attend Jewish private schools?" Let's note at the start that the state and the mailer call these "scholarships" though they are often referred to as vouchers. And Gelber has been a firm opponent of vouchers ever since they appeared in Florida 10 years ago. The mailer cites a handful of votes Gelber took involving school vouchers, as well as some of Gelber's quotes in newspapers during the past decade. We will examine both. School voucher background Then-Gov. Jeb Bush signed a law in 1999 starting vouchers, which he called "Opportunity Scholarships," that allowed students who attended schools that received an "F" two years in a row based on FCAT scores to transfer to private schools or higher-performing public schools. In 2001, the state started the Tax Credit Scholarship Program to allow corporate donors to give money to nonprofit scholarship-funding organizations, which then give scholarships to poor children. The companies in turn received tax breaks from the state. In 2006, the Florida Supreme Court struck down the private school portion of the 1999 program, and the Legislature passed a bill to allow students who received those Opportunity Scholarships in the past to get the tax credit scholarships if they qualified based on having a low income. Today, the Florida Tax Credit Scholarship Program gives a maximum scholarship of $4,106. For the 2010-11 school year, 524 of these vouchers are used at Jewish schools out of 29,651 -- or about 1.7 percent, according to Department of Education spokeswoman Cheryl Etters. The students must be eligible for free or reduced-price lunches to qualify. Multiple mailers about Gelber Now, back to the committee that produced the mailers. Elnatan Rudolph, chair of the Committee for Florida's Education, is a Jewish political consultant who lives in New Jersey and is a former Teaneck, N.J., council member. He would not tell us his current party affiliation but said in the past he has been affiliated with both parties. He said he has relatives in Florida, including some who attend Jewish private schools. The committee has sent seven mailers about Gelber to 50,000 South Florida voters, Rudolph said. It also sent a mailer about Democratic gubernatorial candidate Alex Sink, and did newspapers ads on Gelber, Sink and Democratic CFO candidate Loranne Ausley. One of the newspaper ads about Gelber, which ran Oct. 22 in the Jewish Press of Pinellas County, was a "Wanted" poster for "crimes against Jewish education.... Voting 'No' on funding for Jewish schools." All of the mailers and newspaper ads are about vouchers. Gelber's votes and quotes Gelber, first elected to the state House in 2000 and the state Senate in 2008, has voted several times on vouchers. The mailer cites bills that Gelber voted "no" on that ultimately made it into law: • HB 21 May 4, 2001: A bill that related to taxation, including providing credit against taxes for contributions to nonprofit scholarship-funding organization. • SB 256 May 4, 2006: In the wake of the Florida Supreme Court declaring the 1999 Opportunity Scholarships unconstitutional, this bill allowed those students receiving Opportunity Scholarships -- if they were poor -- to transfer to the tax credit scholarships. • HB 653 May 2, 2008: Expanded the corporate income tax scholarship program, including making foster care children eligible. • HB 453 April 28, 2009: Made some revisions to the scholarship program. • SB 2126 March 24, 2010: Made still more changes to the program. Let's note here that none of those bills involved Jewish schools specifically. Now a look at the newspaper clips the mailer cited: • "This program needs major reformation. It's an embarrassment." St. Petersburg Times, Sept. 24, 2003. The article was about the state education commissioner at the time, Jim Horne, calling for an investigation into the Silver Archer foundation after about $400,000 in voucher money went missing. The article doesn't quote Gelber on his views on missing vouchers money, but here is his full quote: "I don't want to prejudge Silver Archer -- I don't know what they did -- but this program was an invitation for fraud waste and abuse. This program needs major reformation. It's an embarrassment." This article doesn't support the claim in the ad -- it just shows Gelber was concerned about fraud. • "Pathetic is zealously pursuing voucher programs that are not merely unconstitutional, but that bleed resources from a school system that can't afford to lose a dime." Gelber wrote an editorial for the South Florida Sun Sentinel July 4, 2005, that listed several things he found "pathetic" in response to Bush calling the Florida Democratic Party pathetic for payroll tax lapses. • "Floridians want us to fix public schools not push some right wing agenda to privatize schools." Gelber was quoted in the Miami Herald Feb. 16, 2006, in an article about Bush calling for a constitutional amendment on private school vouchers about a month after the Florida Supreme Court tossed out the state's first voucher program as unconstitutional. • "We are funding vouchers while rolling back Bright Futures." Gelber was quoted in the Tampa Tribune March 30, 2010, in a story about the Democratic attorney general primary race. (He isn't quoted as bluntly bashing vouchers in this article although Rudolph sent us an Oct. 11, 2009, Palm Beach Post article in which Gelber and fellow Democratic state Rep. Dave Aronberg, who lost to Gelber in the August primary, clashed on vouchers. The bill expanded eligibility for tax credits to insurance companies but didn't enlarge the $118 million scholarship program, the Post wrote. Aronberg voted for the bill while Gelber voted against it.) Gelber responds Gelber disputes the claim because he said it portrays him as voting for something specific to Jewish schools, while the vouchers apply to private schools in general. "There was no vote on Jewish schools,'' said Gelber in an interview. "I don't support the voucher program." Gelber campaign manager Christian Ulvert added in an e-mail: "Dan Gelber aggressively fought for stronger accountability and for reforms in an effort to protect taxpayer dollars. And while he opposes voucher programs because they drain resources from the public school system, they are here in Florida and as such should have strong accountability measures." We asked Rudolph why he felt it was a fair statement to suggest that Gelber was "on the record against scholarships to help our needy children attend Jewish private schools" when in fact his votes related more broadly to private schools -- only a small fraction Jewish, less than 2 percent. "He voted directly against money that is going to help needy Jewish children attend Jewish day schools. There is no way to say he voted against the whole program but did not mean it for one specific group,'' Rudolph said in an interview. "He voted against a program that funds needy Jewish children being able to afford to go to Jewish day schools. ... That's a fact." Our ruling We say no, that's not a fact. While Gelber has repeatedly voted against and criticized vouchers for any students, he has no record at all of voting against Jewish education, and it's a crass twist of logic to claim otherwise. Characterizing his long opposition to the voucher program as a direct vote against needy Jewish children is flat-out wrong. We rate this claim Pants on Fire.

pomt-01755	Says three Ukrainians recently captured on a West Texas ranch are among "individuals from countries that have strong terrorist ties being apprehended" near the state’s border with Mexico.	half-true	/texas/statements/2014/jul/31/rick-perry/rick-perry-recaps-arrests-men-ukraine-its-not-coun/	Gov. Rick Perry has talked up his decision to dispatch up to 1,000 National Guard members to the Texas-Mexico border by suggesting people crossing the border are wreaking havoc. In a July 23, 2014, interview by Sean Hannity of Fox News, Perry brought up a state tally of non-citizens booked into Texas county jails who, according to the Texas Department of Public Safety, have racked up thousands of criminal charges. The day of the Hannity interview, we rated as Pants on Fire Perry's claim that "illegal aliens" had committed over 3,000 homicides in six years; the posted information didn’t support that. Beyond crimes, Hannity said to Perry, the more important aspect of actions along the border "is Yemen, Pakistan, Afghanistan and Syria. They’re catching people from these countries crossing our border. "That concerns me," Hannity said. "That’s a national security issue. Reaction?" "As we shared with you," Perry replied, "the comptroller of public accounts, Susan Combs, who has a ranch out in far West Texas; on her ranch last week, there were three Ukraine individuals that were apprehended on that ranch. So we’re seeing, obviously, individuals from countries that have strong terrorist ties being apprehended as well as individuals who are committing crimes against the citizens of our state." Perry’s mention of arrestees from Ukraine, where a Malaysia Airlines passenger plane was shot down near the Ukraine-Russia border on July 17, 2014, and his reference to countries with strong terrorist ties made us wonder. We looked into the described arrests before checking the Eastern European country’s terrorist ties. Three men from Ukraine Chris Bryan, a Combs spokesman, said by phone that according to Combs, several individuals from Ukraine were apprehended on a neighbor’s ranch after likely walking across her ranch. Both spreads are in remote Brewster County, which borders Mexico. A June 15, 2014, Facebook post by that county’s sheriff’s office states early that Sunday, Sheriff Ronny Dodson fielded a call from a rancher saying three men, posing as lost hikers and tourists, had walked up to his house and asked to use his phone. According to the post, the men ran off after the rancher offered to call the sheriff. The chase was on, according to the post, with two men landing in custody after a "lengthy search" and the third man getting pinned in a box canyon. "It appears that all three individuals had entered into Mexico and crossed the border to gain illegal entry into the United States," the office said, adding the men were being held on several state charges. A June 16, 2014, news story posted online by Odessa’s CBS 7 quoted Dodson as saying the men were trying to reach a friend staying in Alpine who was supposed to ferry them to Seattle, Wash. "The officers were not able to apprehend the man who was their getaway," the story said. The sheriff’s office June 16, 2014, offense report on the arrests, which we obtained via an open-records’ request, said Homeland Security was contacted after it was discovered the men, ranging in age from 26 to 35, were in the country illegally from Ukraine. By phone, Dodson told us one of the men spoke English well and told him the trio hailed from Ukraine. They remain in the county jail, he said, though Brewster County doesn’t plan to press state charges. So, Perry was correct that three Ukrainians were arrested on a West Texas ranch, though he had the wrong ranch and his time frame was slightly off. Fresh charges, past convictions Next, Daryl Fields, a San Antonio-based spokesman for the U.S. Attorney’s office that has jurisdiction over the area, emailed us federal complaints and indictments indicating two of the men were previously deported Ukraine nationals newly indicted for re-entering the country without legal permission: Vadim Odorozhenko and Igor Yaroslavovuch Kotsiuba. According to the complaints, each man also had previously been convicted of crimes in the U.S. Odorozhenko "is an aggravated felon by virtue of his convictions for kidnapping, unlawful use of a weapon, and assault in the second degree and assault in the third degree," the complaint against him states. Our search using the LexisNexis database yielded indications Odorzhenko drew his convictions and served prison time in Oregon. By telephone, Jessica Freeburn of the Oregon Department of Corrections told us Odorozhenko was in a state prison from mid-August 2005 to Nov. 4, 2011. She said he was then paroled but records indicate he was picked up by immigration officers on Oct. 16, 2012. Separately by email, an ICE spokeswoman, El Paso-based Leticia Zamarripa, citing an "ongoing investigation," declined to say whether he was later deported. According to the complaint against Kotsiuba, he "is an aggravated felon by virtue of his convictions for the distribution of narcotics, assault and burglary." A LexisNexis search turned up nothing about him. A complaint charging Oleskii Storozhuk, the third alleged border-crosser, with entering the U.S. without legal permission was dropped, Fields said, but he "remains in custody as a material witness." Fields said by phone a fourth man, Igor Davidyuk, was charged with alien smuggling after his arrest in Washington state subsequent to the Texas arrests. Ukraine has terrorist ties? Ukraine gained its independence in 1991 after which the U.S. established diplomatic relations, according to the State Department. Of late, it’s been roiled by conflict with Russian separatists who want their Russian-speaking provinces to become part of Russia. But Ukraine isn’t among nations the U. S. considers state sponsors of terrorism nor was it listed among countries described by the government in 2013 as terrorist safe havens. Texas experts agreed Ukraine lacks terrorist ties. By email, Sergiy Kudelia, a Baylor University political scientist, said: "Generally speaking, there are no organizations or groups operating in Ukraine today that are recognized by the U.S. government (or the European Union) as terrorist organizations." After we pointed out a July 21, 2014, news report quoting Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko as saying he considers the Russian separatists to be terrorists, Kudelia said neither the U.S. or E.U. has embraced that characterization. By phone, Texas Tech University political scientist Frank Thames said he doesn’t think Russian separatists "are particularly interested in sending people to the United States through the southern border. I wouldn’t make that link." Our ruling Perry said three Ukrainians recently captured on a West Texas ranch are among "individuals from countries that have strong terrorist ties being apprehended" near the border with Mexico. This shakes out as half right. Three men from Ukraine were captured on a West Texas ranch in June 2014 (though Perry had the wrong ranch and his date was off a bit) after allegedly crossing the Rio Grande into Texas. However, Ukraine isn’t considered a country with terrorist ties. And while two of the men had prior U.S. criminal records, none has or had been charged with terrorism or related crimes. In contrast, Perry cited their arrests in the context of national security and terrorism. We rate this statement as Half True. HALF TRUE – The statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of context. UPDATE, 3:24 P.M. July 31, 2014: This story was amended to indicate one man was imprisoned in Oregon, not Washington, and to provide additional related detail. These changes didn't affect our rating.

pomt-01348	Says Jeanne Shaheen has "voted with the president 99 percent of the time."	mostly true	/new-hampshire/statements/2014/oct/21/scott-brown/scott-brown-says-jeanne-shaheen-voted-president-99/	It’s become a go-to line of Scott Brown’s campaign to win a New Hampshire seat in the U.S. Senate -- so much so that he repeated it several times during an hour-long debate on Oct. 21, the first televised face-off of the campaign. Shaheen, Brown said just seven minutes into the debate in Concord, "has in fact voted with the president over 99 percent of the time. What does that mean to people in New Hampshire? It means she was the deciding vote for Obamacare. … She’s also voted to put in place policies where we have more and more gridlock by voting with her party over 99 percent of the time." Brown has delivered variations of this claim so frequently over the past few months that anyone in New Hampshire who’s been plugged into an electronic device has surely heard it. It’s been a mainstay of Brown’s ads in a frenzied air war -- so far in the race for U.S. Senate, more than 10,000 ads have aired costing, more than $7 million. PolitiFact New Hampshire looked into a version of this claim last March, after the New Hampshire Republican Party released a web video titled "99 Percent." It claimed that Shaheen consistently supports the president and "votes with Obama 99 percent of the time." The ad was launched before Brown had officially declared himself a candidate in the race. Here, we’ll look at Brown’s claim that Shaheen has "voted with the president 99 percent of the time." (Last year PolitiFact New Hampshire checked the claim that Shaheen was the deciding vote for Obamacare and ruled that Mostly False.) Brown’s charge carries some weight. Even though Obama won New Hampshire twice, a majority of residents (55 percent) now disapprove of his job performance, and his signature legislative accomplishment -- the Affordable Care Act, or "Obamacare" -- is opposed by 52 percent of the people in the state, according to findings from an Oct. 10, 2014 Granite State Poll, conducted by the University of New Hampshire Survey Center. Democrats across the country have faced similar critiques from Republicans; PolitiFact has frequently checked such claims and found them to have varying degrees of accuracy. Obama himself acknowledged the strategy during a speech at Northwestern University on Oct. 2, 2014. "Now, I am not on the ballot this fall," Obama said. "But make no mistake: These policies are on the ballot -- every single one of them." During the debate, Brown even quoted the president to drive home his point. Of course, most politicians fall in line with the president when their party controls the White House. Still, we decided it would still be useful to dig into Shaheen’s voting record to see whether Brown was correct. When we checked this claim previously, we asked the NHGOP for evidence. Executive director Matt Mowers pointed us toward Congressional Quarterly’s annual presidential position votes report. CQ, a news service that covers Capitol Hill, examines voting patterns for every member of Congress and sorts them in ways that allow for comparisons. One of those ways is an annual examination of presidential support -- the number of votes by each lawmaker on bills in which the sitting president has staked out a position. The 2013 CQ analysis shows that, when you look at the pool of votes in which Obama took a clear position, Shaheen’s vote matched the president’s stance 99 percent of the time. Still, there’s more to that number than meets the eye. In 2013, the Senate took 291 roll call votes. CQ registers Obama as having taken a clear stance on 108 of those votes -- about one third. WMUR political reporter James Pindell further analyzed the figures and found that 70 of those votes involved presidential nominations -- to positions that ranged from Secretary of State John Kerry to a variety of federal judgeships. The remaining 38 involved some type of public policy, including seven on immigration, four on gun policy, and five budget bills. The only time Shaheen voted against Obama in 2013 came on a bill involving an Internet sales tax, Pindell reported. We found similar figures across CQ reports since Shaheen took office, which coincided with Obama’s election to his first term. CQ put her voting with Obama at least 95 percent of the time each year. Overall, during the five years since Shaheen took office, Shaheen’s votes have aligned with the president’s position 98 percent of the time. That’s pretty close to the 99 percent figure, however, it’s important to note some limitations of judging Shaheen’s support for the president based solely on the CQ analysis. Shaheen communications director Shripal Shah noted that the senator had broken with Obama on some issues that do not come to a vote; these are not reflected in the CQ tally. For instance, Shah noted that Shaheen spoke out against a new round of military base closures, an idea the Obama administration advanced in budget proposals, and she opposed a proposal floated by the president to change Social Security benefits. There are also other ways to measure Shaheen’s voting tendencies. OpenCongress, a nonpartisan legislative tracking service, found that in 2013, Shaheen voted with the majority of Democrats 93.1 percent of the time. That’s less frequently than the average Democrat in the Senate, putting her on the bottom half of the list. Finally, in June 2013, Shaheen was featured as a "Bipartisan Champion" by the Bipartisan Policy Center for her work on energy efficiency legislation. "It's disingenuous to draw conclusions about Sen. Shaheen's record by only looking at a small number of votes," Shah said. Our ruling Scott Brown said Shaheen votes with Obama 99 percent of the time. Brown has credible support for this claim -- in 2013, Shaheen took the same position as the president 99 percent of the time when Obama outlined a clear position, based on analysis by Congressional Quarterly. That wasn’t much different than earlier years in the Senate -- overall, her votes have aligned with Obama’s 98 percent of the time since she took office. Still, the CQ ratings address a fraction of all issues facing Congress. Obama only took a clear position in about one third of the Senate votes, and in some issues that didn’t come to a vote, Shaheen broke with the President. Still, Brown’s claim about Shaheen isn’t far off. We rate it Mostly True.	None	Scott Brown	None	None	None	2014-10-21T22:22:25	2014-10-21	['None']
pomt-02963	"In 45 out of 50 states, on average men are seeing their premiums double, going up 99 percent. Women up 62 percent."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2013/oct/24/sean-hannity/sean-hannity-says-average-man-will-see-his-premium/	If the rollout of the Obamacare website had gone well, we likely would be closer to having an answer to the all-important question: How much are people paying for health insurance and is it more than they did before? But for now, getting reliable answers can be treacherous. Conservative talk radio and Fox News Channel host Sean Hannity waded into the discussion on his radio program. A caller voiced frustration with the lack of jobs. Here’s the conversation that followed: Hannity: You know what the biggest job killer in the country is right now? Obamacare. Caller: One thing that can't be argued is that insurance premiums are too high. Hannity: They are skyrocketing. They are skyrocketing. I mean, in 45 out of 50 states, on average men are seeing their premiums double, going up 99 percent. Women up 62 percent. That's the average. Are Hannity's numbers right? Hannity’s staff told us the numbers came from an article in Forbes that provided the analysis of some number crunching by the Manhattan Institute for Policy Research, a conservative New York think tank. But Hannity's on-air statement went further than the report itself and included a common mistake. He lumped in people who purchase insurance on their own with people who receive it through their employer. The study focused explicitly on the insurance rates people can expect to encounter in the online marketplaces, which makes up less than 10 percent of the total private insurance market. Of that small subgroup, Hannity also failed to acknowledge that federal government subsidies will reduce many people’s out-of-pocket expenses, at least partially offsetting higher premiums. The Manhattan Institute study The Manhattan Institute analysts went through a complex process to estimate how premiums under Obamacare compared to premiums before the marketplaces opened. It drilled down to the county level in all 50 states and used a federal government website to gather health insurance prices in 2013 (before the Obamacare rollout). It looked at rates for 27-, 40-, and 64-year-old male and female non-smokers and adjusted prices upward to account for anyone who was denied coverage or had some health problem that would increase their rates. Then, the researchers looked at the prices for plans in the marketplaces for comparable individuals. The results were daunting. "The cheapest exchange plan for the average enrollee, compared to what a 40-year-old would pay today, will cost an average of 99 percent more for men, and 62 percent for women," the study said. The Manhattan Institute analysis refers only to people buying insurance through the marketplaces, which is called the "individual market." This is in contrast to the way that most Americans, about two-thirds, get insurance. They get coverage through their employer. The number of people in the individual market is expected to grow under the new health care law but right now, they represent less than 10 percent of people with insurance. We should note that the Manhattan Institute analysis relies on knowing how much people pay for insurance today, before Obamacare. That is something that a leading health policy research center has declined to do. The Kaiser Family Foundation’s Larry Levitt said there are several reasons not to compare cost before and after Obamacare. Part of the challenge is the new health care law requires that insurance plans include more services than many do today, such as maternity care and mental health coverage. That means the plans people will buy in 2014 are not the same as the ones they bought in 2013. And because the coverage is changing, apples-to-apples comparisons are challenging. Levitt said another major obstacle to before-and-after comparisons is that reliable data is unavailable. Insurance companies would have a key piece, but they keep it to themselves. "There is not good information about what people pay in the individual insurance market today," Levitt said. "And we certainly don’t know what types of plans people are going to choose after reform. Generally, Kaiser has predicted that premiums will be "somewhat higher" in the individual market than what they are today. The additional services come at a price. In addition, no one can be denied due to a pre-existing condition. Insuring them will tend to increase an insurance plan's costs. That might be offset if plenty of younger, healthy people also join the insurance pool, a stated goal of Obamacare but also one of the great unknowns. Federal subsidies The Congressional Budget Office, the research arm of Congress, projects that about half the people buying health insurance through the marketplaces will be eligible for subsidies in the form of tax credits. The more money you make, the less the subsidy. No subsidies are available for an individual making more than $43,000 a year, or a family of four making about $92,000 a year. The Manhattan Institute average rate increases for men and women did not factor in any subsidies. Our ruling Hannity said premiums are skyrocketing and the average man would pay twice as much, while the increase for the average woman would be 62 percent. That claim relies on a study that focused on the individual marketplaces for insurance set up under Obamacare, a subset of people who purchase insurance. Regardless of the accuracy of the analysis, it spoke to the experience of a small minority of Americans, and it did not factor in the subsidies that will cushion some people from increased premiums. Hannity overreached in his remarks on radio. That said, new rules for insurance plans will tend to push some rates up -- because the plans must provide better coverage. But by how much depends on a host of factors that several leading health policy experts say is too difficult to estimate. We rate this claim Mostly False.

pomt-08280	"Georgia has the second-highest rate of childhood obesity in the United States."	true	/georgia/statements/2010/nov/08/childrens-healthcare-atlanta/hospital-says-georgias-kids-second-fattest-nation/	The news was enough to make the AJC PolitiFact Georgia scribe toss her leftover Halloween candy corn to the squirrels. "Georgia has the second-highest rate of childhood obesity in the United States," said a recent news release from Children's Healthcare of Atlanta, a hospital that specializes in pediatric care. Second? Out of all the states in the union? Are Georgia kids really that hefty? Yes, we felt guilty. One PolitiFact Georgia reporter had spent a recent afternoon dressed as a witch, handing out fistfuls of sweets to trick-or-treaters. Childhood obesity can lead to diabetes, high cholesterol and other potentially deadly problems. It also places more burdens on the health care system. We called a spokeswoman for Children's Healthcare Atlanta, who pointed us to "F as in Fat," a report issued by the Trust for America's Health, a nonprofit group that specializes in disease prevention. Sure enough, there Georgia was, second only to Mississippi in 2007 for obesity rates among 10- to 17-year-olds. In this state, 21.3 percent of children were obese, the report said. Mississippi's rate was 21.9 percent. The report defined an "obese" child as one with a body mass index greater than the 95th percentile for his age group. For instance, a 10-year-old boy with a height of 4 foot 6 inches and weighing 100 pounds would be obese. That's because his body mass index is 24.1, which is in the 97th percentile of his age group. Of the 10 states with the highest childhood obesity rates, nine were in the South, the report said. Children in Western states tended to be far more svelte. Eight of the 10 states with the lowest obesity rates were located in that region. The trust used figures from the National Survey of Children's Health, an effort funded by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. The telephone survey asks parents for their children's ages, races, genders, weights and heights. Almost all the state-by-state rankings we found were based on data from that same survey. Understandably, they came up with similar results. The National Kids Count Program, run by the Annie E. Casey Foundation, used the same data to rank Georgia third in 2007. Its analysis ranked a slightly different group of kids: the number of children age 10-17 who are overweight as well as obese. Those are children whose body mass index is above the 85th percentile for their age and gender. A set of data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention provided different results, but this survey was far from comparable. The Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance System asks high school students in grades nine through 12 to report whether they are obese. The CDC does not rank states by high school obesity rates, but the data show that in 2009, 12.4 percent of Georgia high schoolers said they were obese. That's the 19th-highest of the states. But again, high schoolers report their own weight for this survey, and they might not be as accurate as their parents. The CDC does conduct a survey in which children are measured in person, but it doesn't break down the data by state. Why are Georgia's kids so heavy? We could locate no studies that answer that question, but there are some hints. The children who are at the highest risk for obesity are minorities or from rural areas, and they make up a large proportion of the state's child population, said Marsha Davis, a professor at the University of Georgia who studies childhood obesity. In rural areas, parents have trouble getting to supermarkets that sell fruits and vegetables. They end up feeding children with junk food they find at gas station convenience stores. For instance, the agricultural industry in South Georgia's Colquitt County ships produce across the country but sells very little locally, Davis said. The obesity rate there is extremely high. So while there is some variance in what surveys tell us, there's widespread agreement that Georgia kids are obese. And by one widely respected measure, Georgia's kids are the second-most obese in the nation. Now, that's not to say you need to throw out your kid's stash of Halloween candy. "Halloween is fun," Davis said. "The problem is we're having Halloween every day." We rate Children's Healthcare Atlanta's statement True.

pomt-00832	"Obama has been sending taxpayer dollars, at least $350,000 to fund anti-Likud, anti-Netanyahu groups in Israel for (the) election."	mostly false	/punditfact/statements/2015/mar/25/blog-posting/blog-claims-us-funded-anti-netanyahu-election-effo/	Did President Barack Obama spend U.S. taxpayer dollars trying to toss Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu out of office? That’s a claim floating around conservative media websites in recent days. A conservative blog called Fire Andrea Mitchell was one of several to relay a Fox News report about alleged back-door funding in the recent Israeli elections. On March 16, 2015, the blogger wrote "Obama has been sending taxpayer dollars, at least $350,000 to fund anti-Likud, anti Netanyahu groups in Israel for tomorrow’s election." Fox News said a congressional investigation into the matter is underway, and presidential contender Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, along with Rep. Lee Zeldin, R-N.Y., sent a letter about this to federal officials "to express our strong concerns over recent media reports." What are the facts of the matter? The basis of the claim In September 2013, the State Department funded two projects run by OneVoice, a New York nonprofit. The OneVoice mission is clear -- to advance a two-state solution in Israel and the Palestinian territories. "Through OneVoice, young grassroots activists in Israel and Palestine are equipped with the knowledge and skills to be heard as they build momentum and a constituency for the two-state solution locally and internationally," the organization wrote in its 2013 annual report. Affiliates OneVoice Israel got $233,500 from the State Department to spend in Israel and OneVoice Palestine got another $115,776 to spend in the Palestinian Territories. That adds up to a little more than $349,000. The question is: Do those contributions amount to funding "anti-Likud, anti-Netanyahu groups in Israel for tomorrow’s election"? How OneVoice says the money was spent Given that residents of the Palestinian Territories can’t vote in national Israeli elections, it’s hard to see how money spent there would influence voters in Israel. That leave us to account for $233,500. Payton Knopf, senior director of global communications for OneVoice, said the money helped fund a series of "town-hall style meetings on university campuses and provided support to the Knesset Caucus for the Two-State Solution in organizing a meeting with 300 Israeli students and (Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud) Abbas in February 2014." Knopf told us the State Department money was spent by November 2014 -- nearly four months ago. OneVoice, he said, never "spent any U.S. government funds in connection with the recent elections in Israel. Claims to the contrary are simply wrong." There are two important points to unpack there. If OneVoice says it spent the money by November 2014, that would be before the Israeli elections were even scheduled. That happened in December after Netanyahu called for early elections. The State Department said in a briefing that "no payment was made to OneVoice after November 2014." That would contradict the way the claim in the blog was phrased. "Has been sending" says the money continues to flow. In this case the money was spent and disbursed months ago. Second, while Netanyahu waffled on the notion of a two-state solution in the run-up to the Israeli elections, the prime minister had been on record supporting a two-state strategy in November and the months before it. Where it gets complicated Put aside OneVoice’s explanation for a second. In January 2015, after the Israeli elections had been scheduled, OneVoice announced a partnership with V15, a new Israeli voter mobilization project. The partnership’s mission, as stated in its press release, was to "disrupt the status quo." Using methods honed from the Obama campaign, including a key staffer from the president’s 2012 field operation, V15 aimed to put a center-left coalition into power. While its leaders officially denied that they opposed Netanyahu, it was a difference without a distinction. V15 wanted a government that would do more than Netanyahu’s Likud Party to negotiate with the Palestinians. (All you have to do is read parts of V15’s statement after Netanyahu’s victory to know where the group stands: "A confusing night turned into a painful morning," the group said, according to a translation from Arutz Sheva. "It was painful not because we lost, but because we have no faith in the winners.") So the connecting of the dots goes like this. Obama’s State Department gives OneVoice money. OneVoice trains student activists. Later, OneVoice strikes up a partnership with V15, which is aided by a former Obama campaign hand. V15, a voter mobilization project, wants to "disrupt the status quo." The status quo in this case is Netanyahu. A limited money trail The connections between OneVoice, Obama and V15 may raise plenty of questions, but they don’t prove that U.S. tax dollars funded "anti-Likud, anti Netanyahu groups in Israel for tomorrow’s election." Gerald M. Steinberg is a professor at Bar Ilan University and head of NGO Monitor, a project that aims to prevent nonprofit meddling in Israeli affairs. Steinberg is suspicious that State Department dollars helped V15, at least indirectly, but he can’t know for sure based on the information available. In a draft report Steinberg shared with PunditFact, all he has are questions. "Did OneVoice use U.S. government funds to launch V15? If not, and since money is fungible, did U.S. government funds free up other OneVoice financing to facilitate V15? Full transparency on the parts of the U.S. State Department, OneVoice, and V15 is necessary to verify or disprove the allegations and claims." IRS regulations prohibit a not-for-profit OneVoice from campaigning directly for or against a candidate from office. But there are allowances when it comes to campaigning for issues (a two-state solution) or for promoting civic engagement, which would include voting. It’s worth noting that about a month before the election, the parent organization of OneVoice created PeaceWorks Action, a 501(c)4 group. That IRS designation allows it to engage in outright political lobbying. Funding OneVoice was entirely in line with the administration’s agenda. As far back as 2009, Hillary Clinton said in her Senate confirmation hearing to be secretary of state that in pursuit of a state for Palestinians "we will exert every effort to support the work of Israelis and Palestinians who seek that result." Our ruling A conservative blog claimed, "Obama has been sending taxpayer dollars, at least $350,000 to fund anti-Likud, anti Netanyahu groups in Israel for tomorrow’s election." First, there is the matter of the dollar amount. If any U.S. money was used to mobilize anti-Likud voters, it would have been in Israel. A more accurate figure would be $233,500. Next, there is a matter of the blog’s tense. "Has been sending" says the action is continuing. In this case, the money stopped flowing in 2014, before elections were called in Israel. Finally, the allegation that the money was spent to fund anti-Likud, anti-Netanyahu groups in Israel for the election is based on speculation. Yes, Obama sent money to OneVoice, a group that promoted a two-state solution. And yes that group partnered with a different group V15 that wanted Netanyahu defeated. But there is no paper trail that the money given to OneVoice was spent on an electoral ground game. It would be naive to ignore that OneVoice’s policy positions mesh well with V15’s voter mobilization, but that’s different from saying that American taxpayer dollars were spent by V15. That may change as more evidence comes to light. PunditFact’s rulings are based on when a statement was made and on the information available at that time. This claim rates Mostly False.

pomt-06309	Gov. Scott Walker received a $7,300 pay raise.	false	/wisconsin/statements/2011/nov/15/state-democratic-party-wisconsin/wisconsin-democratic-party-says-gov-scott-walker-r/	The reaction to plans by Gov. Scott Walker to freeze the pay of state workers continues to roll in. And Walker’s own pay continues to be a focal point of his opponents. On Nov. 9, 2011, the Democratic Party of Wisconsin issued a news release that attempted to fan the fire. The group, which is launching a recall against the first-term Republican governor, says Walker has given himself a pay raise -- and he should give some of it back. "The rest of Wisconsin is being asked to accept less and suffer his unemployment economy, but apparently Scott Walker thinks he deserves a $7,300 raise," state Party Chairman Mike Tate was quoted as saying in the news release. A raise when pay for others is frozen? This one sounds familiar. We looked at this same topic recently when various liberal bloggers said Walker had given himself -- along with other statewide elected officials -- a pay hike. They had misread a sloppily prepared document about the pay changes. We ruled the claim on Walker’s raise False. The state Democrats revived the topic with their news release, which took Walker to task for "whining" about his family’s loss of buying power in a TV interview. We asked party spokesman Graeme Zielinski for backup on the claim that Walker had received a raise. His reply: "Why do we have to do your homework for you? Go ask the executive office. Google. You arrive at the same conclusions regardless of whether we help you or not, and then congratulate yourself, so why should we waste our time?" OK. Here’s what state law says: Walker is not receiving a raise in January. That would violate Article IV, Section 26 of the the state Constitution. Here’s how it works. Walker took office in January and was paid $144,423. That’s $7,331 more than his predecessor, Democratic Gov. Jim Doyle. State law calls for the pay of the governor, other state constitutional officers, and members of the Legislature to be set before their terms of office begin. In Walker’s case, the higher salaries were proposed by Doyle’s administration and approved by state lawmakers in 2008. So Walker received one level of pay when he took office. Under the state constitution, that pay will not change for the duration of his four-year term. Critics have noted that Walker will be making more than Doyle (true), that as Milwaukee County Executive he gave back some of his pay (true) and that he could choose to do the same as governor (true). But that’s not what the party said. The Democrats called upon Walker to "return his $7,300 raise." Their statement continued: "As pay remains the same for Corrections Officers, Licensed Practical Nurses, Social Workers and Facilities Maintenance Employees, Scott Walker's salary increases by more than $7,331." So let’s bring this one home. Again. The state Democrats’ news release states that the governor "is set to make $143,000," and says Walker "thinks he deserves a $7,300 raise," and calls upon the governor to "return his $7,300 raise." The release states that Walker’s "salary increases by more than $7,331." That’s wrong, wrong and still wrong. The pay for Walker -- or whoever succeeded Doyle as governor in January 2011 -- was long ago established. It’s one amount -- $144,423 -- and it can’t change. Walker can’t give himself a pay raise. It’s right there in the state Constitution. We rate the statement False.	None	Democratic Party of Wisconsin	None	None	None	2011-11-15T09:00:00	2011-11-09	['None']
pomt-06909	"This past (legislative) session, we passed out of the Legislature a resolution requiring Congress to pass a balanced-budget amendment to the (U.S.) Constitution."	half-true	/texas/statements/2011/jul/25/david-dewhurst/david-dewhurst-says-2011-legislature-required-cong/	Offering himself as a fiscally conservative candidate for the U.S. Senate, Texas Lt. Gov. David Dewhurst says in his opening campaign video that his record shows he knows how to hold the line on spending. Washington, he continues, is addicted to debt. In contrast, he adds, "This past (legislative) session, we passed out of the Legislature a resolution requiring Congress to pass a balanced-budget amendment to the (U.S.) Constitution." An online news search indicated that Dewhurst, who declared his candidacy July 19, was referring to House Concurrent Resolution 18, which the House and Senate advanced in May. The House vote for the resolution was 115-17, the Senate vote 28-3. The resolution doesn’t require Congress to do anything. It states, though, that given large annual federal deficits and the escalating national debt, and the failure of Congress to forward a balanced-budget constitutional amendment to the states, "action must be taken to restore fiscal responsibility." It goes on to say that a "balanced-budget amendment would require the government not to spend more than it receives in revenues and compel lawmakers to carefully consider choices about spending and taxes; by encouraging spending control and discouraging deficit spending, a balanced-budget amendment will help put the nation on the path to lasting prosperity." The resolution closes by stating the Legislature "respectfully urges" Congress to "propose and submit to the states for ratification" a constitutional amendment providing that except during a war declared by Congress or other "national emergency," total federal appropriations in a fiscal year may not exceed the year’s estimated federal revenue. The next section calls for the resolution to be forwarded to Congress to be placed in the Congressional Record. For perspective, we contacted the resolution’s author, Rep. Brandon Creighton, R-Conroe, who said that while no legislative resolution can make Congress do anything, "political tides have been spread by much less than a resolution backed by a legislature that represents over 25 million people." Creighton said he thinks his resolution impresses on Congress that there’s reason to bring up the amendment. "In the aggregate, state by state by state, these legislatures sending these strong statements of political will" have an effect, he said. Creighton said he’s not troubled by Dewhurst saying the resolution requires Congress to approve the amendment. "I don’t believe anybody’s interpretation is that Congress has to act on it," Creighton said, adding that even a novice observer wouldn’t conclude that a Texas-rooted resolution amounts to "an iron-clad requirement" that Congress act. "It’s kind of a gotcha that doesn’t matter," he said. By the way, Congress cannot directly amend the Constitution. Article V says an amendment can originate by two-thirds’ votes of the U.S. House and Senate, but still must be ratified by three-fourths of the states’ legislatures. Alternatively, the Constitution can be amended at a convention called by two-thirds of the states’ legislatures. In February, after the Texas Senate passed a different version of the call for a balanced-budget amendment, Dewhurst issued a statement characterizing the resolution as urging prompt action, noting that it takes ratification by three-fourths of the states for a constitutional amendment to stick. In contrast, Dewhurst’s campaign video leaves the misimpression Congress can, by itself, change the Constitution. It also misrepresents the Texas resolution by saying it "requires" Congress to affix the balanced-budget amendment. But the spirit of his message — that Texas legislators are aboard with the constitutional change — is accurate. We rate his statement Half True.

pomt-09371	"An attack on a healthy 22-year-old homosexual man would be more protected under the law than an attack on an eight-year-old child."	half-true	/texas/statements/2010/mar/30/liberty-institute/liberty-institute-says-22-year-old-gay-man-more-pr/	Criticizing federal hate crimes law, the right-leaning Liberty Institute sniffs at extending additional legal protections to victims attacked because of their sexual orientation or gender. The group says online that a protected classes contradict equal protection under the law, adding that "many see the expansion of hate crimes laws as a tool to silence opposition to homosexuality and eventually silence pastors from speaking Biblically on the subject." "Hate crimes law put citizens in different classes of people and protect some more than others," the group says on its Web site. "For example, an attack on a healthy 22-year-old homosexual man would be more protected under the law than an attack on an eight-year-old child. Liberty Institute believes that all crimes should be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law without putting citizens in classes, attempting to protect some more than others, and attempting to punish people's thoughts." Eight year olds, less protected than adults? Jonathan Saenz, the group's Austin-based director of legislative affairs, pointed to the Matthew Shepard and James Byrd, Jr. Hate Crimes Prevention Act, which expanded federal legal protections against violent acts motivated by sexual orientation, gender, and disability. "Hate crimes laws give more protection under law for members of the special classes of people," Saenz said. "Age is not included as a protected class for victims, sexual orientation is included as a protected class. So, an attack on a healthy 22-year-old homosexual man would be more protected under the law than an attack on an eight-year-old child." Some background: The 2009 act is named for Matthew Shepard, a gay college student who died after being kidnapped, pistol-whipped and tied to a Wyoming ranch fence in near-freezing temperatures, and James Byrd Jr., a black man who was dragged behind a car to his death the same year by three white men near Byrd's home in Jasper, Texas. The law lets the U.S. Department of Justice help states investigate and prosecute hate crimes. In the case of five states that don't have hate crime laws, federal prosecutors can prosecute the crimes independently. Congress earlier put in place a law directing government to create enhanced penalties for hate crimes — motivated by actual and perceived race, color, religion, national origin, ethnicity, gender, disability or sexual orientation — that occur on federal property. The combined effect of the Shepard Act and the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act, adopted in 1994, means that someone who attacks a healthy 22-year-old homosexual man because of his sexual orientation could be subject to a tougher sentence than someone who attacks an eight year old. But that's just considering those federal hate crime laws, not all the other applicable state and federal laws. Bill Allison, director of the Criminal Defense Clinic at the University of Texas School of Law, rates the Liberty Institute's comparison as bogus because various state and federal laws provide harsher sentences for a wide range of groups. Allison said: "We give extra protection and punishment to pregnant women, to police and firefighters to children under six... the list goes on and on." The Texas Penal Code, for example, increases the sentence for someone who assaults anyone 14 or younger or, conversely, 65 and older. Criminals who harm a pregnant woman's unborn child could also face additional charges. And under the Texas Code of Criminal Procedure, a judge can require a convict to take a course in tolerance if arson, criminal mischief or reckless damage or destruction are proved beyond a reasonable doubt to have been committed against someone because of that person's race, color, disability, religion, national origin or ancestry, age, gender or sexual preference. Another Texas law: The minimum term of imprisonment increases to 25 years if the criminal is convicted of aggravated sexual assault on a child younger than six. Why have special laws for people who are attacked because of their race, sexual orientation or gender? Trevor Thomas, deputy communications director at the Human Rights Campaign, a national organization that advocates for lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender equality, offers this explanation: "Sentencing enhancements for hate crimes recognize that hate-crime perpetrators commit violent acts as a means of sending a message to society ... While a random act of violence is a tragic event that devastates, the enhancements reflect this understanding that hate crimes are unique in that they victimize an entire community of people." Applying hate crimes law is complicated. If a straight man and a gay man get in a fight, it's not a hate crime unless the straight man attacked the gay man because he is homosexual, Allison said. In other words, a healthy 22-year-old man wouldn't be protected under the Shepard Act unless the prosecutor can prove that he was attacked because of his sexual orientation. George Dix, the chair of criminal law at the University of Texas at Austin, said: "Clearly the law does permit prosecutors, judges and juries to impose more severe penalties where the victims of crimes are in certain classes. Insofar as the severity of penalties reflects an effort to extend greater protections to victims, I suppose to could be said that the law is making greater effort to protect persons in the specific 'classes.'" But the law does this for a great many classes, and not just those containing people, Dix said. Under a Texas theft statute, he said, someone who steals an exotic fowl could be more severely punished than if they steal a chicken. Or, stealing fuel from a gas station could be more prosecuted than stealing it from a car. So the station owner would be more protected than the owner of the affected car. "Our criminal laws are full of distinctions that result in part in extending more protections to certain classes of people. No reasonable person could argue that this is inherently inappropriate," said Dix. Dix helped us reason how someone who assaulted a gay, adult male — meaning the perpetrator intentionally and knowingly caused him bodily injury, but not serious bodily injury — might fare in court in contrast to how they'd fare if they assaulted an eight year old. Per the Texas Penal Code, the attack on the child would be a third-degree felony, Dix said, punishable by imprisonment for a term of not more than 10 years or less than 2 years. The attack on the 22 year old would, generally, be a Class A misdemeanor, he said, normally punishable by a jail term of no more than a year. Generally, hate crimes law "makes the offense punishable under the next highest category," he said. "But for Class A misdemeanors, the effect seems to be to instead impose a minimum term of confinement of 180 days. Summing up: Lots of special classes have extra legal protections — many of which existed before protections were extended based on gender, gender identity and sexual orientation. The bottom line: Under the Shepard Act, an attack on a healthy 22-year-old homosexual man could — not would, as the Liberty Institute states — be more protected than an attack on an 8-year-old. But it takes a contortion to reach that conclusion. The statement incorrectly intimates that hate crimes laws are the only ones on the books, ignoring the web of other state and federal criminal laws offering protections to vulnerable groups of people — including children.

pomt-14220	"We’re the worst state in the country at moving people from welfare to work."	false	/missouri/statements/2016/apr/18/catherine-hanaway/hanaway-wrong-about-missouris-rate-moving-people-w/	At the March 17 Republican gubernatorial debate, former Speaker of the Missouri House of Representatives Catherine Hanaway made a strong statement about the effectiveness of welfare in Missouri. "We're the worst state in the country at moving people from welfare to work," Hanaway said. Worst in the country is a serious indictment. We wanted to know where Hanaway found her information — and if Missouri really does rank dead last. We got in touch with Will Scharf, policy director of Hanaway for Governor, and he pointed us to a 2015 Welfare Report Card issued by the Heartland Institute. The Heartland Institute is a conservative think tank. Its report evaluates and ranks states' policies under the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families program, the assistance program for low-income families established when Congress passed a welfare-to-work reform act in 1996. The report assigns a letter grade based on the TANF policies of each state. It awards higher grades for states with strict work requirements, shorter lifetime eligibility limits, stiffer sanctions and other features. Missouri received an F from the Heartland Institute, the lowest score in the nation. But at the debate, Hanaway didn't say we earned an F, or that our welfare policies are the worst in the country. She specifically claimed Missouri is the worst at moving people from welfare to work, and that's where things get complicated. Why people leave TANF The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services tracks the reasons families stop receiving TANF benefits in each state. Employment, exceeding the time limit, receiving sanctions and voluntarily closing one's case are all possible options. In Missouri, 81 percent of families stopped receiving benefits due to employment in 2014, the most recent data. That's far from the worst welfare-to-work rate in the country — it's the highest. By comparison, the national percentage for leaving TANF for employment is just 15.8 percent. But there's a twist: The secret to Missouri's success might be the same reasons Heartland Institute gave the Show-Me state a failing grade. We spoke to Liz Schott, senior fellow at the left-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, who told us that Missouri's longer lifetime limit and lighter sanctions meant fewer cases were closed for reasons other than employment. The HHS data blurs what's actually going on in another way. Schott explained that families will often voluntarily end their benefits when a family member gets a job. In this case, other states might have higher rates of cases closing due to employment, but it isn't getting recorded that way. What happens to families after they leave TANF is also rarely tracked. There is no standard federal measure, and it isn't common at the state level either. That makes it tough to evaluate the success of any given state at moving people from welfare to work and keeping them there. Missouri's new law When the Heartland report came out in March 2015, it caught the attention of Missouri Republicans. Inspired by the report, Sen. David Sater, R-Cassville, sponsored the Strengthening Missouri Families Act, which called for strict restrictions on TANF benefits and passed after an override of Gov. Jay Nixon's veto. The law, which took effect in January, cuts the lifetime limit on benefits from five years to 3 1/2, institutes sanctions that cut benefits in half if a recipient fails to complete required training and employment-seeking activities, and cuts them off completely if the requirements aren't met in ten weeks. Our ruling Catherine Hanaway called Missouri the worst state in the country at moving people from welfare to work Her source was a report by the conservative Heartland Institute. But that report assigned grades based on a state's TANF policies, not the percentage of people leaving TANF for employment. By that measure, according to federal statistics, Missouri isn't the worst state, it's the best in the country. The numbers may be a bit imprecise, but they more than show Missouri far from last place.

pomt-05011	Says Mitt Romney had millions in the Cayman Islands, a tax haven.	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/jul/17/barack-obama/obama-ad-says-romney-stashed-money-cayman-islands/	A snarky ad juxtaposes an off-key Mitt Romney leading a crowd singing America the Beautiful with claims on the screen saying the Republican candidate has parked millions of his personal fortune far from U.S. shores. "He had millions in a Swiss bank account," the ad says, and in "tax havens like Bermuda … and the Cayman Islands." It ends with: "Mitt Romney’s not the solution." We rated the Swiss bank account claim True. Here we’ll dig into the Cayman Islands charge. Romney has released his tax return for 2010 and an estimate for 2011 indicating that his income was $21.7 million in 2010 and $20.9 million last year. His financial disclosure, which is required of all presidential candidates, shows that Romney’s personal wealth is somewhere between $85 million and $264 million, according to the Washington Post. News organizations have analyzed how Romney has invested his money, gleaned the greatest tax benefits and maximized profits at Bain Capital, the private equity firm he founded. The Cayman Islands is mentioned in several of the reports: * Romney utilized shell companies in the Cayman Islands and Bermuda to attract foreign investors to Bain, according to 2007 documents analyzed by the Los Angeles Times. The Times identified one such fund as BCIP Associates III Cayman. It’s listed on Romney’s 2007 financial disclosure as having paid him more than $1 million the previous year in dividends, interest and capital gains. * Early in 2012, ABC News reported that Romney "has as much as $8 million invested in at least 12 funds listed on a Cayman Islands registry. Another investment, which Romney reports as being worth between $5 million and $25 million, shows up on securities records as having been domiciled in the Caymans." That fund, called BCIP Trust Associates III, is part of his individual retirement account and provided between $1,000,000 and $5,000,000 in income, the disclosure shows. David S. Miller, a tax attorney with Cadwalader, Wickersham & Taft LLP in New York, told PolitiFact that tax-exempt entities, including IRA accounts, sometimes invest through Cayman Islands corporations to reduce their U.S. taxes. "Congress did not deliberately allow tax-exempts to reduce their U.S. taxes by investing through Cayman Islands corporations," Miller said. "However, the practice is widespread and the IRS has approved of it." Miller agreed that it’s accurate to call the Cayman Islands a tax haven. "That phrase usually refers to whether the jurisdiction imposes taxes and the Cayman Islands doesn’t," he said. Other, more nuanced advantages exist for high net-worth individuals who put their money in foreign corporations. For example, a high net-worth individual can’t deduct the management fee paid to a fund manager, but a foreign corporation can. "There are other advantages for U.S. taxpayers who invest through foreign corporations. They’re relatively subtle, but the advantages increase as the tax rates increase," Miller said. Finally, in a transcript of a conference call hosted by the Romney campaign in January 2012, the trustee for the Romney family’s financial investments -- Brad Malt of the law firm Ropes & Gray -- acknowledged the existence of the Cayman investments. "These are investments in third-party entities," Malt said, likening them to stock in Toyota. He continued: "Each of these investments is in a blind trust. … This means the decision to make the investment was made by me, not by Gov. Romney. … I should say I, in turn, have no control over where these funds are formed. … When we make an investment in a Cayman fund, we're presented with investment documents, the sponsor has already chosen where the fund is to be organized, and to be perfectly clear, the blind trusts are a tiny part of the investor base of these funds." He went on to emphasize that each of the Cayman funds files a U.S. tax return, which reports the blind trust's share of the fund income. "Every dime of that, in turn, is reported on Gov. Romney's tax returns," Malt said. When we asked the Romney campaign for a response to the Obama ad, a spokesman emphasized these same points -- that Romney has paid all taxes he owed, that investment decisions were made by the trustee and the trustee does not decide where the funds are "domiciled." Our ruling Obama’s ad says Romney had millions of dollars in the tax-friendly Cayman Islands. Romney’s trustee acknowledged investing Romney’s money in funds located there, and several are listed on his financial disclosures. Those forms indicate the value of those investments is in the millions. There's no evidence of anything illegal or improper, but it's clear that Romney had millions in the Caymans. We rate the claim from the Obama ad True.	None	Barack Obama	None	None	None	2012-07-17T16:30:40	2012-07-14	['Cayman_Islands']
pomt-10275	Says McCain "supported George Bush's policies 95 percent of the time."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/aug/23/joe-biden/cherry-picking-mccains-record/	At a rally celebrating his selection as Sen. Barack Obama's running mate, Sen. Joe Biden invoked a line from the Obama playbook that seeks to link Sen. John McCain to President Bush. "You can't change America when you supported George Bush's policies 95 percent of the time," Biden said of McCain. Biden is guilty of some cherry-picking here. He is right that McCain voted with the Bush administration 95 percent of the time in 2007, according to an analysis by Congressional Quarterly. But he fails to mention the year, as Obama did when we gave him a True in June, and Biden conveniently leaves out other years when McCain's support for Bush was lower. The number comes from CQ's "presidential support" score, which rates how often lawmakers back or oppose the president. One caveat: McCain missed more than half the votes on which Bush had a position, as he campaigned for the White House. But repeated votes on immigration and the Iraq war — two issues on which he was closely allied with Bush — as well as the filibuster votes helped elevate McCain from one of the president's chief adversaries three years ago to one of his biggest supporters. McCain's 95 percent score was the high-water mark of his presidential support during President Bush's tenure, and was partly a reflection of the new political calculus in the Democratic-controlled Congress. But other years, McCain's rating was lower. He supported Bush as infrequently as 77 percent of the time in 2005, and backed the president's position an average of 89 percent of the time since 2001. By congressional standards, that's solidly partisan, but hardly marching in lockstep. Biden would have been right if, like Obama, he mentioned the year. But he didn't and gave a misleading picture of McCain's support for Bush. That sounds Half True to us.	None	Joe Biden	None	None	None	2008-08-23T00:00:00	2008-08-23	['None']
pomt-05547	"As the usage [of synthetic marijuana] has dramatically increased, instances of violence, bodily harm and even death have risen with it."	mostly true	/georgia/statements/2012/apr/09/nathan-deal/deal-fake-marijuana-use-rising-connected-death-vio/	Phony marijuana targeted by recent state legislation sounds worse than the real thing, if you believe Georgia’s governor. Chase’s Law strengthens a ban on "synthetic marijuana," ground-up plant material laced with chemicals that mimic marijuana. Chase Burnett, the bill’s namesake, was found dead in March in a hot tub at his Fayette County home, a packet of the drugs nearby. He was 16. The bill passed with overwhelming support. On March 27, Gov. Nathan Deal signed it into law. A press release warned of synthetic marijuana’s dangers: "As the usage has dramatically increased, instances of violence, bodily harm and even death have risen with it," it said. We’ve heard that the drug is nasty stuff. But what’s this about violence, bodily harm and death? A Deal spokeswoman sent PolitiFact Georgia news stories and poison control data to prove the governor’s point. We also talked to researchers and law enforcement officials and reviewed news stories and scientific studies. The form of synthetic marijuana that’s sparking so much concern is sold at head shops and gas stations under brand names such as "Spice" and "K2." Georgia made it a felony to manufacture and sell it in 2010. Chase’s Law tries to keep underground chemists from tweaking their recipes to get around state restrictions. There’s little scholarly research on the drug, which appears to be new to the U.S. Federal labs first detected these drugs in November 2008, according to the Drug Enforcement Administration. The earliest U.S. news story we found about its rising popularity appeared in a Hutchinson Kan., newspaper in November 2009. All signs suggest that synthetic marijuana use is increasing dramatically, but data is in short supply. Workers at the American Association of Poison Control Centers began tracking synthetic marijuana calls in 2010 after they noticed more inquiries, a spokeswoman told PolitiFact Georgia. In 2010, they received 2,906 calls; in 2011, there were 6,959. About 11 percent of high school seniors reported using synthetic marijuana in the past year, according to 2011 results of an annual survey by the National Institute on Drug Abuse. It was the first time researchers asked about the drug. Existing data support Deal’s claim that reports of bodily harm have climbed. Georgia Poison Center call data show 10 users were admitted to a hospital’s critical care unit in 2010 after using the drug. Forty-five were admitted in 2011. Rapid heartbeat, agitation, drowsiness, vomiting, hallucinations and nausea were among the drug’s most common effects, researchers have found. Media accounts report drug users injured in car crashes, falls and other accidents -- some fatal. Whether synthetic marijuana is directly responsible for deaths -- and whether they’re increasing -- is a more complicated issue. We found no published studies on the drug’s lethality, but there have been "scattered reports of deaths," said Lloyd Johnston, a University of Michigan professor who conducted the National Institute on Drug Abuse survey. A count of news stories suggests there are more deadly cases. But whether the drug is a direct cause or contributing factor is not clear in some instances. Consider Burnett’s death. Toxicology tests are still in the works. Whether the official cause of death was drowning, the drug or something else is unsettled. Georgia Bureau of Investigation spokesman John Bankhead told PolitiFact Georgia of two other recent deaths: Two chemicals used in synthetic marijuana were found in the system of a man, 43, who died Sept. 8 in Cherokee County. The official cause of death was chronic high blood pressure. Toxicology results are pending in the Feb. 20 death of a 26-year-old Clarke County man. Police found two packages of synthetic marijuana on his bathroom sink, one partially used. We found other accounts of synthetic marijuana-related deaths. For example, a South Carolina coroner ruled that it was directly responsible for the October death of a college basketball player who collapsed during warm-up, according to multiple news accounts. PolitiFact Georgia found less support for Deal’s claim about violence. We found no published studies on the subject. News stories, however, suggest there’s cause for concern. For instance: In September, a Bulloch County man told emergency dispatchers he and his girlfriend smoked Spice and it made him act "crazy," a sheriff’s report said. When deputies arrived, they found him holding his girlfriend, who was bloody and beaten. He said he attacked her. In 2010, an 18-year-old Iowa man fatally shot himself after smoking the drug. To sum up: Evidence supports Deal’s claim that use of the drug has "dramatically increased," as has synthetic marijuana-related "bodily harm." Some evidence suggests that deaths have risen, too. The link between the drug and violence is less clear. News accounts suggest there is an increase in both, but we found so few cases it’s hard to tell. Deal’s statement could use clarification. Still, it earns a Mostly True.	None	Nathan Deal	None	None	None	2012-04-09T06:00:00	2012-03-27	['None']
pomt-04745	"Mitt Romney’s platform ...won't protect the mortgage interest (tax) deduction for middle-class families."	mostly false	/georgia/statements/2012/aug/29/stephanie-cutter/stephanie-cutter-said-mitt-romneys-platform-wont-p/	The Obama campaign, to no one’s surprise, is highly critical of the Republican Party’s platform. In one email, Obama’s team offered several reasons for their disapproval, such as the Republicans will turn Medicare into a voucher program, they’ll ban marriage equality and reject civil unions of all kinds. But one claim about the GOP agenda and of its standard bearer, Mitt Romney, caught us off guard, particularly since it is so divergent from a Republican Party tenet. Obama deputy campaign manager Stephanie Cutter wrote in an email that Romney "won't protect the mortgage interest deduction for middle-class families if Romney enacts his tax plan, even though it helps more than 30 million middle-class families." Republicans generally support tax cuts. Could Cutter be right about this one? We contacted Obama campaign officials, who did not respond immediately respond to a request for comment. Generally, home mortgage interest is any interest you pay on a loan on your home or a second home. The loan may be a mortgage to buy your home, a second mortgage, a line of credit or a home equity loan. In most cases, you can deduct all of your home mortgage interest, according to the Internal Revenue Service. The mortgage interest deduction is a popular policy with millions of American homeowners, particularly middle-income earners. Nearly 50 percent of Americans who take advantage of the mortgage interest deduction make annual incomes between $100,000 and $200,000, according to the Tax Policy Center. As president, Ronald Reagan famously promised in a 1984 speech to the National Association of Realtors that he would "preserve the part of the American dream which the home mortgage interest deduction symbolizes." Some argue the deduction is the federal government’s way of paying Americans to buy a house. Over the years, there have been complaints that some wealthy Americans have abused the system, such as claiming deductions for yachts by claiming them as second homes. The Congressional Joint Committee on Taxation estimated in a 2010 report that the mortgage interest deduction will cost the federal government about $98.5 billion this fiscal year. Romney’s idea is that tax rates could be lowered if the tax code was scrubbed of loopholes and exemptions. That way, the government would get the same amount of tax revenue coming in. But Romney won’t say which loopholes and exemptions he would like to target. Democrats have argued that Romney’s tax plans would require him to make changes to the federal tax code, such as eliminating the mortgage interest deduction. The Tax Policy Center released an analysis of Romney’s tax plans that concluded Romney would raise taxes on middle-income Americans if he eliminated the mortgage interest deduction and ended other policies, such as the charitable deduction. The Wall Street Journal reported in April that Romney said at a fundraiser that he wants to stop allowing deductions on second homes. The Romney campaign later said the candidate was floating ideas and that it was not a firm proposal. Several news outlets reported earlier this month that the GOP was not going to support the mortgage interest deduction in its party platform. There was a battle over the deduction between the real estate industry, which wanted to keep it in the platform, and some conservative activists, who desired a simpler tax code, according to those reports. The Wall Street Journal later reported there was a compromise. The Republican Party platform lays out its position in a section called "Protecting The Taxpayers: ‘No More Too Big to Fail.’ " It says at the top of Page 25 that "we strongly support tax reform; in the event we do not achieve this, we must preserve the mortgage interest deduction." That wording does not explicitly back up Cutter's point. But it leaves open the possibility that eliminating the deduction could possibly be included in tax reform. Still, it's a stretch to conclude from that wording that Romney would eliminate the deduction. Our ruling Cutter said, "Mitt Romney's platform … won't protect the mortgage interest deduction for middle-class families." Romney wants to limit some tax deductions in exchange for rate cuts, but he hasn’t said which deductions he wants to end. The platform's general wording leaves open the possibility of changes to the deduction, but specifically expresses support for it. We rate Cutter’s claim as Mostly False.

pomt-12620	"President Trump just told Paul Ryan, ‘You’re fired.’"	pants on fire!	/wisconsin/statements/2017/apr/02/blog-posting/donald-trump-didnt-use-celebrity-apprentice-catchp/	PolitiFact Wisconsin examined the origins of this claim as part of the inaugural International Fact-Checking Day, April 2, 2017. Organizers at Poynter.org describe the day as "not a single event but a rallying cry for more facts -- and fact-checking -- in politics, journalism and everyday life." President Donald Trump and House Speaker Paul Ryan have had their differences ever since Trump emerged as the frontrunner for the 2016 Republican nomination. But once Trump won the election, Ryan has generally praised the former host of "The Celebrity Apprentice" TV show. And a major clash between the two GOP leaders certainly would lead the news. Yet we don’t recall a headline like this one in any mainstream news source: "BREAKING: President Trump Just Told Paul Ryan ‘You’re Fired.’" ("You’re fired" was Trump’s catchphrase on the show.) The headline was on an article posted on TheLastLineOfDefense.org on March 14, 2017 (10 days before the Republican plan to replace Obamacare collapsed, with some conservatives blaming Ryan). The site operators describe themselves as "a group of educated, God-fearing Christian conservative patriots." The headline and article were also posted the same day on a site called usanewspost.us, which presents an overlay of photos of scantily clad women when you go to its home page. But not on any other site that we could find -- much less a reputable news source. An aside, before we dig in: Roughly two-thirds of the statements made by bloggers that have been rated by PolitiFact have received a False or Pants on Fire. That includes a handful made by TheLastLineOfDefense.org. Its site carries a disclaimer that says its articles "may include information from sources that may or may not be reliable and facts that don’t necessarily exist. All articles should be considered satirical and any and all quotes attributed to actual people complete and total baloney." But you don't necessarily get that impression from any one article. In this case, the article begins by quoting a statement from "Jeff Derpinger at the WHOIP" as saying Trump "will no longer protect, defend or endorse anything the soon-to-be-former Speaker does, says or campaigns on. The betrayal of Paul Ryan and his subsequent dismissal as an advisor to the president and his upsoming (sic) loss in the election in 2018 is his own fault." We couldn’t find any connection between Trump’s White House and any person with that name or anything called WHOIP. The article, which doesn’t spell out what precipitated Trump’s alleged statement, ends by stating that Trump approached Ryan at a luncheon and told him: "Mr. Speaker, you’re fired." It goes without saying that if Trump had had such an encounter with Ryan, it would have been widely reported. One operator of TheLastLineOfDefense.org responded to our request for information to back up the statement by referring us to the site's disclaimer notice. In January 2017, BuzzFeed News reported that according to that man, identified as Zeke Wilekenmeyer, the site is "an elaborate trolling operation aimed at conservatives." Ryan press secretary Ian Martorana told us: "That headline is pure fiction." Our rating Bloggers said: "President Trump just told Paul Ryan, ‘You’re fired.’" No such statement has ever surfaced in the mainstream news media, only on a website that warns that much of its material is satirical.

pomt-03524	Since Gina Raimondo took office, investment fees on the state's pension portfolio "have gone up from about $12 million annually to about $50 million."	half-true	/rhode-island/statements/2013/jun/02/frank-caprio/ri-treasurer-candidate-frank-caprio-says-pension-i/	How much money should you spend to make money? That question, which every investor faces, has moved to the forefront in Rhode Island since the State Investment Commission, at the urging of General Treasurer Gina Raimondo, started moving 15 percent of state pension money into hedge funds. Those funds not only charge a very high fee for managing the account, they also collect a "performance" bonus -- often 20 to 25 percent -- from the profits. Raimondo's office says that's worth the price because hedge funds protect the pension fund from the type of drastic dip in value seen when the economy fell into a recession in 2008. Critics contend that investment expenses charged by those funds, combined with the risk they pose, make them a very bad choice. One such critic is Frank Caprio, who served as treasurer from 2007 through 2010 and, after an unsuccessful run for governor, is seeking his old job back. On the May 19 edition of the WJAR-TV program "10 News Conference," Caprio said he worked hard as treasurer to reduce the fees paid by the pension fund. "And lo and behold, after I left office, a national group did a study of all the pension funds. And Rhode Island ranked at the right end, the high end of that study, paying some of the lowest fees in the country, per capita," he said. "The fee structure of hedge funds is much different than index fund managers, which are the type of managers we had a lot of money with. So the fees have gone up from about $12 million annually to about $50 million," Caprio said. That's a big increase. We thought we'd check the numbers. We turned to both Raimondo's office and to Caprio. The former treasurer sent us the July 25, 2012, edition of the Maryland Policy Report, which ranked states based on the Wall Street fees they paid. For Rhode Island, it lists management fees of $13.1 million for the 2010 fiscal year. That's an expense ratio of $2.15 for every $1,000 invested. The U.S. average was $4.09 per $1,000. Only 10 other states paid a lower ratio. Raimondo's office, along with other documents, confirmed the $13.1 million figure, which is a bit higher than the "about $12 million" cited by Caprio. When we asked Caprio for the source of the $50 million comment, he referred us to minutes from the April 24, 2013, meeting of the state Investment Commission. Stephen Nesbitt, chief executive officer of Cliffwater LLC, one of the state's management consultants, is cited as saying that with the inclusion of performance fund hedge fees, the state is paying an expense ratio of 0.58 percent. That would be $5.80 for every $1,000 invested. Because the fund had $7.78 billion on April 30, that would equal $45.1 million in annual fees being paid, Caprio said. That's a bit lower than his "about $50 million." But these numbers don't begin to tell the whole story. The year cited by Caprio touting his own performance occurred during the financial crisis, when the value of the state's pension fund was depressed. For that reason alone, investment fees (also known as management and performance fees) would be lower. (The expense was $13.1 million for 2010, but it was $20.3 million the previous year and $28.6 million the year before that. Caprio said the big 2010 reduction "was not because of market going down. My team moved over $2 billion out of active money managers who charged high fees to index funds that charge low fees.") Raimondo's office contends that such direct fees are actually lower under her current administration -- $12.7 million during the last fiscal year and $15.1 million the year before that. (Management fees cover the basic services for handling an account. They are calculated based on a percentage of what the fund is worth and paid whether the value of the fund has risen or fallen.) Yet it gets even more complicated. The direct management fees charged by traditional investments are only a small part of the actual cost of administering the state's portfolio. Other types of investments, such as those hedge funds, charge indirect fees, which are removed from the fund balance before it is reported, making them harder to compile. Hedge funds charge both an indirect management fee and an indirect performance fee, which is typically about 20 percent of the fund's profit, assessed annually. The total for the fees paid under Raimondo has tripled because the current treasurer, for the first time, has begun reporting both direct and indirect fees. It's one of only six states doing so, according to Cliffwater. How much are we talking about? In May, Raimondo's office released an accounting of all investment expenses for the fiscal year that ended June 30, 2012. They totaled $46 million, including staff expenses; $32.5 million of that went for indirect fund expenses and $13.5 million for direct fees. How high were the indirect expenses during the year Caprio was paying out $13.1 million in direct expenses? That's hard to tease out because they haven't been reported, and few states do. The bottom line: Raimondo contends they were higher than Caprio stated. Caprio disagrees. We can’t determine who’s right because they weren’t reported in past years. Our ruling Frank Caprio said that since Gina Raimondo took office, investment fees on the state's pension portfolio "have gone up from about $12 million annually to about $50 million." State records show that, at first blush, the numbers were $13.1 million in 2010 and $46.0 million now. He's not on the money, but close. But it's not clear if Caprio has given a complete accounting of his expenses for fiscal 2010. Both Caprio and Raimondo say some data is unavailable for that year, so that element of truth remains unresolved. Because Caprio's comparison is partially accurate but lacks important details and elements of context, we rate it Half True.

pomt-03713	"We Really Do Have the Highest Corporate Tax Rate in the World."	mostly true	/georgia/statements/2013/apr/17/tax-foundation/group-takes-senator-about-corporate-taxes/	Mid-April, despite the warmer weather, is a dreaded time for many Georgians. It’s the worst of allergy season. Pollen, go away! It’s also time to settle up with Uncle Sam. Monday was the deadline to file income taxes. Against that backdrop, PolitiFact Georgia thought it’d be worthwhile to examine an often-repeated claim about corporate taxes that again made the rounds as April 15 approached. U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., was recently on the HBO late-night program "Real Time with Bill Maher." The senator and Wall Street Journal editorial board member Stephen Moore were debating whether the United States has the highest corporate tax rate in the world. Moore: "We have the highest corporate tax rate in the world, senator." Sanders: "No we do not." Moore: "Yes we do. Thirty-five percent. The Tax Foundation says the United States of America has the highest corporate tax rate." Sanders: "And who funds the National (sic) Tax Foundation?" Maher: "Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!" The Tax Foundation defended its research in a news release and an open letter to Sanders a few days later. "Yes, Sen. Sanders," the headline read, "We Really Do Have the Highest Corporate Tax Rate in the World." The foundation posted nearly the same message on Twitter. The foundation said that as of April 2012 the United States had the highest corporate tax rate in the developed world. The U.S. rate is 35 percent, but many say it’s even higher (39 percent) once you include other factors. Japan previously laid claim to that title, the foundation and other news organizations said, but it lowered its rate last year by a few percentage points. The decrease varies, depending on the news source, but all now put Japan below the U.S.A. Here’s the foundation’s 2012 list of the top three nations with the highest corporate tax rates, excluding Japan: United States 39.1 France 34.4 Belgium 34.0 The foundation’s numbers include a weighed average of state corporate taxes. The Washington, D.C.-based, nonpartisan foundation celebrated its 75th anniversary last year. America’s high corporate tax rate was an issue during the 2012 presidential race. President Barack Obama proposed lowering the federal rate to 25 percent for manufacturers and to 28 percent for all other corporations. Republican nominee Mitt Romney wanted to lower the rate to 25 percent for all corporations. A major complaint about America’s tax system is it is too complicated. Examining corporate tax rates is complex. For example, Sanders said the U.S. may have the highest nominal tax rate, but it is not the highest effective tax rate. The effective tax rate takes into consideration deductions and exemptions. The foundation also discussed the effective tax rate in its letter to the senator. "Even when including all deductions and credits available to companies to lower their tax liabilities, the ‘effective’ tax rate of U.S. corporations is still among the very highest in the world. The most recent studies show a U.S. effective corporate tax rate of roughly 27 percent, compared to an average of 20 percent for other developed countries," the foundation wrote. A few larger corporations pay no net federal income tax at all, some research shows. PolitiFact Texas recently tackled the question when a Texas congressman said the U.S. had the highest corporate tax rate in the world in a voter’s guide. The congressman, Michael McCaul, used information from the Tax Foundation to support his claim. PolitiFact Texas, citing the various reports about effective tax rates, gave the claim a Mostly True. We asked Tax Foundation spokesman Richard Morrison whether there was any additional information or context that might be useful for our research. Morrison said the information McCaul used appeared to be up to date. To sum up, the Tax Foundation said the United States has the highest corporate taxes in the world. The organization did mention the debate about where the U.S. stands if you consider effective rates. Some say that context lowers America’s standing from Numero Uno, but not by much. We rate this claim Mostly True.	None	The Tax Foundation	None	None	None	2013-04-17T00:00:00	2013-04-12	['None']
pomt-14334	"This unit is the only one in the state that strives to implement the principles of Mother-Friendly care as outlined by the national Coalition for Improving Maternity Services Mother-Friendly Childbirth Initiative."	false	/rhode-island/statements/2016/mar/27/coalition-save-memorial-hospital-birthing-center-p/memorial-not-alone-mother-friendly-births/	When Care New England announced its plan to eliminate some of Memorial Hospital’s services, including the obstetrics unit, it ignited an emotional debate about birthing in Rhode Island. The Health Department heard hours of testimony from mothers and nurses rallying around Memorial Hospital. But few voices have been stronger than those from the Coalition To Save Memorial Hospital Birthing Center. At the first hearing, held at Goff Junior High School in Pawtucket on March 13, Coalition leader Alana Bibeau, a sociology professor at the University of Rhode Island, praised the Memorial unit for its dedication to care for mothers. "This unit is the only one in the state that strives to implement the principles of Mother-Friendly care as outlined by the national Coalition for Improving Maternity Services Mother-Friendly Childbirth Initiative," Bibeau said in her remarks. We had never heard of the "Mother-Friendly Childbirth Initiative," but the title sounded official. Maybe it was the capital letters? We called Bibeau, and asked her for more information. What does it mean to be "Mother-Friendly?" Bibeau pointed us to the Coalition for Improving Maternity Services’ website. Here we found a list of 10 steps that hospitals, birth centers or home birth services can take to be more "mother-friendly." On this list are general recommendations such as allowing the mother to choose her own birth companions, and allowing her to walk around, eat and drink during labor. There are also more specific items regarding the use of IVs, membranes, and the use of analgesic or anesthetic drugs. "Birth is a normal physiological process, not a medical emergency," Bibeau said in a telephone interview. "Most hospitals view each woman as a potential candidate for surgery." All of the steps, she said, lead to the ultimate goal of natural birth, with little to no intervention by doctors. A woman should be able to identify a birth plan with her doctor and stick to it, she said. (Bibeau did acknowledge that birth can take some "very unexpected" turns, and there may be medical need to deviate from the steps). That all makes sense, but could Memorial Hospital really be the only one in the state striving toward these principles? We asked Victoria Macioce-Stumpf — a doula from Michigan who also serves as a chair of the coalition that supposedly provides this designation — if she could provide a list of all "Mother-Friendly" certified hospitals. She could not, she said, because no such list exists. The Coalition for Improving Maternity Services does not have a formal certification process for hospitals. Rather, she said facilities are only "highly encouraged" to take the steps outlined on its website. "There is a great deal of rigorous work as well as money" that must be spent to create a [certification] program of this type, she wrote in an email. "Something we have not as yet had the means or manpower to initiate." Rhode Island does not certify hospitals as "Mother-Friendly," either. Nor does the state endorse these principles for their birthing units. But "this is not to say, of course, that we don’t believe that there is merit to some of their commitments," said Joseph Wendelken, public information officer for the Rhode Island Department of Health. The Rhode Island Department of Health has licensed six hospitals for childbirth: Kent, Landmark, Newport, South County, Women & Infants and Memorial (for now). All of these facilities, Wendelken said, are "held to extremely high standards" set at the national level by The Joint Commission, a nonprofit organization that accredits hospitals. About 90 percent of Rhode Island babies are born at Care New England facilities, according to Angelleen Peters-Lewis, a chief nurse for the group. Women & Infants delivers on average 8,400 babies a year, Kent 1,200 babies, and Memorial less than 500, Peters-Lewis said. We also asked officials at Newport Hospital, South County Hospital, and Landmark Medical Center. Many had not heard of the "Mother-Friendly" standards, but they all agreed that the principles are practiced in their facilities. Jackie Toole, a staff RN at South County Hospital, said she follows these steps every day. Danika Wynn, the director of Landmark’s midwifery program, said the hospital "strives to build a maternity-care culture that mirrors Memorial’s," and in doing so, meets many of the The Coalition for Improving Maternity Services standards. Same goes for Denise Sullivan, the director of women’s health and newborn services at Newport Hospital. "We try to keep the patient in the middle of our circle," Sullivan said. "So we are trying to let the mother work with the health care team to get the kind of birth that she wants." Sullivan also pointed out that her hospital is "Baby-Friendly" certified, a UNICEF and World Health Organization distinction for taking steps to encourage breast feeding. Women & Infants is also "Baby-Friendly." Memorial Hospital has not attained that certification. We asked Bibeau about this, and she referred us to Kaeli Sutton, another leader of the coalition to save memorial hospital. "While other maternity institutions verbally state their philosophical commitment to the MFCI, the Coalition sees no credible evidence that they have committed the necessary time, financial resources, policy development and staff training necessary to claim true alignment with the Initiative," she wrote in an email. OUR RULING: Bibeau said Memorial Hospital’s birthing center is the only Rhode Island center that strives to accomplish the goals set out by the "Mother-Friendly Childbirth Initiative" from the national Coalition for Improving Maternity Services Mother-Friendly Childbirth Initiative. Bibeau said Memorial Hospital’s birthing center is the only Rhode Island center that strives to accomplish the goals set out by the "Mother-Friendly Childbirth Initiative" from the national Coalition for Improving Maternity Services Mother-Friendly Childbirth Initiative. Not only does the Coalition for Improving Maternity Services not review and certify facilities, but all of the other birthing centers in the state say these principles are standard practice at their hospitals. The Coalition to Save Memorial Hospital Birthing Center got back to us Friday. A spokeswoman said: "the Coalition sees no credible evidence that [other hospitals in Rhode Island] have committed the necessary time, financial resources, policy development and staff training necessary to claim true alignment with the Initiative." At the end of the week, the coalition changed its position from a statement of fact to an opinion about the other hospitals' "true alignment." We rate the original claim False.

pomt-05767	Says "half the Americans don't pay any income taxes."	true	/new-jersey/statements/2012/feb/29/scott-garrett/congressman-scott-garrett-claims-half-all-american/	The deadline for filing one’s federal income tax return is fast approaching, but according to U.S. Rep. Scott Garrett, half of the nation won’t pay any money to the government. The Sussex County Republican claimed during a Feb. 15 interview on WOR-AM that half of all Americans don’t pay federal income taxes. After discussing the federal budget, Garrett cited that statistic when host John Gambling pointed out the economic turmoil unfolding in Greece. Garrett (R-5th Dist.) responded, "That’s the absurd situation they’ve got over there where the average person on the street relied so heavily on the government for his livelihood, for his well-being. We don’t want to be in that situation in this country, but we’re getting close to it, when half the Americans don’t pay any income taxes." PolitiFact New Jersey found that Garrett is right, according to research done by two nonpartisan groups. Both groups confirm that about half of all American households do not have to pay any federal income taxes. Our PolitiFact colleagues around the country have tackled similar statements a few times before and reached the same conclusion. First, let’s explain the data that supports Garrett’s claim. To back up the congressman’s point, Garrett spokesman Ben Veghte directed us to a July 2011 report from the Urban Institute-Brookings Institution Tax Policy Center. In that report, the center estimated that about 46 percent of "tax units" would pay no federal income tax for 2011 -- the most current estimate available. The center had estimated that 49.5 percent of tax units didn’t pay federal income taxes for 2010. A tax unit is an individual or married couple that either files a tax return or would have to file one if their income was high enough, Roberton Williams, a senior fellow with the center, said in an e-mail. In other words, a tax unit is roughly equivalent to a household, he said. Of the 46.4 percent of units not paying income taxes for 2011, about half was due to the fact that those units had no taxable income after subtracting the standard deduction and personal exemptions, Williams said. "The other half qualified for various exclusions, itemized deductions, special exemptions, preferential tax rates, and tax credits that wiped out any tax liability," Williams told us. That second group includes tax units benefiting from education and child credits. Now, let’s talk about the other group backing up Garrett’s statistic. In April 2011, the Joint Committee on Taxation, a nonpartisan committee of Congress, released an analysis estimating that slightly more than 50 percent of all tax units would owe no federal income taxes for 2009. Of those tax units, about 22 percent would have a zero income tax liability and about 30 percent would actually get money back from the government, according to the committee. So, both groups support Garrett’s claim that roughly half of all American households pay no federal income taxes. Our ruling In a radio interview, Garrett claimed "half the Americans don’t pay any income taxes." That claim is backed up by research from two nonpartisan groups -- the Tax Policy Center and the Joint Committee on Taxation. Both groups have estimated that about half of all American households did not owe federal income taxes in recent years. We rate the statement True. To comment on this ruling, go to NJ.com.

pomt-10030	"The president campaigned against this type of legislation."	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/mar/02/john-boehner/spending-bill-wasnt-candidate-obamas-type-boehner-/	Speaking on the House floor, Republican Leader John Boehner railed against a spending bill with some 9,000 earmarks, calling on President Obama to veto it and insist on one free of pet projects. "The president campaigned against this type of legislation, this number of earmarks," the Ohio Republican said on Feb. 25, "and I would hope that the president would veto this bill because Republicans in Congress will be here to uphold his veto of this piece of legislation." Several news organizations made even harsher claims. The New York Times , for example, reported that Obama would sign the bill, earmarks and all, "despite campaign promises to put an end to the practice." That's incorrect. Obama did not promise to end earmarking, only to "reform" it, and eliminate "screwy" or wasteful earmarks. Boehner, however, was more careful than the New York Times. His claim that Obama "campaigned against this type of legislation" could be read a number of ways. Boehner's spokesman, Michael Steel, said Boehner meant that Obama had broken his campaign pledges, referenced on the White House Web site , to "slash earmarks to no greater than 1994 levels and ensure all spending decisions are open to the public." That's a reasonable interpretation of what Boehner said. Obama did indeed make those pledges during the campaign. Sen. John McCain, the Republican candidate, pledged to eliminate earmarks and "veto every earmark pork-barrel bill," and Obama, though stopping short of that, did pledge to get tough on them. For example, here's Obama in the first presidential debate : "Absolutely, we need earmark reform. And when I'm president, I will go line by line to make sure that we are not spending money unwisely." On March 10, 2008, Obama said in a statement : "We can no longer accept a process that doles out earmarks based on a member of Congress' seniority, rather than the merit of the project. We can no longer accept an earmarks process that has become so complicated to navigate that a municipality or nonprofit group has to hire high-priced D.C. lobbyists to do it. And we can no longer accept an earmarks process in which many of the projects being funded fail to address the real needs of our country." And here he is on Feb. 21, 2008 : "I have been consistently in favor of more disclosure around earmarks. Now, keep in mind a lot of these are worthy projects in our states, and I have actively pursued projects that I think are important. But I want to make sure that they're not done in the dark of night, that they're not done in committee, that everybody stands up and says this is the kind of spending that I think is important." The closest he came to saying he would eliminate earmarks, as far as we could find, was when he said, in the third presidential debate , "Earmarks account for 0.5 percent of the total federal budget. There's no doubt that the system needs reform and there are a lot of screwy things that we end up spending money on, and they need to be eliminated. But it's not going to solve the problem." (Given his other campaign statements on earmarks, it's clear he meant "screwy," or wasteful, earmarks should be eliminated, not all earmarks.) So the question is, is the omnibus spending bill the "type of legislation" that Obama campaigned against with respect to earmarks? That is, did it lack transparency, include earmarks based on a congressman's seniority and ones that are wasteful? And was the amount more than the 1994 level of $7.8 billion a year? The answer to most of those questions is largely yes, said Keith Ashdown, investigator for Taxpayers for Common Sense, a Washington watchdog group. Ashdown said the earmarking process for the omnibus bill was not any more transparent than it was when Obama was campaigning. He said seven of the top 10 earmark recipients in the Senate are on the Appropriations Committee, suggesting that access was more important than merit when it came to deciding what projects would get earmarks. And though the total cost of the earmarks in the bill, $7.7 billion, is slightly less than the 1994 level, there were another $6.6 billion in earmarks in three previous spending bills for this year that Congress passed last year. Are there wasteful projects in the bill? Ashdown said he hasn't had time to research that. "There likely is, but I just don't know," he said. He cautioned against leaping to conclusions about projects that "sound goofy." For example, some critics have mocked a $1 million earmark to control Mormon crickets in Utah — but Ashdown said the Mormon cricket, a type of katydid, is a very serious threat to agriculture. The White House has argued that Obama should not be held responsible for the earmarking process in this legislative package — which is nine of the 12 spending bills for the current budget year rolled into one — because it is "last year's business." And there's some truth to that. These are bills that Congress was supposed to pass last year. But that doesn't nullify Boehner's point that the bill is — in featuring earmarks added by senior members of Congress in a process that lacked transparency and pushed earmark spending for the year well over $7.8 billion — the "type of legislation" Obama campaigned against. We find Boehner's claim to be True.	None	John Boehner	None	None	None	2009-03-02T19:08:08	2009-02-25	['None']
pomt-06261	Says Mitt Romney flip-flopped on abortion.	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/nov/28/democratic-national-committee/dnc-ad-says-mitt-romney-flip-flopped-abortion/	On Nov. 28, 2011, the Democratic National Committee released two videos designed to paint Republican presidential candidate and former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney as a serial flip-flopper. The shorter, 30-second version gives a taste of the attack, specifically citing abortion and health care, and directs viewers to a website with a four-minute version that offers alleged flip-flops on a variety of other issues. For this item, we’ll check one of the two claims from the 30-second version -- whether Romney has changed his position on abortion. We'll look at other aspects of the ad in separate items. Romney, unlike the other GOP contenders, has attracted early attention from the re-election campaign of President Barack Obama, largely due to Romney’s status as the nominal frontrunner in the GOP primary. But Romney has faced years of accusations about being a flip-flopper, most recently in a television ad by one of his primary rivals, former Utah Gov. Jon Huntsman. We checked Huntsman’s abortion-related charges from that ad, so we’ll recap them here. First, let’s look at some of the things Romney said earlier in his career about abortion, when he was waging a losing bid for a U.S. Senate seat in Massachusetts and winning the governorship a few years later. Here are two of the clearest statements of his position. • In a debate during his 1994 race against Democratic Sen. Edward Kennedy, Romney said, "I believe that abortion should be safe and legal in this country." Referring to the 1973 Supreme Court decision that made abortion legal in every state, Romney added, "I believe that since Roe v. Wade has been the law for 20 years, it should be sustained and supported. And I sustain and support that law and support the right of a woman to make that choice." • In his 2002 campaign for governor, Romney said during a debate, "I will preserve and protect a woman's right to choose and am devoted and dedicated to honoring my word in that regard." We believe that these two comments -- made in highly public forums and eight years apart -- represent pretty solid evidence that Romney was an abortion-rights supporter during that phase of his political career. What about his views today? The "issues" portion of his website doesn’t list abortion, but Romney wrote a June 18, 2011, op-ed in the conservative National Review that lays out his abortion views pretty clearly. It was written after he risked alienating anti-abortion activists by declining to sign a pledge offered by the Susan B. Anthony List, an anti-abortion group. "I am pro-life and believe that abortion should be limited to only instances of rape, incest, or to save the life of the mother. I support the reversal of Roe v. Wade, because it is bad law and bad medicine. Roe was a misguided ruling that was a result of a small group of activist federal judges legislating from the bench. I support the Hyde Amendment, which broadly bars the use of federal funds for abortions. And as president, I will support efforts to prohibit federal funding for any organization like Planned Parenthood, which primarily performs abortions or offers abortion-related services. "I will reinstate the Mexico City Policy to ensure that nongovernmental organizations that receive funding from America refrain from performing or promoting abortion services as a method of family planning, in other countries. This includes ending American funding for any United Nations or other foreign assistance program that promotes or performs abortions on women around the world. "I will advocate for and support a Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act to protect unborn children who are capable of feeling pain from abortion. And perhaps most importantly, I will only appoint judges who adhere to the Constitution and the laws as they are written, not as they want them to be written." Our ruling Abortion opponents may disagree on exactly where on the anti-abortion spectrum Romney falls, and questions have been raised about how fully and quickly Romney made his ideological transition after the event he cites as the spark -- a meeting with a Harvard stem-cell researcher in 2004. Still, we believe these issues are outside the scope of the claim in the DNC ad. Romney’s views on abortion are vastly different today than what he expressed in the 1994 and 2002 debates. The DNC’s claim that Mitt Romney flip-flopped on abortion rates a True.	None	Democratic National Committee	None	None	None	2011-11-28T13:59:12	2011-11-28	['None']
pomt-08588	"If you look at the application for a security clearance, I have a clearance that even the president of the United States cannot obtain because of my background."	pants on fire!	/florida/statements/2010/sep/24/allen-west/allen-west-says-he-has-clearance-even-president-un/	During a candidate forum sponsored by the Pompano, Fla., Civic Association on Sept. 21, 2010, Allen West -- a retired Army lieutenant colonel running as the Republican nominee against Democratic Rep. Ron Klein -- made a rather striking claim. West was responding to a question about tax liens that had allegedly been placed against him -- an issue that had already inspired a hard-hitting ad by Klein. According to a video made by a Democratic Party operative who trails West at all of his appearances, the candidate told the audience, "I had a Top Secret/Security Compartmented Information classification, that is the highest you can have in the United States Army. You don’t get a security classification like that if you have financial issues like that. I still retain a Secret security clearance. And I tell you, if you look at the application for a security clearance, I have a clearance that even the president of the United States cannot obtain because of my background." We've already addressed questions about the lien (we rated Klein's ad Mostly True). But we wondered whether it was really possible for someone -- anyone -- to have a higher security clearance than the president. So we asked a few experts. First, some background on security clearances. There are three levels, in ascending order: Confidential, Secret and Top Secret. There are many subcategories, but the only one that is relevant here is an elite category of Top Secret called Top Secret/Sensitive Compartmented information, or TS/SCI. It is for people who have Top Secret clearances but who may, in order to do their jobs, need to know certain information that is especially sensitive, such as sources and methods of intelligence-gathering. A TS/SCI clearance allows them to know the information they need, but it is not a blanket clearance for all extremely sensitive information. That's why it's called "compartmented." West mentioned TS/SCI in his comments at the Pompano Civic Association, though he got the name slightly wrong, calling it "Top Secret/Security Compartmented Information." To be picky, West would have had a TS/SCI clearance, rather than "classification" -- people have clearances, documents have classifications. We inquired with the Pentagon about his clearance but weren't able to get an answer Friday night. Experts we spoke to said that it was plausible for someone like West to have a TS/SCI clearance, so for the purposes of this fact-check, we'll assume he had that level. As you'll see below, his actual level wouldn't change our conclusion. Our experts also said that it's plausible that West would still have a Secret clearance today. Since retired officers can be called back to duty, and because many of them do consulting work for the military or for companies that work with the military, it's common for retired officers to maintain a security clearance. But what about him having "a clearance that even the president of the United States cannot obtain"? We see at least two ways to look at this claim. The first is that West is saying that he had a higher security clearance than someone occupying the office of president of the United States. Even if you assume that he was referring to the period in which West held a TS/SCI, our experts say he's wrong. "The president is the one who established the security clearance system by executive order," said Steven Aftergood, a national security and intelligence specialist with the Federation of American Scientists. "Therefore it is nonsensical to speak of clearances higher than what the president has. As head of the executive branch and commander in chief of the armed forces, there is no information in government that could be denied to the president for security reasons if he determined he needed access to that information." John Pike, the director of globalsecurity.org, agreed. "This is a silly statement," Pike said. "The only clearance the president needs is the mandate of the people." The statement is even more questionable if West was actually referring to what he says is his current clearance -- Secret. "A Secret security clearance is the most commonly held security clearance," Aftergood said. "Almost anyone without a criminal record or serious financial difficulties can get such a clearance if their employment requires it." There's one more possible interpretation, and when we reached the West campaign, they said this is indeed what the candidate meant at the forum. As a career military officer, West went through a rigorous screening and investigatory process in order to receive his TS/SCI clearance. President Barack Obama got his authority by virtue of a popular vote. There is no security process required before one becomes president. If, in theory, Obama was not president and decided to apply for a security clearance, there's no guarantee he'd qualify for one. He'd have to go through a painstaking process, and investigators may raise any number of questions. "The fact that (Obama) admitted to cocaine use, travel to unauthorized countries years before, and his associations with (black nationalist) Louis Farrakhan and Rev. Jeremiah Wright, he probably would not have been granted a security clearance," said Josh Grodin, West's campaign manager. This argument does at least have a grain of validity to it. But we see some problems with it. During the presidential campaign, a similar claim was floated by some Obama opponents. One chain e-mail alleged that "if Barack Obama would apply for a job with the FBI or with the Secret Service, he would be disqualified because of his past associations with William Ayers, a known (and unrepentant) terrorist." We ruled it False. Pike said that the one thing in Obama's background that could raise a flag for someone doing a security check is "his unaccompanied foreign travel for an extended period of time." Still, he added, "the tender age at which Obama traveled abroad would almost certainly render this irrelevant, particularly in light of everything else he has done." To the extent that West has already been cleared by national-security vetters, and Obama has not, we think West may have a small point. Still, even using this logic, West oversteps when he says that his own clearance is one "that even the president of the United States cannot obtain." We don't believe the evidence suggests that it's an open-and-shut case that Obama would be denied the kind of security clearance West had. And that's the most plausible interpretation of West's comment. The other interpretation -- that West's clearance, either today or in the past -- was higher than any president's is ridiculously false. The president has the highest security clearance in the land. We rate West's claim Pants on Fire.	None	Allen West	None	None	None	2010-09-24T18:28:50	2010-09-21	['United_States']
pomt-09795	Health insurance companies pay CEOs $24 million a year	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/sep/16/health-care-america-now/health-care-advocacy-group-blasts-insurers-ceo-pay/	Supporters of health care reform have portrayed insurance company CEOs as overpaid villains. In a recent television ad, Health Care for America Now, a group supporting the Democrats' health care reform bill, takes direct aim at the CEOs. The group's ad mockingly explains "how to get rich" by showing a "book" written "by America's health insurance companies." Chapter 2 reads, "Pay your CEO $24,000,000 a year." A news release issued by HCAN attributed the assertion to the entry for Ronald A. Williams, CEO of insurance giant Aetna, in the 2008 Forbes magazine executive compensation survey. We checked Forbes , which compiles the total compensation from public filings of salaries and stock options, and the $24 million figure does indeed jibe with the entry the group cited. But we wondered whether it was fair to use Williams as an example of health insurance CEOs. So we looked through the magazine's full rankings for a bit more context. One thing to note up front is that HCAN used Forbes ' 2008 survey, even though the 2009 survey is available. Oddly, if the group had used the more recent numbers, Williams' compensation would actually have been higher: In the 2009 Forbes survey, Williams' compensation was listed as $38.125 million. That said, Williams' pay package was easily the highest in the health insurance sector, according to Forbes . Here are seven health insurance CEOs who made the 2009 Forbes list. (All lead publicly traded companies, which have more stringent disclosure requirements than private firms.) -- 22nd place among all CEOs: Ronald A. Williams, Aetna, $38.125 million -- 135th place: H. Edward Hanway, Cigna, $10.27 million -- 269th place: Stephen J. Hemsley, UnitedHealth Group, $5.035 million -- 306th place: Angela F. Braly, WellPoint, $4.07 million -- 359th place: Robert B. Pollock, Assurant, $3.14 million -- 387th place: Allen F. Wise, Coventry Health Care, $2.6 million -- 399th place: Michael B. McCallister, Humana, $2.39 million The average for the other six executives above was $3.93 million — almost one-tenth of what Williams was paid. So it's clear that HCAN has chosen the highest-paid CEO for its purposes. We should note that executive compensation is notoriously complicated to calculate, since it often includes a mix of salary, benefits, deferred compensation and stock options. Indeed, different sources reported the same CEO pay package differently. For instance, the current listing on Yahoo! Finance has Williams' salary at $3.04 million with no stock options — a number that would have made HCAN's ad highly misleading. However, for the sake of consistency, we will stick with the Forbes methodology. We won't venture an opinion on whether these CEOs' salaries are merited, but we did talk to one expert who provided some cross-industry context: Graef Crystal, a veteran consultant and analyst on executive compensation who is also a columnist for Bloomberg News. In a recent column inspired by congressional Democrats' denunciations of the health insurance sector, Crystal offered some calculations designed to gauge whether CEOs in the health insurance sector were overpaid or underpaid compared to executives in other sectors. Crystal's math is complicated, but the bottom line is that when he looked at compensation for the five biggest health insurers' CEOs in 2007 and 2008, Williams' pay package was the only one of that group that in both years was bigger than the typical compensation package for CEOs throughout all the industries Crystal studied. Most of the other health insurance CEOs were paid 15 percent to 81 percent below the typical level calculated by Crystal. In other words, Williams was the one health insurance CEO who has consistently been paid on the highest end of the scale. The ad leaves viewers with the impression that $24-million is a typical compensation for a health insurer's CEO. But in fact, it is the highest example and the average of the others is considerably lower — just under $4 million. So HCAN has certainly cherry-picked the most dramatic number. We find the claim Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.

pomt-00594	The runnerup to Caitlyn Jenner for ESPN’s Arthur Ashe Courage Award was "Army veteran Noah Galloway, who lost an arm and leg to a roadside bomb in Iraq."	pants on fire!	/punditfact/statements/2015/jun/04/facebook-posts/no-iraq-veteran-wasnt-runnerup-caitlyn-jenner-espn/	On Monday, Vanity Fair introduced the world to Caitlyn Jenner. That same day, ESPN announced it would honor Jenner, the transgender gold medal-winning Olympian formerly named Bruce, with the Arthur Ashe Courage Award. The presentation is scheduled for July 15 at ESPN’s awards show, The ESPYs. "Bruce has received many accolades over the years for being one of the greatest Olympians of our time but The ESPYS are honored to celebrate Bruce becoming Caitlyn," said ESPN executive producer Maura Mandt. "She has shown the courage to embrace a truth that had been hidden for years, and to embark on a journey that may not only give comfort to those facing similar circumstances, but can also help to educate people on the challenges that the transgender community faces." That didn’t sit well with many people, who thought there were more deserving winners. Some thought Lauren Hill, a 19-year-old college basketball player who died of cancer, should have won. A Facebook meme, meanwhile, said the runnerup was an Iraq war veteran who lost his arm and leg defending the United States. When last we looked, it had been shared more than 100,000 times. Here it is: "Caitlyn Jenner won the Arthur Ashe Courage Award," it reads. "The runner-up was this guy: Army veteran Noah Galloway, who lost an arm and leg to a roadside bomb in Iraq, and now competes in Crossfit events, runs marathons and competed in the 58-hour Death Race." People are obviously free to debate who should have been selected, whether it’s Galloway, Hill, Jenner or any number of athletes. But the idea that Galloway was runnerup to Jenner is bunk. In a statement provided to MTV News, ESPN said there was no runnerup. There is "no such thing as a runnerup for the three major awards," a spokesman told MTV, referring to the Arthur Ashe Courage Award, the Pat Tillman Award for Service and the Jimmy V Perseverance Award. ESPN put out a follow-up statement on the Arthur Ashe Courage Award two days after announcing Jenner as the recipient. It reads: "The Arthur Ashe Courage Award is meant to honor individuals whose contributions transcend sports through courageous action. Sometimes that courage is demonstrated over the course of a lifetime and sometimes it is demonstrated in a single act that shines a light on an important contemporary issue. At all times, there are many worthy candidates. This year, we are proud to honor Caitlyn Jenner embracing her identity and doing so in a public way to help move forward a constructive dialogue about progress and acceptance." Several websites, from Snopes, to Deadspin to the Washington Post, have reached the same conclusion as PunditFact: Galloway is a real person, but this runnerup story is bogus.

pomt-12217	Says Paul Ryan "has not had a public town hall within the district for over 600 days."	mostly true	/wisconsin/statements/2017/jul/21/randy-bryce/challenger-target-claim-paul-ryan-has-gone-600-day/	One of House Speaker Paul Ryan’s 2018 challengers has risen to prominence with a flurry of media interviews, a viral campaign launch video and a quick influx of small-dollar donations. In one of those interviews, Democrat Randy Bryce claimed Ryan, a Republican from Janesville, doesn’t face his constituents. Bryce, an ironworker, appeared July 9, 2017, on WISN-TV’s "Upfront with Mike Gousha," where he claimed "Paul Ryan has not had a public town hall within the district for over 600 days." With Republicans facing feisty constituents at town hall meetings across the country, has Ryan really not held such a meeting in more than 600 days? What makes a town hall? Just what is a town hall meeting? The answer in the digital age can vary. A look through Ryan’s U.S. House website indicates that the last public, in-person town hall meeting he held was on Oct. 6, 2015, shortly before he was elected Speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives. Thus, Ryan has gone more than 650 days without holding a similar town hall meeting. That’s where the different definitions come in. David Keith, a spokesman for Bryce, cited a reference.com Q&A that defines a town hall as an informal, in-person meeting between citizens and public figures. "Many modern town halls are held in locations that are accessible to the public and can accommodate large crowds," the site reads. Historically, town halls are in-person, informal events where people can ask public officials unscripted questions. The Merriam-Webster and Oxford dictionaries’ definitions and usage examples both have a physical connotation. In recent years, Ryan has opted for office hours, telephone town halls and employee town halls -- those done at workplaces. Indeed, the information cited by Bryce from reference.com relies in part on the nonpartisan Congress Management Foundation, which has been looking into the effects of in-person, online and telephone town halls. The foundation conducts research into the evolving methods to host town halls and their comparative effectiveness. Ryan spokesman Ian Martorana said the speaker considers telephone and employee town halls to be forms of public town hall meetings and said telephone town halls make up a significant portion of Ryan’s interactions with constituents. Martorana said they conduct telephone town halls by calling "every household with a registered voter in the pertinent counties whose contact information we have and who reside in Wisconsin's First District." He added: "The calls are not screened, and they are answered in the order they are received." Employee town halls are another matter. These are typically hosted by private businesses where the audience is usually pre-selected, and so are their questions. The public is largely barred from these events, and reporters are usually unable to ask questions. Ryan recently held two employee town halls while Congress was on break for the Fourth of July holiday, visiting businesses in Oak Creek and Racine. Audience members offered Ryan a series of friendly questions. "If you had to make a decision between attending an October regular season Packers game or a Brewers World Series game, which one?" one person asked, according to a CBS news article. The day after he visited those businesses, Ryan took questions from reporters at the state Capitol where he said he was looking for "creative ways" to interact with constituents, instead of traditional town hall meetings. Ryan also said he was thinking of safety, trying to avoid a "screaming fest" from protesters bused into his district and that having reporters at events limits the conversation. "I find when you guys are there, people tend to clam up," Ryan told reporters on July 7, 2017. Ryan did hold a number of campaign events the day before his 2016 primary election that he billed as town halls -- though they did not match the framework of his last in-person listening session. Reports and a video from the event indicate that it was much more in keeping with the employee town halls meetings. And as campaign events, they had a different purpose than a traditional town hall. Past criticism Ryan has been criticized in the past for not being accessible to his constituents. In February 2017, the left-leaning group Forward Kenosha organized a mock town hall at a union hall where constituents posed questions to an empty chair. In May, U.S. Rep. Mark Pocan (D-Madison) held a town hall in Ryan’s district. Martorana said Ryan’s office has issued 60,000 responses this year to constituents who have contacted the office by phone, email, fax or letter. He added that recent telephone town halls reached more than 13,000 constituents in Walworth, Rock, Kenosha and Racine counties. In contrast, U.S. Rep. Jim Sensenbrenner ( R-Wis.), the dean of the state’s congressional delegation, has not shied away from open town halls, sometimes facing raucous crowds. Sensenbrenner has held more than 80 public town halls so far in 2017, according to the calendar on his website. Our rating Bryce said "Paul Ryan has not had a public town hall within the district for over 600 days." Bryce’s claim is broad and doesn’t account for the emerging ways people can communicate with public officials, but he’s mostly on target in saying Ryan hasn’t held a traditional town hall in almost two years. We rate his claim Mostly True. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com	None	Randy Bryce	None	None	None	2017-07-21T05:00:00	2017-07-09	['None']
pomt-01580	"Federal investigators found a company that (David Perdue) ran discriminated against women -- paid them less than men for the same work."	mostly true	/georgia/statements/2014/sep/09/emilys-list/emilys-list-attack-perdues-former/	EMILY’s List, a national group advocating for Democratic women candidates, has an attack ad out in Georgia’s closely watched U.S. Senate race between David Perdue, a Republican businessman, and Michelle Nunn, a Democrat and nonprofit executive. The ad focuses on a pay discrimination lawsuit filed by female managers at Dollar General while Perdue was CEO of the discount retailer. The lawsuit was settled several years later -- and after Perdue left the company -- for $18.75 million. The ad opens with a woman penning a letter to Perdue, explaining why he won’t be getting her vote. "Federal investigators found a company that you ran discriminated against women -- paid them less than men for the same work," the woman states. We decided that was a claim worth investigating. The ad, which is paid for by EMILY’s List’s WOMEN VOTE!, focuses on a 2006 lawsuit that was later expanded to cover thousands of female store managers at Dollar General. The lawsuit accused the chain of paying male managers more than females performing the same job, in violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Equal Pay Act of 1963. At the time, Dollar General had about 8,000 stores and about 70,000 employees. Perdue, who was Dollar General CEO from April 2003 to July 2007, was not named as a defendant in the lawsuit. Dollar General did not acknowledge any liability or wrongdoing. But the settlement agreement promised some policy changes, something legal experts say is fairly routine. The ad claim is based on part of the lawsuit record -- specifically, a letter from an area director for the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission in Jackson, Miss. to a complaining female manager. The February 2008 letter states that "available evidence establishes reasonable cause to believe" that female store managers in the district where the woman worked "were discriminated against" in violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, as amended, and the Equal Pay Act. The EEOC letter goes on to say that Dollar General’s explanation for the difference in pay "is not supported by the evidence nor is it sufficient to rebut the sex-based inference established by pay differentials." Sworn statements from several female Dollar General managers said the discounter had a pay system that perpetuated stereotypes for judging men and women on their pay, performance and salary needs. Derrick Dickey, spokesman for the Perdue campaign, told us that Dollar General, from the first legal filings to the final settlement, "always maintained that it was in full compliance with the Equal Pay Act." "Years after David left, the company made a prudent decision to allow its liability insurer to cover the mediated amount instead of continue the lengthy and expensive legal process," Dickey said. We asked Charlotte Alexander and Jaime Dodge, two employment law experts, to review documents filed in the lawsuit and weigh in on several issues, including the accuracy of the ad. ----------------------------- "Available evidence establishes reasonable cause to believe that (you) and other female managers in District #374 were discriminated against in violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, as amended and the Equal Pay Act as they generally were paid less than similarly situated managers performing duties requiring equal skill, effort and responsibility." -- excerpt from the EEOC statement -------------------------- Alexander, a Harvard Law School graduate and assistant professor of legal studies at Georgia State University, said the claim in the ad "on its face is true." "It seems to track the EEOC letter," she said. That letter "could have been damaging" at trial, but would not have meant an "automatic win" for the female managers, Alexander said. A judge and jury would not be bound to follow the EEOC’s findings, she said. "They would have to make their own determination from the ground up." Alexander said the lawsuit, filed against Dollar General parent company Dolgencorp, Inc., was "pretty significant, "with 2,000 female managers signing on as plaintiffs and more than 20,000 ultimately eligible to be part of the settlement agreement. Alexander said she does not believe $18.75 million would be a "nuisance settlement." (Those are settlements in cases, often without merit, that are reached just to avoid continuing and costly legal bills.) Dodge, a Harvard graduate, former member of the Harvard Law faculty and an assistant professor at UGA’s School of Law, strongly disagreed. She said there is "strong support" for the Perdue camp’s claim that Dollar General "simply settled to avoid litigation costs." The claims raised by the female managers at Dollar General are substantially similar, though not identical, to those raised in Wal-Mart v. Dukes, she said. Wal-Mart refused to settle, but it took nearly a decade of litigation all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court. The high court agreed with Wal-Mart that a nationwide class action for pay discrimination could not be fairly litigated, Dodge said. "Furthermore, and perhaps most importantly here, the court found that the idea of implicit bias against women in the retail workplace was not supported by any reliable scientific evidence presented in court," she said. As for the settlement amount, plaintiffs' lawyers were allowed to seek up to $6.25 million, and then the named plaintiffs each had the opportunity to receive $10,000 each (and $5,000 for others), Dodge said. The class of female managers may have received less than $1,000 per person on average, Dodge said. "That number says to me, either the pay gap was really small or the plaintiffs' had substantial doubts about the merits of their case, such that they settled for a very low percentage of the alleged damages. So, the settlement number does suggest that this was a weak case, in one way or another," she said. In summary: The ad is based on a letter from an EEOC area manager in MIssissippi, which says there was reasonable cause to believe female managers in at least one district were discriminated against in pay. The case never went to trial. The company settled out of court without admitting guilt. The statement is accurate on its face, but needs further clarification. We rate it as Mostly True.

pomt-12797	Says Bill Gates tweeted, "I think Donald Trump will go down to history as one of the greatest presidents, just like Reagan."	pants on fire!	/punditfact/statements/2017/feb/15/blog-posting/bill-gates-did-not-compare-donald-trump-ronald-rea/	A host of websites known for circulating dubious reports say that software magnate and philanthropist Bill Gates compared President Donald Trump to Ronald Reagan, but there’s no evidence that ever happened. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com In the last few weeks, multiple outlets shared a fake tweet allegedly from Gates making the claim, "After 17 minuts (sic) phone call with President Trump, I think he will go down as one of the greatest presidents just like Reagan." The tweet, shown above, is dated Jan. 22, 2017. Facebook flagged an example from Feb. 4, 2017, as part of its efforts to winnow fake news from its users’ news feeds. It’s difficult to say where the item originated, but it’s now widespread, having been reposted as recently as Valentine’s Day. Considering the dodgy grammar and spelling, the tweet itself likely came from a website allowing people to create fake tweets featuring real accounts. It’s not all that difficult to find one. It’s also easy to see that Gates didn’t send the tweet. While he has more than 33 million followers, Gates isn’t nearly as prolific a thumb-masher as Trump. The only tweet Gates appears to have sent on Jan. 22 was to congratulate former Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation CEO Jeff Raikes for being elected chairman of the Stanford University Board of Trustees. See Figure 2 on PolitiFact.com The Internet Archive doesn’t show that he tweeted anything else that day, so it doesn’t appear Gates mentioned Trump and then deleted it. He doesn’t appear to have ever tweeted about Trump at all, although he has been somewhat critical of Trump in the past. Gates did talk with Trump prior to his inauguration and did compare the real estate tycoon to a president — but it was John F. Kennedy, not Reagan. "A lot of his message has been about where he sees things not as good as he'd like," Gates said on CNBC on Dec. 13, 2016, about a phone call he had with Trump. "But in the same way President Kennedy talked about the space mission and got the country behind that, I think that whether it's education or stopping epidemics, other health breakthroughs, finishing polio, and in this energy space, there can be a very upbeat message that (Trump's) administration is going to organize things, get rid of regulatory barriers, and have American leadership through innovation, be one of the things that he gets behind." Gates met with the then-president-elect face-to-face in New York’s Trump Tower later that day for about an hour. "It was a good time," Gates said afterward. "We had a good conversation about innovation, how it can help in health, education, the impact of foreign aid and energy, and a wide-ranging conversation about power of innovation." But that tweet? Despite what scads of disreputable websites report, it never happened. We rate this claim Pants On Fire!

Then, in the silence, he started to slowly clap his hands once every few seconds, holding the audience in total silence. Then he said into the microphone, 'Children, every time I clap my hands together, a child in America dies from gun violence.' Then, little Darrell, with a proud South Carolina drawl, pierced the quiet and said, ‘Well, dumb a--, stop clappin’!’" The reader wanted to know: Did this really happen? We didn’t hear back from the White House, but we couldn’t find any instance of such an exchange in transcripts listed on the White House website or in the Nexis news database. A Google search turned up many variations of this claim repeated in the conservative blogosphere, but none from an independent news source. Snopes.com, the website that looks into urban legends, has also seen this chain email. Back in 2008, when Obama wasn’t even president yet, an email circulated that was essentially the same, but which involved a "little feller in East Texas" named Richard Earl. Even earlier, in September 2007, Snopes found one aimed at Hillary Clinton, who was then running against Obama in the Democratic presidential primary. This time, the episode supposedly took place in North Florida, with an unnamed "young voice with a proud southern accent" saying, "Well, just stop clappin’, ya evil b----!" It’s possible that this joke is very old indeed, but Snopes tracked the inspiration for it at least as far back as a 2005 video released by the group "Make Poverty History." The video, titled "Click," shows a variety of celebrities -- including Bono of U2, Brad Pitt and George Clooney -- snapping their fingers every three seconds. The narrator, Liam Neeson, explains that a child dies unnecessarily due to extreme poverty every three seconds. By the next year, 2006, Snopes documented an email similar to the Obama email, this one with Bono the target. In this version, it’s a voice with a "thick Scottish brogue" that tells Bono, "Well stop ----ing doing it then!!" This makes it clear that the episode is a joke rather than an actual event involving Obama. Our ruling A chain email said President Obama told a room of students, "Children, every time I clap my hands together, a child in America dies from gun violence." A child then purportedly told Obama he could solve the problem by not clapping anymore. We failed to find any evidence that this happened to Obama, and the existence of earlier emails making fun of Hillary Clinton and Bono make clear that this is a joke being passed off falsely as a real anecdote. We rate the claim Pants on Fire.	None	Chain email	None	None	None	2014-03-17T14:41:56	2014-03-17	['United_States', 'Barack_Obama']
pomt-15323	"Sen. Rubio’s (tax plan) would cut taxes for households making around $3 million a year by almost $240,000, which is way more than three times the earnings of a typical family."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/jul/16/hillary-clinton/would-rubios-tax-plan-mean-big-break-millionaires/	Hillary Clinton outlined her economic vision in detail for the first time during her presidential campaign, calling for a "growth and fairness" economy in a speech at the New School in Manhattan on July 13, 2015. She also lambasted a select group Republican presidential candidates for their purportedly out-of-touch approach toward the working class. Among the targets were Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker, former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush and U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida. Clinton singled out Rubio’s proposed tax plan: "Another priority must be reforming our tax code. Now, we hear Republican candidates talk a lot about tax reform. But take a good look at their plans. Sen. Rubio's would cut taxes for households making around $3 million a year by almost $240,000, which is way more than three times the earnings of a typical family." We decided to fact-check the somewhat intricate claim. Rubio’s plan Clinton’s campaign directed us to a blog post from the Tax Policy Center, an independent think tank that analyzes tax policy. The article concerns Rubio’s plan in general, but the pertinent part reads, "Those in the top 0.1 percent, who make $3.3 million and up, would be in line for an average tax cut of $240,000 — a boost in after-tax income of 3.8 percent." Is $240,000 more than "three times" the earning power of a typical family? Her campaign pointed us to U.S. Census Bureau data that showed median household income as $53,046 for the period 2009 to 2013. So those numbers back up Clinton’s statement. But there is one minor complication: The article from the Tax Policy Center is based on an analysis of Utah Sen. Mike Lee’s 2013 plan, not Rubio’s plan (actually a joint venture with Lee) that was released in 2015 and is similar to the original Lee plan. Generally speaking, the Rubio-Lee plan groups people into two income tax brackets, 15 percent or 35 percent, the higher of which would kick in at an individual income of $75,000. That’s a decrease from the seven brackets currently in place. Another centerpiece of the plan is a $2,500 tax credit given to parents for each child under sixteen. That’s the broad outline, but the plan still lacks some details. "There are critical unresolved issues that make it difficult for us to do an analysis of Rubio’s current plan," said Howard Gleckman, resident fellow at the Tax Policy Center and author of the blog post. For example, Gleckman points out that the Rubio-Lee plan never specifies exactly what would happen to a personal tax credit of $2,000, a subsidy that would be available to anybody who claimed it on their tax returns. If it were included as a refundable tax credit (meaning people could get a check back), it would have a significant impact on low-income families. As of now, their incomes would actually decrease under the Lee plan, according to the Tax Policy Center’s analysis. "Qualitatively, the rough sense is a very generous tax cut for high-income people," said Gleckman, adding, "What we’re not sure about is low-income people." So low-income people might get some kind of tax break under Rubio’s plan, or they might not. The other thing to know about Clinton’s statement is that the wealthy get a tax break under Rubio’s plan because he wants tax reductions, and the wealthy pay the most taxes. "The reason why the top is getting what’s seemingly a big tax cut is that they’re already taxed at a much higher rate," said Kyle Pomerleau, an economist at the Tax Foundation, a business-backed group. Under the Rubio plan, the top tax rate would drop from 39.6 percent to 35 percent. Pomerleau added that it’s crucial to remember that the plan proposes tax cuts across all income brackets, not just the top ones, and often at higher percentages for those with lower incomes. Pomerleau, however, did say that he found Clinton’s claim plausible. Our ruling Clinton said that Rubio’s tax plan "would cut taxes for households making around $3 million a year by almost $240,000, which is way more than three times the earnings of a typical family." It is possible to take issue with the statement in some ways. The source of her claim uses an earlier version of Rubio’s plan in its analysis, and she said $3 million when she should have said $3.3 million. But the thrust of her statement is sound. An analysis of a plan extremely similar to the one put forth by Rubio would cut taxes for those making $3.3 million and more by nearly $240,000, which is more than three times the U.S. median household income of $53,046.

pomt-15058	The tax policies of George W. Bush "created a dynamic effect of high growth."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/sep/27/jeb-bush/jeb-bush-says-tax-policies-george-w-bush-created-d/	During his 2016 Republican presidential bid, former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush has periodically had to answer for the record of his brother, George W. Bush, and he had to do it again on a recent edition of Fox News Sunday. Host Chris Wallace asked Bush, "Whether it was Ronald Reagan's tax cuts or your brother's tax cuts, they did add greatly to the deficit." Bush responded, "They didn't (add to the deficit) as greatly as the static thinkers on the left think. They created a dynamic effect of high growth. And that's what we need." We didn’t recall rapid economic growth under Bush, so we thought we’d look at the past five presidents’ records in order to gauge Jeb Bush’s comments. We’ll start by noting that boiling down a president’s policies over one or two terms is tricky. For instance, in Reagan’s case, he is generally thought of as an aggressive tax-cutter, and it’s certainly true that he cut taxes sharply early in his term. But he also raised taxes. We gave a Mostly True rating to a recent claim by TV host Stephen Colbert that Reagan "raised taxes when revenues did not match the expectations." For this reason, we’ll focus here on the most straightforward measure -- overall growth rates under each president. A look at the numbers We chose three measurements for comparing the five presidents. The most important statistic is the broadest one: the average annual increase in inflation-adjusted gross domestic product. Here’s a rundown of how the past five presidents have done on that score: Rank President Average annual GDP increase, inflation-adjusted 1 Clinton 3.9 2 Reagan 3.5 3 George H.W. Bush 2.3 4 George W. Bush 2.1 5 Obama 1.4 So by this measure, George W. Bush ranks second to last, undercutting Bush’s argument. What about the other yardsticks we checked? Bush did a bit better on these, though generally in the middle of the pack. Here’s how the presidents compare when measured by their single best year of inflation-adjusted GDP growth: Rank President Best year of inflation-adjusted GDP growth 1 Reagan 7.3 2 Clinton 4.7 3 George W. Bush 3.8 4 George H.W. Bush 3.7 5 Obama 2.5 And here’s how the five presidents compare on the number of years the economy exceeded 3 percent growth on their watch. Rank President Number of years of inflation-adjusted GDP growth of 3 percent or more 1 (tie) Clinton 6 1 (tie) Reagan 6 3 (tie) George W. Bush 2 3 (tie) George H.W. Bush 2 5 Obama 0 So Bush fares better on these other two measurements, but he still trails the two clear frontrunners in economic growth, Clinton and Reagan. Comparing Bush and Obama We should note that George W. Bush’s record on GDP growth does outpace Obama’s on each score, so to the extent that Jeb Bush was using Obama -- the president Bush hopes to succeed -- as a foil, he has a point. Still, it’s an exaggeration to tout George W. Bush’s economic record as one of "high growth" when compared to the records of Clinton and Reagan, and even to Bush’s father. As for Obama’s record, we’ll note that -- as low as it is on our rankings -- it’s still a work in progress. To calculate Obama’s record, we included the first two quarters of 2015. (Data for the third quarter is set to be released in October.) Given that Obama came into office in the midst of the Great Recession and that the recovery on his watch has been accelerating since 2010 -- albeit slowly -- Obama may ultimately overtake Bush when his final tally is available. Second-quarter growth for 2015 was 3.9 percent, which could suggest continued economic improvement in the months ahead. The Bush campaign’s response When we checked with Jeb Bush’s campaign, they made the point that because Wallace’s question referred to both Reagan and George W. Bush, Jeb Bush’s response was intended to refer to both presidents. But Reagan’s record on tax cuts was far more mixed than Bush’s; Reagan signed off on several significant tax increases. The Bush campaign also told PolitiFact that George W. Bush’s record is hampered by beginning with the economic impact of the 9/11 attacks and the bursting of the dot-com bubble. However, the same argument could be made -- and made even more strongly -- with the Great Recession inherited by Obama. Allocating credit and blame Finally, we will raise an issue that’s always relevant when comparing presidents on economic growth: It’s hard to determine credit or blame for economic performance on a president’s watch, because factors outside their control, from energy-price shocks to technological changes to pure luck, can have a significant impact. In addition, it’s unclear how much a president can influence the broader economy during their first year or two in office; for that early period, the legacy of their predecessor may have a greater impact. "The economics research is mixed as to how much federal tax policies can affect economic growth," said Tara Sinclair, a George Washington University economist and chief economist at the jobs site Indeed. Our ruling Jeb Bush said the tax policies of George W. Bush "created a dynamic effect of high growth." The definition of "high," of course, is relative, but if you look at the most directly comparable examples -- the past five presidents’ records in average, annual, inflation-adjusted growth in gross domestic product -- George W. Bush ranked fourth among the five presidents, and trailed the two strongest presidents in this regard, Clinton and Reagan, by a particularly wide margin. (Reagan’s policies included both tax cuts and tax increases.) Bush has so far maintained a lead over Obama, although Obama’s tenure is not finished yet. Still, it’s always worth noting that a president’s impact on the economy is not all-encompassing. Overall, though, the evidence doesn’t show that high growth occurred in the wake of the Bush tax cuts. We rate the claim Mostly False.

pomt-11354	After attacking Emma Gonzalez, U.S. Rep. Steve King is "facing arrest."	false	/punditfact/statements/2018/apr/05/political-thinkers/headline-falsely-says-rep-steve-king-facing-arrest/	A misleading headline on Facebook says that U.S. Rep. Steve King, R-Iowa, faces arrest after attacking Parkland survivor Emma Gonzalez for wearing a jacket with the Cuban flag. "Congressman just annihilated Parkland ‘victim’ in calling her out -- now he’s facing arrest!" said a March 29 headline on Political Thinkers, a conservative website. Facebook users flagged the post as being potentially fabricated, as part of the social network’s efforts to combat online hoaxes. We found no evidence that King faces arrest. The Political Thinkers story pertains to King’s campaign Facebook post criticizing Gonzalez for wearing a Cuban flag patch on her jacket while giving a speech during the March For Our Lives rally in Washington. "This is how you look when you claim Cuban heritage yet don’t speak Spanish and ignore the fact that your ancestors fled the island when the dictatorship turned Cuba into a prison camp, after removing all weapons from its citizens; hence their right to self defense," King's post said. According to Univision, Gonzalez’s father arrived in New York from Cuba in 1968. Some media reports and U.S. Rep. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, R-Miami, pushed back at King’s statements and noted that it’s common for Cuban-Americans in Miami to display the Cuban flag, which is not a sign of support for Castro. The Political Thinker website pointed to a memo by the Democratic Coalition Against Trump, which asked the House Office of Congressional Ethics to investigate King’s "unethical, xenophobic and racist Facebook post." The complaint by the anti-Trump organization drew scant media attention, and such ethics complaints often lead to no such action. Brett Kappel is a government affairs partner at the Akerman law firm who has represented members of Congress but not King. He said the Office of Congressional Ethics has dismissed roughly half of all complaints it has received since its inception. Of the 50 percent that were referred by the office to the House Ethics Committee, the vast majority were either dismissed by the Ethics Committee or the Ethics Committee took no action because the accused left the House due to resignation, retirement or to run for another office. "It would be extraordinarily rare for an OCE complaint to result in a criminal arrest, much less a conviction – but it is possible," he said, speaking in general about such cases, and not the one specifically about King. Kappel said that if the complaint is that King used campaign funds to hire family members, "that’s perfectly legal as long as the family members are paid the fair market value for the services they provide the campaign." The Office of Congressional Ethics doesn’t confirm tips it receives. However, any entity can file such requests, and the Office doesn’t need such submissions to launch an investigation. Bottom line: the fact that the group said in a memo that it asked the office to investigate King doesn’t mean that the office will investigate King. We reached out to King’s campaign and congressional office and did not get a reply for this fact-check. At a meeting hosted by a conservative club in Iowa days after his Facebook post, King said the post was intended to highlight the "irony" of a person of Cuban heritage advocating for gun control given that the communist government restricted possession of weapons. Our ruling A headline on Political Thinkers about King said that "Congressman just annihilated Parkland ‘victim’ in calling her out -- now he’s facing arrest!" While King’s comments about Gonzalez wearing a patch of the Cuban flag prompted a left-leaning group to file a complaint with the Office of Congressional Ethics, such complaints often lead to no action. It would be extraordinarily rare for any such complaint to the ethics office to lead to arrest, and there is no evidence that King faces arrest. We rate this claim False.

pomt-12654	The GOP’s Obamacare replacement would reduce subsidies that help lower-income people buy health insurance, but also "expand the entitlement" by giving subsidies to higher-income people "that Obamacare never helped."	true	/wisconsin/statements/2017/mar/23/ron-johnson/gop-obamacare-replacement-cuts-aid-lower-income-pe/	Two days before a showdown in the U.S. House of Representatives, with House Speaker Paul Ryan lobbying his colleagues hard to vote yes, a fellow Wisconsin Republican dumped on the GOP plan to replace Obamacare. "I’ve got a lot of problems with the House bill as it’s written right now," U.S. Sen. Ron Johnson said March 21, 2017 at a WisPolitics event in Washington, D.C. -- highlighting concerns over whether a top priority for Ryan and President Donald Trump can pass. Afterward, Johnson complained to a reporter about what he sees as a paradox: The replacement, he said, would reduce subsidies that help lower-income people buy health insurance, but also "expand the entitlement" by giving subsidies to higher-income people "that Obamacare never helped." Let’s see if Johnson’s right. Note: We’re fact checking Johnson’s claim based on the original GOP legislation, not on any changes that might have been made after his statement. The expected House vote on March 23, 2017 was postponed a few hours after this fact check was posted. Tax credits Johnson’s claim alludes to what are known as refundable tax credits that help people who buy their own health insurance. How they work: If a person has a federal tax bill of $2,500 and receives a $1,000 tax credit, the tax bill is reduced to $1,500. A refundable tax credit means that if the amount of the tax credit is greater than the amount of taxes owed, the taxpayer receives a refund for the difference. Both Obamacare and the GOP plan, referred to by Democrats as "Trumpcare," offer the credits. But, as Johnson indicated, they take different approaches. Obamacare: Tax credits are based on a person’s income and the cost of health insurance in the area where they live. The subsidies are available to people whose income is between 100 percent and 400 percent of the federal poverty level (in 2017, 400 percent is about $47,000 per year for an individual). The subsidies are larger for people with lower incomes and for those who live in areas where health care costs are higher. GOP plan: The credits vary by age -- people in their 20s would get $2,000 a year, with credits rising to $4,000 for people in their 60s. The eligibility extends to individuals who earn up to $75,000 a year -- a significantly higher income than under Obamacare. So, what’s the upshot? The effect on people An expert nonprofit organization in health care, the Kaiser Family Foundation, summarizes the differences this way: Under the GOP plan, lower-income people generally will get reduced tax credits compared to Obamacare -- especially those who are older and live in areas where health care costs more. Meanwhile, more people with higher incomes would become eligible for tax credits. Here are the average tax credits for a 40-year-old, according to Kaiser: Annual income in 2020 Obamacare tax credits GOP plan tax credits $20,000 $4,143 $3,000 $40,000* $1,021 $3,000 $75,000 0 $3,000 $100,000 0 $500 (In Milwaukee, the estimate is that the credit would be $1,280 with Obamacare and $3,000 with the GOP plan.) Our rating Johnson says the GOP’s Obamacare replacement would reduce subsidies that help lower-income people buy health insurance, but also "expand the entitlement" by giving subsidies to higher-income people "that Obamacare never helped." The Republican plan does offer subsidies, known as refundable tax credits, that are smaller for lower-income people than they are under Obamacare. And it does offer the credits to people with higher incomes than Obamacare does. We rate Johnson’s statement True.

pomt-05338	"Sources show (Connie) Mack as a resident of California, living with his wife in Palm Springs."	mostly false	/florida/statements/2012/may/14/george-lemieux/george-lemieux-says-connie-mack-california-residen/	U.S. Rep. Connie Mack represents Florida in Washington and is married to U.S. Rep. Mary Bono Mack of California. One of Connie Mack’s Republican rivals in the U.S. Senate race, George LeMieux, is suggesting that Mack doesn’t log much time in Florida. A Web ad released by the LeMieux campaign shows footage of a reporter asking Mack about the allegation that he doesn’t spend a lot of time in Florida: Mack: "You know, they’ll say that I’m never here. Well, the reality is I was in California last year maybe 11 days?" The narrator says, "Sources show Mack as a resident of California, living with his wife in Palm Springs. And they’ve been known to pop up on the red carpet. Then there is their place in Colorado. …. And court documents say Connie spent little time in the modest Florida condo. Even his ex-wife testified it was only purchased just to assist his political career. But Connie says his real home is in Florida. Do you believe him? …. Florida needs a full-time senator instead of a Half-Mack here half the time." The narrator calls for Mack to release his travel records to determine if he is really "California Connie, Colorado Connie or just modest Condo Connie." (There are two photos in the ad that viewers might assume are Mack at a ski resort or the inside of his Fort Myers condo. But a LeMieux campaign spokeswoman said they are stock art.) Mack’s campaign fought back saying that LeMieux was avoiding the issues. We can’t independently verify what percentage of Mack’s time is spent at his Florida condo. But we can put one LeMieux claim to the Truth-O-Meter: is Mack a resident of California living with his wife in Palm Springs? Residency rule It’s not uncommon for members of Congress to own or rent a residence in the Washington area. But the questions about Mack are a little different because he’s married to a member of Congress representing another state. Mack was first elected to Congress in 2004; he filed for divorce from his wife Ann in 2005. About two years later, Mack married U.S. Rep. Mary Bono, R-Calif., the widow of singer and Congressman Sonny Bono. After he announced his U.S. Senate bid in 2011, the Tampa Bay Times wrote that Mack had been "criticized for not spending enough time in Florida due to his wife. … Mack said he and his wife spend time together in Washington and then usually go separate ways on the weekend — the opposite situation from other lawmakers. Another incentive to be in Florida, he said: an 11-year-old daughter and an 8-year-old son from his first marriage are in the state." LeMieux’s online video doesn’t suggest that Mack is violating the law, but it tries to create the perception that he isn’t spending much time in Florida. The U.S. Constitution requires Senate candidates to be a citizen of the U.S. for at least nine years and a resident of the state when elected. Florida’s election code doesn’t define residency, according to a 1993 advisory opinion by the state Division of Elections. Florida courts "have consistently construed legal residence to mean a permanent residence, domicile, or permanent abode, rather than a residence that is temporary," states the opinion. (The state elections’ division told us the opinion is still valid even though it is nearly 20 years old.) Experts on election requirements told us that there is no "bright line" test to determine residency. "The idea is that you are supposed to be related in a meaningful way to the state you represent, and you don’t just show up to run for office," said Frances Hill, who teaches election law at the University of Miami. Mack addresses residency question During a stop in Tallahassee on May 4, 2012, PolitiFact Florida asked Mack about his living situation. "The question they (opponents) try to get to is, am I spending all of my time in California? And it's just not true. As many times as I've answered that ... last year I think I spent maybe 11 days in California," he said. "What I'm saying is this, it's political fodder that my opponents like to spin. But to give you an example ... Monday I was in Miami. Tuesday morning in Miami, Tuesday afternoon in Fort Myers, Tuesday evening here in Tallahassee, then we went to Panama City, Pensacola, back here in Tallahassee, then we're going to go to Jacksonville, then we're going to Fort Lauderdale, then we go to Fort Myers, then we go to Orlando, then I go back to DC for votes." The example he gave is expected of a campaign, PolitiFact Florida noted. We asked him to elaborate on how he divides his time on a day-to-day basis. "I just gave you every day. This is my home, this is where I live, and this is a cheap political shot by my opponents that other than the press and my opponent, no one asks. It's not on their mind. They're not concerned about it. They know that this is where I am." Homes owned by Mack or his wife Here’s what we found when we looked for homes owned by Mack (whose legal name is Cornelius McGillicuddy IV) or his current wife Mary Bono Mack: Fort Myers: Mack owns a 3-bedroom, 2-bathroom condo at 15081 Tamarind Cay Court in Fort Myers, Lee County property records show. Mack and his first wife, Ann, bought the condo for $166,900 in October 2003. After her husband filed for divorce in 2005, Ann stated in a September 2005 divorce court filing that Mack bought it to "solely to assist his political career" when he was running in the congressional district for the area. The Mack campaign disputes Ann’s account. After he won the election in 2004, the family moved to a 5-bedroom home in Alexandria, Va. Ann wrote that they spent very little time in the "modest" condo in Fort Myers. She argued during the divorce proceedings that he forced her and their two children to live in the "small political stake in the sand" in Fort Myers while he stayed in the home in Virginia. Mack later sold the Virginia home. Mack has a homestead exemption on his Fort Myers condo. The Tampa Tribune raised questions about Mack’s exemption because his current wife has an exemption on her California home. Under Florida state law, Mack is entitled to the exemption if he can prove his finances aren’t co-mingled with those of his wife. Mack campaign spokesman David James told the Miami Herald in February that Mack meets that criteria: "They file separate returns, do not have joint accounts, and Connie’s name is not on Mary’s home in California, and Mary’s is not on Connie’s home in Fort Myers," James said. (James also sent us similar statements from Mack’s attorney,Craig Engle.) Lee County Property Appraiser Ken Wilkinson said in February that he would research the legality of Mack’s homestead but told the Miami Herald/Tampa Bay Times: "I think they’ll be okay. That’s my gut feeling," Wilkinson said. "But I now have an obligation to check this out." Mack has until around mid September to submit evidence showing that their finances are separate. The homestead controversy surfaced after Mack criticized Democratic Sen. Bill Nelson for getting an agricultural exemption on a Brevard County property. Palm Springs, Calif.: Mary Bono purchased an $875,000 three-bedroom home at 64505 Via Amante in Palm Springs in 1998. The home is 5,450 square feet and worth about $1.1 million, Riverside County records show. Durango, Colo.: Mack’s 2011 financial disclosure states that he has a mortgage on a rental property in Durango, Colo., between $250,001 and $500,000 from October 2010. He also wrote that he was 16.67 percent owner in the property, which is owned by the company Mack and his wife formed, Westerfield Scotch LLC. La Plata, County records show that the two-bedroom two-bath unit is nearly 2,000-square feet and that they purchased the condo for $692,500 in October 2010. A warranty deed from October states that Mack and Bono Mack "whose legal address is 64505 Via Amante, Palm Springs...." A November 2010 warranty deed signed by Mack and Bono Mack states that "Connie Mack and Mary Bono Mack of the county of Riverside, state of California, and Westerfield Scotch, a Colorado limited liability company, whose legal address is 64505 Via Amante, Palm Springs..." The couple occasionally stays there for vacations and rent it out to others, Bono Mack’s spokesman Ken Johnson said. Her adult children are also owners. Mack’s attorney Craig Engle told PolitiFact the "document is mistaken" when it states that Mack’s legal address is in Palm Springs and that it would be wrong to interpret that document to mean that Mack is a California resident. Engle stated that the documents had to list an address for mailing purposes, and that could be why it has Bono Mack’s Palm Springs address. Arlington, Va.: Mary Bono purchased a two-bedroom condo at 3600 S. Glebe Road at the Eclipse at Center Park in Arlington, Va., for $549,313 in March 2007. She married Mack later that year. Connie Mack’s name doesn’t appear on that record, and a court land records clerk told us only Bono’s name is on the deed. The congresswoman had the condo under construction contract starting in 2005, her spokesman said. (The Web ad doesn’t mention this condo.) Conclusion LeMieux’s web ad states "Sources show Mack as a resident of California, living with his wife in Palm Springs." It’s legitimate to raise the question of how much time Mack spends in various places. And we can’t independently verify how much time he spends in California compared to his Fort Myers condo or anywhere else. But in this case, the ad’s "sources" are deeds for a Colorado condo owned by Mack and his wife that list their legal address as the Palm Springs home. While it’s unusual to have a spouse who lives in another state, both Mack and his wife work in Washington. They also owned their own homes and had professional careers in their respective states before they married. Given that context, we don’t think the deed to a vacation home in Colorado is definitive proof that Mack is living in California.

pomt-15233	Says that Donald Trump "supported Charlie Crist."	mostly true	/florida/statements/2015/aug/07/marco-rubio/marco-rubio-says-donald-trump-supported-charlie-cr/	During the GOP debate, Donald Trump was grilled about his past political donations, including to Democrats such as Hillary Clinton and Nancy Pelosi. "You explained away those donations saying you did that to get business-related favors. And you said recently, when you give, they do whatever the hell you want them to do," said Bret Baier, one of the Fox News moderators. "You’d better believe it," Trump said. He added, "Most of the people on this stage, I’ve given to -- just so you understand -- a lot of money." Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., then chimed in: "Not me! Not me!" After some crosstalk, Rubio added, "Actually to be clear, he supported Charlie Crist." Those are fighting words when you accuse a Republican -- one running for president, no less -- of supporting former Florida Gov. Charlie Crist, a party flip-flopper. We went back to check to see if Trump supported Crist. 2010 Senate race First, a refresher on that Rubio vs. Crist battle. In 2009, former House Speaker Rubio launched what began as an uphill battle against Crist -- then the Republican governor -- for a U.S. Senate seat. Crist’s relationship with his party soured over time, and in April 2010, Crist ditched the GOP and became an independent. Rubio ended up winning the race, beating both Crist and Democrat Kendrick Meek. A couple years later, Crist became a Democrat and lost his race against Republican Gov. Rick Scott in 2014. (Now he is weighing a run for Congress in 2016 in Pinellas County.) Trump did donate to Crist in the 2010 Senate race and hosted fundraisers for him. The caveat is that Crist was still a Republican at the time. A Rubio spokesman sent us Federal Election Commission reports showing two donations Trump made to Crist’s campaign in 2009: $2,400 on Oct. 16 and $2,400 on Nov. 17. Trump hosted a fundraiser for Crist at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Palm Beach on Dec. 11, 2009, and a fundraiser in July 2009 in Long Island. Both events called for at least $1,000 donations. The Broward/Palm Beach New Times wrote that the Long Island fundraiser was a party hosted by Trump as well as Jill Zarin, one of the stars of Bravo TV’s The Real Housewives of New York City and a friend of Crist’s wife, Carole Rome. "Let's hope Crist doesn't choke on his sirloin if Trump brings up any of his condo projects in South Florida," New Times wrote. "Buyers in the Trump International Hotel & Tower in Fort Lauderdale would surely be pleased to know that their governor and would-be senator is getting so much dough from the millionaire many of them are now suing." Trump also supported Crist prior to 2010. The Tampa Bay Times wrote in 2005 that Trump was slated to host a fundraiser at Trump Towers in Manhattan for Crist’s 2006 run for governor. The Times reported that Crist was introduced to Trump at a charity benefit in 1998 and then met with him in New York in May 2005 to discuss his candidacy. "He could not have been more gracious or more hospitable," Crist said at the time. "The guy cares about Florida. He has a residence in Florida and spends a lot of time in Florida." We emailed spokespersons for Trump on debate night and did not get a reply. Our ruling Rubio said Trump "supported Charlie Crist" rather than Rubio. During the 2010 Senate race in Florida, Trump gave Crist $4,800. Trump also hosted two fundraisers for Crist that year, and Crist met with Trump to huddle about a prospective campaign as early as 2005. The only caveat, in the context of an exchange about Trump’s imperfect party loyalty, is that Crist was a Republican at the time. We rate this claim Mostly True.

pomt-14903	On support for the Export-Import Bank	full flop	/wisconsin/statements/2015/nov/06/glenn-grothman/rep-glenn-grothman-hears-employers-changes-stance-/	As a state senator running for Congress in 2014, Glenn Grothman of Campbellsport had some strong opinions about the Export-Import Bank. Like the other conservative Republicans contending for the open seat, Grothman was against the obscure federal agency. "We do not need corporate welfare, which I guess I would say the Import-Export Bank is," Grothman said at a July 29, 2014 candidate forum. Grothman ultimately won the seat, but now sees things another way. Time to break out the Flip-O-Meter, which examines whether a politician has changed position on an issue. Remember: It does not measure whether any change is good or bad policy or politics, only whether the candidate has been consistent. The Export-Import Bank helps U.S. companies sell their goods and services in foreign countries by providing financing for export deals. Opponents echo Grothman’s "corporate welfare" line, while supporters say the bank helps level the playing field for U.S. companies competing in the global marketplace. Things looked bad for the bank’s future during the summer of 2015 after conservatives in the House of Representatives refused to reauthorize funding. The House let the charter of the bank lapse at the end of June. The Senate voted to reauthorize the bank on July 26, 2015 and in the fall efforts to revive the measure in the House gained steam as prominent business groups pressed for reauthorization. In Wisconsin, that came as General Electric Co. announced Sept. 28, 2015 it would cut hundreds of jobs in Waukesha and move the work to Canada. The company said the move was being made because of the demise of the bank. In an interview, Grothman said that as a reauthorization vote drew closer, he heard from 42 businesses in his district with officials urging him to vote to continue the bank, which he did when the matter came before the House on Oct. 27, 2015. "You add that up and you add up the fact that such a high number of manufacturing jobs are tied to suppliers," Grothman said of the calls he received. "Per capita, Wisconsin is one of the largest users of the Export-Import Bank." Grothman cited The Manitowoc Co., Caterpillar Corp. and Oshkosh Corp.’s Pierce fire engine division as among the heavy users of the bank. The congressman also said he learned more about the economy of Wisconsin’s 6th congressional district, which he represents. "This district has more manufacturing jobs than almost any other one," he said, adding: "It’s not something I dealt with in the state Legislature." As for the position he took at the debate, Grothman said he was "called upon to give an answer about the bank. Obviously, I got one side of the issue when I said I was opposed to it. You talk to the big manufacturers and you get the other side of it." Grothman is not the first state politician to switch positions on funding the bank. U.S. Sen. Ron Johnson (R-Wis.) voted against the bank shortly after he took office in 2012. He joined the majority in supporting the agency in July 2015. In an interview with the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, Johnson said he changed his mind after hearing from state employers. We rated his switch a Full Flop. Our rating As a candidate in 2014, Grothman said he was opposed to the Export-Import Bank, calling it a form of corporate welfare. A little more than a year later, after hearing from key manufacturers in his district, the congressman changed his mind and voted for the bank’s reauthorization. That’s a Full Flop.

pomt-08592	Says more than 2 million Oregonians have received important medical services because of his health plan.	half-true	/oregon/statements/2010/sep/24/john-kitzhaber/john-kitzhaber-says-2-million-people-got-health-ca/	The Oregon Health Plan is John Kitzhaber’s baby. Oregon launched his groundbreaking health plan in 1994 when the state got special waivers from the federal government to change the way it handles Medicaid, the health insurance for the nation’s poorest people. Under Oregon’s plan, the state limits the services Medicaid pays for, with an emphasis on providing preventive and ongoing medical care. By limiting what services are offered, Oregon was able to expand the number of people who were covered. Kitzhaber came up with the idea and championed it during his years as a state senator and governor. When the plan launched in 1994, about 350,000 Oregonians were eligible. According to an official history of the plan published by the state, 250,000 already had Medicaid coverage. The expansion added 100,000 Oregonians who, until then, didn’t have health insurance. Today the health plan covers 523,000 Oregonians. About 20 percent of them wouldn’t be getting health insurance if not for the plan’s expanded Medicaid provisions. But the plan has struggled because of budget constraints and over the years cut back the number of people who are covered. Kitzhaber, a Democrat now seeking a third term as governor, talks proudly of his plan. On Aug. 15, 2010, in an interview on KQEN AM in Roseburg, he assessed the plan this way: "The health plan I think in many respects has been a big success. Over 2 million Oregonians have received important medical services because of it." We wondered about the "2 million" figure in a state that today has a population of 3.8 million. Campaign spokeswoman Jillian Schoene says the number comes from the Oregon Department of Human Services, which oversees the health plan. So we checked with the folks at the Oregon Health Plan. Sean Kolmer, the deputy administrator for the health plan’s office of policy and research, says the 2 million includes people who have been enrolled in the health plan at any time since 1994. He points out many people have come into the plan and left it over the years. He says the tally doesn’t double count. "Those are unique individuals," he says. But the second part of Kitzhaber’s statement doesn’t hold up. Note that Kitzhaber told his radio listeners the 2 million health plan participants got coverage "because of it." With this cause-and-effect claim, Kitzhaber is saying the 2 million wouldn’t have received "important medical services" if his health plan hadn’t existed. And that’s not true. The majority of people in the plan would have had coverage under Medicaid anyway, and still would if the plan vanished tomorrow. How many of the 2 million would have received health coverage if the plan hadn’t existed? We asked the folks at the health plan and, at our request, they did a count. The answer: Kolmer says that 59 percent of those folks would have received Medicaid coverage anyway. That means 41 percent got coverage because of Kitzhaber’s health plan. Kitzhaber is indeed the creator of the Oregon Health Plan and -- as the records shows -- he can legitimately claim credit for expanding health coverage to about 820,000 people. Taking credit for the entire 2 million is a stretch. We find his claim Half True. Comment on this item.	None	John Kitzhaber	None	None	None	2010-09-24T11:41:24	2010-08-15	['Oregon_Territory']
pomt-08997	Under President George W. Bush, the U.S. had "52 months of ... uninterrupted job creation" and "revenues were at an all-time high in 2007."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/jul/13/ed-gillespie/gillespie-touts-bush-record-taxes-job-creation/	On the July 11, 2010, edition of NBC's Meet the Press, Republican strategist Ed Gillespie sought to contrast favorably economic performance under President George W. Bush to that under President Barack Obama. Gillespie -- a former top aide to Bush -- said "the fact is, under the Bush tax cuts, we did have 52 months of ... uninterrupted job creation, longest in the history of the country, and revenues were at an all-time high in 2007. The problem wasn't lack of revenue. The problem still remains today too much federal spending, and this administration's not addressing that." We thought it would be worth checking two of Gillespie's claims. • Did Bush preside over 52 months of uninterrupted job creation? Close, but not quite. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the economy added more jobs than it lost during 50 out of 52 months between September 2003 and December 2007. The economy lost jobs over two months during that stretch -- between June 2007 and July 2007 (20,000 jobs) and between July 2007 and August 2007 (71,000). That falls slightly short of being "uninterrupted." Gillespie would have been correct if he'd said that jobs grew for 46 consecutive months. We might add that over the course of Bush's presidency -- a total of 96 months -- the economy created 1.08 million jobs. That may sound like a lot, but compared to every other post-World War II president prior to Obama, it's the lowest average annual percentage increase in jobs created. (See our calculations here.) That said, Obama's figures are worse than any of his postwar predecessors'. The economy has shed between 2.4 million and 3.1 million jobs during the 18 months he's been in office, depending on whether you start counting with the January 2009 figures or the February 2009 figures. • Were revenues at an all-time high in 2007? Strictly speaking, yes. According to the Urban Institute-Brookings Institution Tax Policy Center, total federal tax receipts hit $2.57 trillion in 2007, before declining in 2008 and 2009, when the current recession was under way. (Tax revenues almost always sink during a recession.) The 2007 level was the highest recorded since 1934, when statistics were first collected. So on that score, Gillespie's right. But using this particular statistic neglects a key factor -- the size of the economy as a whole. Though recessions and expansions produce volatility in tax collections, as do changes in tax policy, one would expect that a bigger economy would generally produce greater tax revenues than a smaller one. And indeed, in the 57 tax years between 1951 and 2007, tax collections grew 49 times on a year-to-year basis -- a consistent trend despite frequent changes in tax rates and periodic recessions. You can easily factor out the size of the U.S. economy if you divide revenue by gross domestic product, or GDP. The Tax Policy Center has also calculated these numbers. In 2007, tax revenues represented 18.5 percent of GDP. That's high by historical standards but hardly a record. It only ties for 16th place going back to 1934, and within the 14-year stretch between 1996 and 2009 it only rises to 7th place. So if Gillespie's point is that Bush's tax cuts led to record revenues, they did -- for 2007 at least -- but that was a record aided by a the largest, non-recession economy in American history. Ultimately, Gillespie two comments are generally accurate, but they would have benefited from some additional historical context. We realize that this is not always possible during a fast-paced television show, so on balance, we rate his statement Mostly True.

pomt-10463	Denies that he said the Obama campaign "played the race card."	pants on fire!	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/apr/22/bill-clinton/yes-he-did/	Making a hard-charging statement and then denying you ever said it is a tricky proposition in the best of circumstances. It's particularly difficult when the initial statement and the denial are caught on tape and posted to the Internet. Which brings us to the case of former President Bill Clinton on the campaign trail in Pennsylvania. On April 21, 2008, Clinton gave a provocative interview to National Public Radio affiliate WHYY in which he said the Obama campaign "played the race card on me." He later denied saying that. Given the seriousness of the original charge — the ex-president claiming his wife's rival for the Democratic nomination tried to exploit racial issues to damage him — we decided to examine Clinton's denial of that charge. Did he say it or didn't he? He did. Here's how it happened: WHYY interviewer Susan Phillips asked him about the South Carolina primary, when he compared Barack Obama's January win there to Jesse Jackson's win in 1988. Phillips said at least one black leader had been offended by that comparison, saying it marginalized Obama, and switched support from Hillary Clinton to Obama. Phillips asked, "Do you think that (comment) was a mistake, and would you do that again?" Clinton gave a lengthy response, which you can hear via YouTube here . For our fact-checking purposes, the relevant passages are below: "No. I think that they played the race card on me. ... I said, if you go back to what I said. ... First of all, there was a conversation that I engaged in that included two African-American members of Congress, who were standing right there, who were having the conversation with me. And I said that Jesse Jackson had won a good campaign with overwhelming African-American support and white supporters. And this was started off because people didn't wanna — they wanted to act like, for reasons I didn't understand, that Senator Obama didn't have this African-American support, or they thought his white support was better because Jesse Jackson had blue-collar working people, and most of Senator Obama's support were upscale, cultural liberals. So it was like beneath them to be compared to Jesse Jackson. "I respect Jesse Jackson. He's a friend of mine, even though he endorsed Senator Obama. One of his sons and his wife endorsed Hillary. Their whole family's divided. But his campaign in 1988 was a seminal campaign in American history. It was the first campaign ever to openly involve gays. Hillary's chief delegate counter, Harold Ickes, worked his heart out for Jesse Jackson. I frankly thought the way the Obama campaign reacted was disrespectful to Jesse Jackson. And I called him and asked him if he found anything offensive, and he just laughed and he said, 'Of course I don't. We all know what's going on.' ... "And this was used out of context and twisted for political purposes by the Obama campaign to try to breed resentment elsewhere. And, you know, do I regret saying it? No. Do I regret that it was used that way? I certainly do. But you really gotta go some to try to portray me as a racist." So, here's where Clinton gets in trouble. The next day, NBC News' Mike Memoli asked Clinton about some of the things he had said in that radio interview. NBC: "Sir, what did you mean yesterday when you said that the Obama campaign was playing the race card on you?" Clinton: "When did I say that, and to whom did I say that?" NBC: "On WHYY radio yesterday." Clinton: "No, no, no. That's not what I said. You always follow me around and play these little games, and I'm not going to play your games today. This is a day about election day. Go back and see what the question was, and what my answer was. You have mischaracterized it to get another cheap story to divert the American people from the real urgent issues before us, and I choose not to play your game today. Have a nice day." NBC: "Respectfully sir, though, you did say ..." Clinton: "Have a nice day. I said what I said, you can go and look at the interview. And if you'll be real honest, you'll also report what the question was and what the answer was." You can read more of the exchange and watch the video here . It's hard to know what more to say on this one. Clinton was asked to explain an intriguing accusation he made against the Obama campaign and responded by saying he didn't say it. But he did. Even when we review the full context of the original radio interview, as Clinton suggests, the facts here don't budge. We say ... Pants on Fire!

pomt-12106	Says "Barcelona terrorist" is cousins with former President Barack Obama.	pants on fire!	/punditfact/statements/2017/aug/23/blog-posting/barcelona-terrorist-related-barack-obama-fake-news/	A fake news story falsely claimed that one of the suspected terrorists arrested after an attack in Barcelona is actually former President Barack Obama’s cousin. "Barcelona terrorist has a cousin in the U.S. named Barack," read the headline on an Aug. 19, 2017, post on NewsConservative.com. Facebook users flagged the post as being potentially fabricated, as part of the social network’s efforts to cut down on fake news. The story said Driss Oukabir, a 28-year-old Moroccan-born man arrested after terrorists killed 13 and injured more than 100 in Barcelona on Aug. 17, had toured the White House in 2009. The trip was sponsored by his first cousin, whom the story named as Obama. "Oukibir (sic) is the 7th child of the 5th wife of the brother of Barack Obama Sr., Obama’s father from Kenya," the story read. "Being first cousins, he was able to gain an audience and actually sit in the Oval Office. Eight years later he drove a vehicle into a crowd, killing at least a dozen people." In reality, Driss Oukabir is the brother of 18-year-old Moussa Oukabir, who is suspected of being the driver of a van that purposely ran into people in Barcelona. As many as three vans, including the one used in the terror attack, were allegedly rented with Driss Oukabir’s ID. Driss Oukabir turned himself into authorities after media outlets began circulating his photo in connection with the attack. He told police in the Spanish city of Ripoll, where he lived, that his identification had been stolen and that he did not participate in any terrorist activities. That's where the truth ends. The story of any relation to Obama, however, is pure bunk, and comes from an infamous fake news site. The post first appeared Aug. 17 on TheLastLineOfDefense.org, a parody site that attempts to fool conservatives with absurd stories. It’s run by a self-described liberal troll named Christopher Blair. The fake story included a photograph of Driss Oukabir, with an inset photo of a winking Obama. "Obama can’t be convicted for being a man’s cousin but he can be investigated for aiding and abetting terrorists," the story read. A note on the bottom of TheLastLineOfDefense.org noted that "everything on this site is a satirical work of fiction." Its About Us section carried a disclaimer that read, "We present fiction as fact and our sources don’t actually exist." The tale of a suspected terrorist being a cousin to Obama is entirely made up.

pomt-15114	When it comes to classified information at the State Department, Hillary Clinton’s "the decider."	half-true	/punditfact/statements/2015/sep/11/juan-williams/williams-clinton-was-decider-classified-info-state/	The ultimate impact of Hillary Clinton’s email woes is anyone’s guess, but a disclosure this week did the Democratic presidential candidate no favors. The New York Times reported that a second intelligence agency review found Top Secret material in emails Clinton received on her personal account. The majority view on Fox News’ The Five was that this proved that Clinton played fast and loose with very classified information and broke the Obama administration’s rules. The lone dissenting voice was Juan Williams, who argued that Clinton had the right to exercise her own judgment about how sensitive the material was. "When it comes to 'classified' at the State Department, she’s the decider," Williams said. This drew a chorus of you are so wrongs from the rest of the panel. We thought we’d try to sort out whether the secretary of state is the "decider," as Williams put it. Williams’ assertion is not as out-of-bounds as his fellow panelists on The Five let on. Clinton, as the head of the State Department, has the authority to classify information. The power is spelled out in President Barack Obama’s executive order on national security information. It reads: The authority to classify information originally may be exercised only by: (1) the President and the Vice President; (2) agency heads and officials designated by the President; and (3) United States Government officials delegated this authority pursuant to paragraph (c) of this section. The executive order goes on to say that an agency head, such as Clinton, can designate a deputy to oversee the classification process. The State Department’s Foreign Affairs Manual spells things out a little further, saying that "those occupying various positions in the Department and at posts abroad have the authority to classify information originally as Top Secret. The positions include the Secretary, the Deputy Secretaries, the Under Secretaries, Assistant Secretaries, and some Executive Level IV officials and their deputies; Chiefs of Mission, Charges d’affaires, and U.S. Representatives to various international organizations." Long story short, Clinton formally had a role in the classification process. But practically, the responsibility to classify information was not, or ever, solely Clinton’s. Daniel Metcalfe is professor of law at American University and former director of the Department of Justice’s Office of Information Policy. "As a practical matter, 99 percent of the time, things that came to her would have been reviewed for classification and acted on by someone lower down," Metcalfe said. "That doesn’t preclude her from saying ‘Oh my goodness, this should be classified,’ because she is the ultimate authority within the State Department. But it wasn’t her role." Nate Jones, an archivist at the National Security Archives based at George Washington University, drew attention to an additional complexity. Clinton might be the final word at the State Department, but only for material that her agency first produced. If another agency, such as the CIA, was the original author, then it had the right to slap a security label on it that the State Department would need to respect. "While I believe the other agencies' claims may very likely be dubious -- like claiming that the fact that the United States kills people in Pakistan with drones is classified -- they are allowed to bureaucratically make them despite Clinton being the agency head," Jones told PunditFact. According to the New York Times article, some of the emails in question contained Top Secret material that originated from intelligence agencies. Clinton has said that emails on her private server contained no information that was marked classified. Williams did not respond to a request for comment. Our ruling Williams said that at the State Department, Clinton was "the decider" over what was and wasn’t classified material. Formally speaking, there is some truth to the claim. But practically, it’s a stretch. The responsibility is shared among many people, and while Clinton could play a role, it wouldn’t typically be her primary or even secondary concern. Additionally, the secretary of state isn’t the arbiter of information that originated from another agency. Williams’ claim is partially accurate. We rate it Half True.

pomt-08358	Ed Perlmutter voted for "Viagra for rapists" paid for with tax dollars.	pants on fire!	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/oct/26/american-action-network/viagra-sex-offenders-paid-health-care-bill-nope/	A new campaign ad makes the startling claim that the new health care law will pay for Viagra for rapists -- and that Rep. Ed Perlmutter, D-Colo., voted for the measure. The ad shows two young women chatting online about the new health care bill. Here's how their conversation goes: "Hey, you have to check out the article I just sent you. Apparently convicted rapists can get Viagra paid for by the new health care bill." "Are you serious?" "Yes. I mean, Viagra for rapists? With my tax dollars? And Congressman Perlmutter voted for it." "Perlmutter voted for it?" "Yup. I mean, what is going on in Washington?" "In November, we need to tell Perlmutter to repeal it." The ad is from American Action Network, a conservative advocacy group organized as a 501(c)4, which means it does not have to disclose its donors. Its chief executive officer is Norm Coleman, a former Republican Senator from Minnesota. Its president is Rob Collins, a former chief of staff to House Minority Whip Eric Cantor. Perlmutter did vote in favor of final passage of the health care law. But did Perlmutter vote for Viagra for rapists? The short answer is no. Here's the long version: The health care law affects nearly every part of the health care system. It increases regulations for health insurance companies, reins in future costs in the Medicare program for seniors, expands the Medicaid program for the poor and creates new tax breaks so that individuals and small businesses can purchase insurance with partial government subsidies. It's this last measure that health care opponents have connected back to Viagra for sex offenders. Starting in 2014, some people will get tax credits to help them buy insurance policies. The credits are available to anyone who qualifies by having an income of between 133 to 400 percent of the federal poverty level. For a family of four in 2010, that ranges from $29,327 to $88,200, and for a single person, it's $14,403 to $43,320. They'll have to buy their policies through government-sponsored exchanges, which will set rules so that insurers offer standardized policies. During the final negotiations for the health care law in the Senate, Sen. Tom Coburn, R-Okla., pointed out that because anyone can qualify for the tax breaks, it's possible that sex offenders will buy insurance policies with government subsidies. And they might ask for and be prescribed Viagra. That means tax dollars will be subsidizing Viagra for sex offenders, Coburn concluded. It's actually an issue that's come up before, though in a different context. In 2005, the federal government had to direct states to make sure that sex offenders were not being prescribed Viagra while on Medicaid, the government-run health insurance program for the poor. (Press reports indicated it was happening.) During the 2010 debate, Coburn asked the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service about whether the health care law had any specific clause to prevent similar problems. The service issued a memo concluding that it did not. So Coburn offered an amendment that would "reduce the cost of providing federally funded prescription drugs by eliminating fraudulent payments and prohibiting coverage of Viagra for child molesters and rapists and for drugs intended to induce abortion." But by the time the Senate took up the amendment on March 24, 2010, it was late in the process. The bill's sponsors said any changes, no matter how small, could effectively kill the bill, so they opposed Coburn's amendment for procedural reasons. Sen. Max Baucus, D-Mont., urged his colleagues to reject the amendment, saying, "This is a serious bill. This is a serious debate. The amendment offered by the senator from Oklahoma makes a mockery of the Senate, the debate and the American people... It is a crass political stunt aimed at making 30-second commercials, not public policy." The amendment failed, 57-42, and the president signed the law six days later. Now, nearly seven months later, the commercial has turned up. We want to emphasize that the Viagra amendment came up in the Senate. Perlmutter is a member of the U.S. House of Representatives. He never got the chance to vote one way or the other on the amendment. The Perlmutter campaign was not amused by the ad's claims, calling them "blatant lies." "It's so illogical it would be like saying the bill allows Martians masquerading as humans to see a proctologist," said spokeswoman Leslie Oliver in a statement. American Action Campaign e-mailed a factsheet that says by virtue of voting for final passage for the health care bill that did not include the anti-Viagra amendment, he was voting for Viagra. The ad itself flashes an editorial from the Washington Times, headlined "Obamacare's Viagra giveaway." The editorial said the Senate should have voted for the Viagra amendment and questioned whether Democrats were sincere in their procedural objections. We should note that the use of taxpayer dollars for sex-offender Viagra remains a hypothetical. While CRS concluded that there was nothing in the current law to stop it from happening, the earliest it could start is in 2014 -- so there's time for lawmakers to act or for the Secretary of Health and Human Services to write regulations to stop it from happening. Finally, whatever taxpayer subsidies for sex offenders might materialize after 2014, they would not go to all sex offenders -- only to sex offenders who get health care through the exchanges and who also qualify for subsidies. We've looked at similar claims made against U.S. senators and rated the claims Barely True. But this claim is different. The House never voted on the sex offenders amendment. Perlmutter never voted on it either. So we rate the statement the statement Pants on Fire.	None	American Action Network	None	None	None	2010-10-26T19:02:03	2010-10-21	['None']
pomt-01680	Sen. Jeff Merkley "voted six times for more debt."	false	/oregon/statements/2014/aug/15/freedom-partners/did-sen-jeff-merkley-vote-six-times-more-debt/	Oregon Democratic Sen. Jeff Merkley and his Republican challenger, newcomer Monica Wehby, are trading barbs as they head toward their November showdown. Wehby is now the beneficiary of a new television advertising campaign mounted by a group called Freedom Partners Chamber of Commerce -- a political arm of conservative billionaire industrialists Charles and David Koch. The claim: A new 30-second advertising spot just launched this month as part of an estimated $3.6 million effort on Wehby’s behalf takes Merkley to task on spending issues. Merkley, according to the narrator "voted six times to raise the debt limit." While the narrator is speaking, though, red letters appear next to a screen shot of Oregon’s junior senator, proclaiming: "VOTED 6 TIMES FOR MORE DEBT." Did Merkley, as the screen words assert, vote half a dozen times "for more debt?" PolitiFact Oregon checked. The analysis: Wehby has said she welcomes the ad campaign but made it clear she didn’t work with the group. Doing so would violate federal election law. So we emailed Freedom Partners and received a reply from spokesman Bill Riggs. "The argument we’re making is that Sen. Merkley has repeatedly cleared the path for more debt and more spending, and it hasn’t helped Oregon," Riggs wrote. "And while there’s no question that his votes to raise the debt ceiling allowed Congress to add more to the debt, the ad should be viewed in full context." While the words on the screen say Merkley voted six times "for more debt," Riggs noted the narrator’s words: "Senator Merkley voted six times to raise the debt limit." Merkley’s office agreed the latter is accurate. In previous interviews, Merkley said the votes were necessary for Congress to pay bills it had already run up. Andrew Zucker, his deputy campaign manager, reiterated that: "In a nutshell, the Koch brothers are blatantly misleading Oregonians by attacking Jeff for voting to reopen the government after the Republican government shutdown, and preventing the government from defaulting on our obligation for the first time in history." So were Merkley’s votes to raise the debt ceiling also votes "for more debt?" According to the U.S. Treasury Department’s website, the debt limit is the "total amount of money that the United States government is authorized to borrow to meet its existing legal obligations." Those include Social Security and Medicare benefits, military salaries, interest on the national debt, tax refunds and other payments. "The debt limit does not authorize new spending commitments," the site says. "It simply allows the government to finance existing legal obligations that Congresses and presidents of both parties have made in the past." We turned to a PolitiFact National piece that checked the question, "Does raising the debt ceiling ‘increase our debt’?" The story, published Oct. 14, 2013, said President Barack Obama was on solid ground when he asserted that a vote to raise the debt ceiling is not commensurate with a vote to "increase our debt.’" The ruling: An ad campaign supporting candidate Monica Wehby, includes words on the screen saying that Sen. Jeff Merkley voted six times "for more debt." However, the U.S. Treasury, and a prior PolitiFact check, note that a vote to raise the debt ceiling does not, by itself, authorize new spending. All it does is authorize the federal government to borrow sufficient funds to pay for debt that has already been incurred. Merkley’s six votes to raise the debt ceiling were not, in other words, votes "for more debt." We rate the claim False.	None	Freedom Partners	None	None	None	2014-08-15T15:51:28	2014-08-06	['None']
pomt-02886	Says 18 states and the District of Columbia have voted Democratic in six consecutive presidential elections.	true	/punditfact/statements/2013/nov/10/george-will/george-will-paints-dire-electoral-picture-gop-says/	The lopsided re-election of New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie has ignited talk about Christie’s 2016 presidential prospects. In his victory speech, Christie, eyes straight at the camera, invited the rest of the country to see what a Republican could achieve in New Jersey. Conservative pundit George Will said the prospect of flipping a blue state could be Christie’s trump card if he does decide to run for president. "He will turn to the Republicans now and say, ‘Your problem is the 18 states and the District of Columbia that have voted democratic in six consecutive presidential elections,’" Will said on Fox News Sunday. "Those 18 states, which include New Jersey by the way, have 242 electoral votes. If the Democratic presidential nominee can assume those states, he or she will spend the autumn of 2016 looking for 28 electoral votes, and he or she will find them." It’s a simple matter of going to the electoral college record to see if Will has his numbers right, and he does. While about one third of the states have moved from one party to the other over the past 24 years, Democrats have been able to hold on to a larger number than Republicans. More importantly, the Democratic states have bigger populations and thus deliver more electoral votes. Democrats can count on the two big prizes of California and New York, while Republicans can counter with just one super-sized state, Texas. The average state in the blue column delivers 13 electoral votes; the average on the red side is 8. Here’s a look at the states that have voted the same way since Bill Clinton was elected in 1992 and the total number of electoral votes they now cast: Democratic since 1992 Electoral votes Republican since 1992 Electoral votes California 55 Alabama 9 Connecticut 7 Alaska 3 D.C. 3 Kansas 6 Delaware 3 Idaho 4 Hawaii 4 Mississippi 6 Illinois 20 Nebraska 5 Maine 4 North Dakota 3 Maryland 10 Oklahoma 7 Massachusetts 11 South Carolina 9 Michigan 16 South Dakota 3 Minnesota 10 Texas 38 New Jersey 14 Utah 6 New York 29 Wyoming 3 Oregon 7 Total 102 Pennsylvania 20 Rhode Island 4 Vermont 3 Washington 12 Wisconsin 10 Total 242 Source: U.S. Electoral College Other Republicans have weighed in on this Democratic advantage. A recent commentary in Red State, a self-described right-of-center website, suggested the problem is even worse than Will said. "After totaling the electoral votes in all the solid blue states, it becomes apparent that even a below average Democrat presidential candidate could begin the race with a whopping 246 advantage," the author said. "No wonder President (Barack) Obama was so confident of victory in 2012 for he knew the game was practically over before it began." University of Virginia political scientist Larry Sabato said the hurdle for Republicans doesn't look any better if you count the underlying votes by citizens, not just the electoral results. "Democrats have also won the popular vote in five of the last six presidential contests," Sabato said. "The demographic shifts heading to mid century are all pro-Democratic." Our ruling Will said Democrats have taken 18 states and the District of Columbia in every presidential election since 1992. The record backs that up. We rate the claim True.

pomt-01224	Scott Walker "couldn’t get his own party" to back more than a 500-student increase in Milwaukee’s school choice program, but in Indiana, "Mitch Daniels’ voucher program is approaching 30,000 students two years after opening."	half-true	/wisconsin/statements/2014/nov/21/joy-pullmann/joy-pullmann-says-scott-walker-couldnt-get-legisla/	Gov. Scott Walker’s re-election on Nov. 4, 2014, drew plenty of love from conservative commentators bullish about his chances to make a splash in the 2016 presidential race. "The Nation Needs President Scott Walker in 2016," shouted a headline over a story by Richard Cromwell in The Federalist, an online magazine. But not everyone on the right was leading cheers. Same magazine, different take: "Winning Re-Election Doesn’t Mean Scott Walker Is Ready For 2016." The author of that Nov. 11 piece is the managing editor of the magazine, Joy Pullmann, an education researcher at the conservative Heartland Institute based in Chicago. Pullmann has dogged Walker on several issues, including what she views as his belated shift to oppose the Common Core state standards for schools. One week after Walker topped Democrat Mary Burke, Pullmann -- a former teacher and self-described "born and raised Wisconsin farm girl" -- again was talking down Walker’s accomplishments. She argued his moves to boost private schools with public money, cut taxes and all but end public-sector collective bargaining were half measures. Aside from going after public employee unions, she argued, Walker has been too nice and too passive. In particular she cited "a pitiful 500-student increase to Milwaukee’s voucher program, the nation’s oldest, because Walker couldn’t get his own party members to back a real expansion despite full control of Wisconsin’s legislative and executive branches." She added: "Whoop de doo. In Indiana, Mitch Daniels’ voucher program is approaching 30,000 students two years after opening. He knew how to work with his legislature — and they ain’t any less ornery and squishy than Wisconsin Republicans." Did Daniels -- a Walker favorite who served two terms as governor ending in 2013 -- spectacularly outdo Walker on school vouchers despite favorable political conditions for the GOP in Madison? At first glance, the programs appear pretty similar. Wisconsin currently pays for 29,683 students to attend non-public schools. In Indiana, the figure also tops 29,000. But most of the growth in the Wisconsin program long pre-dates Walker, while Indiana has surged to Wisconsin’s level in just four years. Daniels won passage of the program in 2011, the same year Walker’s first term began in Wisconsin. In Wisconsin, vouchers were born 25 years ago through a Milwaukee-only program. It was a pioneering effort nationally in the use of public tax dollars to enable parents to send their children to private and/or religious schools. It was under Walker that the program expanded beyond Milwaukee, to more than 25 municipalities. But Pullmann alludes, accurately, to the fact Daniels was able to get vouchers approved statewide right from the get-go, while Walker settled for a gradual and limited expansion even with a Republican-controlled Legislature and a 2012 recall win under his belt. She misstates some facts and undersells Walker’s record on vouchers, though, in saying he won a mere "500-student increase to Milwaukee’s voucher program." Walker did cap the increase at 500 additional students in 2013-’14. But that cap of 500 students is old news; the statewide limit went up to 1,000 new students for 2014-’15. Also left out of the equation are earlier expansions on Walker’s watch. Walker lifted Milwaukee’s 22,500 enrollment limit in 2011. He also signed the expansion of the program to Racine in 2011-’12. All these moves combined to allow more than 5,000 new students into the program annually, 10 times the amount Pullmann credits him for. By contrast, Indiana went from 0 to more than 29,000 in four years. The program there was capped at 7,500 its first year and at 15,000 in its second, but now has no cap. Wisconsin’s program outside Milwaukee and Racine is still capped at 1,000 students, though Walker and legislators have signalled they want to raise that limit in the next term. Voucher advocate Kara Kerwin, president of the Center for Education Reform, said Pullmann was right to describe Walker’s approach as incrementalism compared to the Indiana experience. But "Indiana was in a different position because others had already paved the road," Kerwin said. Both states fared very well in the Center’s 2014 state scorecard on voucher plans. Indiana ranked #1 ("a universal voucher program open to all students across the state and no limit on the number of vouchers that can be awarded.") Wisconsin tied for #2 ("a much-restricted statewide program, both in terms of income eligibility and number of available vouchers.") Finally, the political front. Walker faced the reality that some GOP senators balked at expanding the program beyond Milwaukee and Racine. He proposed a cap, but one that would expire; legislators made the 1,000-student limit indefinite. We asked Walker press secretary Laurel Patrick why the Republican governor proposed a cap on out-state enrollment. "Our office worked with the Legislature and this was the avenue that had the most support, especially due to concerns about funding and the capacity for expansion," Patrick told us. Our rating Pullmann wrote that Scott Walker "couldn’t get his own party" to back more than a 500-student increase in Milwaukee’s school choice program, but in Indiana, "Mitch Daniels’ voucher program is approaching 30,000 students two years after opening." She’s on target on the basic notion of Indiana’s speed vs. Wisconsin’s gradualism, but leaves out or muffs some important details. We rate her claim Half True.

pomt-01651	"The majority of Austinites rent" the places they live.	true	/texas/statements/2014/aug/22/mike-martinez/mike-martinez-says-majority-austin-residents-are-r/	After an Austin mayoral candidate proposed to permanently cut homeowner taxes, City Council Member Mike Martinez said the idea wouldn’t benefit most residents. Martinez, also a candidate for mayor, reacted after attorney Steve Adler said the council could have created a city homestead exemption, or tax break for homeowners, years before. "We need to act," Adler said Aug. 4, 2014, according to an Austin American-Statesman news story that day. Adler called for a 20 percent exemption--as in a 20 percent cut to each home’s taxable value--at a city-estimated cost of $36 million a year. Martinez and a third mayoral aspirant, City Council Member Sheryl Cole, said Adler’s idea revealed his lack of governing experience. Martinez said: "This would be $36 million that would benefit the wealthiest Austinites the most. The majority of Austinites rent and would see no financial benefit at all." We wondered about Martinez’s statement that most Austin residents rent, rather than own, the places they live. We did not delve into his contention that renters wouldn’t benefit from Adler’s proposal. To our inquiry, a Martinez campaign spokesman, Nick Hudson, pointed out a July 31, 2014, city report including an illustration stating that 183,000 of the city’s 331,000 households in 2012 (55 percent) were renters--a proportion in keeping with trends in 2000 and 2008, the report says. By contrast, 148,000 households, 45 percent, were owners. Hudson also forwarded a web link to a city-generated chart drawing on the 2010 U.S. Census indicating 51 percent of Austin’s residents were renters that year. To get our own fix on this, we queried Lloyd Potter, the Texas state demographer, who said by email Martinez’s claim is supported by the best available resource, American Community Survey data annually gathered by the U.S. Census Bureau. According to the surveys taken from 2010 through 2012, Potter said, 418,138, or 52 percent, of an estimated 799,183 Austin residents lived in rental units compared with 381,045 residents, or 48 percent, who were owners. He said the 2012 survey alone suggests 432,400, 53 percent, of the city’s 823,340 residents were renters compared with 390,940, nearly 48 percent, who were owners, Potter said. Separately, a bureau spokesman, Robert Bernstein, responded to our inquiry by emailing a chart based on the bureau’s 2012 survey suggesting there were more "housing units" rented in Austin than units that were occupied by owners. According to the survey, 183,080 of 330,838 housing units (55 percent) were renter-occupied with 147,758 (45 percent) being owner-occupied. (We suspect these figures were the basis of the information in the report noted by Martinez’s camp.) Occupied housing units 2012 American Community Survey 1-Year Estimates Source: U.S. Census Bureau, 2012 American Community Survey (chart received by email from Robert Bernstein of the bureau).

pomt-10292	John McCain worries about nuclear waste in Arizona, but not in Nevada.	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/aug/13/barack-obama/mccain-thinks-yucca-site-will-be-more-secure/	An ad from Barack Obama zings John McCain about a proposal to store the nation's nuclear waste in Nevada, at a site called Yucca Mountain. The Yucca Mountain project is the result of a quest by the U.S. Energy Department to create a remote, long-term underground storage facility for spent nuclear material and hazardous waste generated by nuclear power plants and weapons development. It has been a controversial proposal, especially in Nevada. As you might guess, many Nevada voters oppose the Yucca Mountain project, and candidates who visit the state are regularly questioned about it. The original opening date was 1998, but opposition has prevented the project from going forward and its fate is unclear. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., is a powerful opponent. Obama has urged that the project be shelved. McCain, on the other hand, supports the project. It's more dangerous, he has said, to have nuclear waste stored next to active reactors at multiple sites around the country. The Energy Department says that nuclear waste is currently stored at more than 120 sites in 39 states. The Obama ad, which is airing only in Nevada, includes a brief clip of interview footage with McCain. Here's the heart of the ad's transcript: Narrator: "Imagine trucks hauling the nation's nuclear waste on our highways to Yucca Mountain? John McCain supports opening Yucca. He's not worried about nuclear waste in our state — only in Arizona." Interviewer: "Would you be comfortable with nuclear waste coming through Arizona on its way, you know going through Phoenix, on its way to Yucca Mountain?" McCain: "No, I would not. No, I would not." Narrator: "John McCain. For nuclear waste in Nevada, just not in his backyard." The interview snippet takes only a brief portion of McCain's remarks. His full answer is, "No, I would not. No, I would not. I think it can be made safe, and again we have two options here. What people forget is the option of leaving this waste in areas outside, maybe unprotected or certainly not well protected, all over America rather than having it in a safe and secure repository for it. I prefer not having the status quo, and I think it's also a national security issue. I think these areas would be ripe for terrorist attacks." A bit of controversy has erupted in the Nevada media about the ad and its meaning. The interview is from a syndicated, privately produced news show called "Nevada Newsmakers," hosted by journalist Sam Shad. One Las Vegas columnist believes that McCain misspoke in the interview, that his full answer indicated McCain would be okay with nuclear waste being transported through Arizona. "Now why would McCain emphasize how the waste 'can be made safe' if he weren't trying to emphasize he would have no worries about the substance passing through Phoenix?" asked Joe Ralston, writing in the Las Vegas Sun. "Obviously, he thought Shad was asking him whether he felt comfortable with waste going through Arizona and answered too quickly. So the central point of the ad — that McCain would be wary of it in Arizona but not in Nevada — is simply false." Shad, who conducted the interview, disagrees with that interpretation. He said he thinks McCain was answering honestly that he opposes nuclear waste being trucked through a major metro area like Phoenix, and that McCain was simply moving on quickly to a point he preferred to make — that the Yucca Mountain proposal is better than the status quo. McCain would not want to be filmed saying that trucking nuclear waste through his hometown is fine by him, Shad said. "This is not a stupid guy," Shad said. "This is a very smart guy." Shad, though, has demanded that the Obama campaign stop airing the commercial. (As of this writing, the footage is still available and presumably airing.) Shad said he hadn't given the campaign permission to use the footage. "It's not a partisan thing," he told PolitiFact.com. "They don't just have the right. It's a copyright issue. It's my video and my audio. Who's going to want to come on the program if they find themselves in a campaign ad later?" The editing of the video makes McCain appear "glib," Shad said, when his answer was more substantive. So what do we make of all this? We asked the McCain campaign for an explanation on the transportation issue and didn't hear back. What is clear is that the Obama campaign edited the video in a way that omits the main point of McCain's statement. McCain was making a logical case for Yucca Mountain based on issues of safety and security. Whether you agree with his views or not, it's clear from the interview that he supports the project for substantive reasons that have little to do with keeping nuclear waste out of his home state. The ad makes McCain appear to support a simplistic "not in my backyard" argument, which distorts his views significantly. For these reasons, we find the statement that McCain is worried about nuclear waste in Arizona but not in Nevada to be Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.

pomt-09741	Forty-five percent of doctors "say they'll quit" if health care reform passes.	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/oct/15/glenn-beck/beck-says-45-percent-physicians-would-quit-if-heal/	Physicians are important players in the health care debate. They've been courted by both supporters and opponents of the Democratic reform plan. President Barack Obama held a Rose Garden ceremony with some of them recently. And now opponents of the Democratic health care plan are citing poll results that supposedly show that lots of doctors would be so unhappy with the reforms that they'd quit their jobs. Fox News Channel political commentator Glenn Beck mentioned this on his Oct. 12, 2009, show during a wide-ranging critique of the Democratic plan. He said that the plan could harm doctors financially and make medical students have doubts about pursuing the profession. "Do you really think that you're going to see an increase in medical students? I don't think so," Beck said. "Especially consider that the percentage of doctors who say they'll quit if this is passed is only 45 percent. No worries. Ha! You'll be able to find a good doctor. Really, you will." If true, the sudden departure of 45 percent of the nation's doctors would indeed constitute a stinging rejection of the Democratic effort by an influential health care constituency. But that number sounded high to us, so we decided to look into the statistic's origins. It came from a survey of "practicing physicians" published in mid September. The survey was sponsored by the newspaper Investor's Business Daily and was done by the firm TechnoMetrica Institute of Policy and Politics, or TIPP. The survey was conducted between Aug. 28, 2009, and Sept. 15, 2009. It was mailed to 25,600 physicians nationwide at addresses purchased from a list broker. We found several problems with the poll and the way Beck described its results: • Beck misstated what the poll asked . Beck said that 45 percent of doctors will quit. But in fact, the poll found that 45 percent of doctors said they will consider quitting. Considering quitting isn't the same thing as quitting, which makes Beck's statement a significant exaggeration. In addition, the specific question asked of respondents was, "If Congress passes their health care plan, will you ... continue your practice, [or] consider leaving your practice or taking an early retirement?" This wording leaves open the possibility that respondents are saying they might simply leave their current practice to join another practice, rather than quit. • The poll had a low response rate . According to the statistics published in IBD , 1,376 practicing physicians responded to the poll, out of the 25,600 solicited nationally. That's a 5.4 percent response rate. In one of its articles about the poll, IBD bills this as "a high rate of return, considering how difficult doctors are to get hold of." But another survey of doctors released around the same time managed to do better — much better. That other survey was conducted by Salomeh Keyhani and Alex Federman, internists and researchers at the Mount Sinai School of Medicine in New York City, who published the results in the New England Journal of Medicine . They mailed 5,157 questionnaires and got a response rate that exceeded 43 percent — nearly eight times the IBD survey's rate. In fact, Keyhani and Federman reached almost 50 percent more doctors despite sending out only one-fifth the number of inquiries. (They did not ask doctors if they would consider quitting as the other poll did.) Does a higher response rate matter? In this case, it's hard to know for sure, said Karlyn Bowman, a polling analyst with the conservative American Enterprise Institute. However, she added, "higher response rates give me more confidence in results," a point echoed by other experts we interviewed. • The sponsor was listed prominently on the survey, possibly influencing who responded . The survey was sent out on Investor’s Business Daily letterhead, and the introduction said in part, "The results of this survey will be on Investor’s Business Daily’s front page and investors.com. A press release will also be prepared. This will give doctors a voice in this key issue." This type of framing matters because IBD 's editorial page is known for its conservative stance, including opposition to the Democratic health care effort. While it’s safe to assume that not everyone who received the survey knew about IBD 's political leanings, some respondents presumably did — and among those who did, such knowledge could have made a difference in determining who responded. Liberals might have been less likely to respond, while conservatives in tune with the IBD editorials would have been more enthusiastic about responding. In such a small sample, even a modest bias of that sort could skew the results. • The wording of questions may have influenced who responded . In an interview, Mark Blumenthal, who blogs at pollster.com and has written critically of the IBD poll, said the wording of the questions could have skewed the results. He noted that, unlike telephone polls, mail polls enable the recipient to skim the entire list of questions before deciding to answer any of them. With the IBD poll, respondents might have thought some of the questions had a subtext that was critical of the Democratic proposal. One was, "Do you believe the government can cover 47 million more people and it will cost less money and the quality of care will be better?" Another was, "If Congress passes their plan, do you expect fewer students to apply to med schools in the future [or] more students to apply to med schools in the future?" A third was, "Under a government plan, do you think drug companies will have incentives to continue developing as many life saving new drugs?" (Grammatical errors in original; full survey text available here.) "Collectively, these questions imply that health care reform will mean very bad things for medicine," Blumenthal said. "I'm guessing that a proreform doctor would be inclined to ignore, and not return, a survey if the questions seem leading or biased." Could the prominence of the IBD name and the question wording have made a difference? The evidence suggests that may be true. In the IBD poll, 65 percent of the doctors who responded said they opposed "government's proposed health care plan" while just 33 percent supported it. By contrast, the Keyhani-Federman poll found that 63 percent of doctors surveyed favored giving patients a choice between public and private insurance, as congressional Democrats and President Barack Obama have advocated. Another 10 percent said they favored a single-payer health care system — a solution that is actually to the left of the president. In other words, the results of the two polls are so far apart that they are essentially opposites. The truth may actually lie somewhere in between the two surveys. It's worth noting that the Keyhani-Federman poll received financial support from the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, which favors health care reform. Also, National Public Radio has said that "Keyhani and Federman belong to ... the National Physicians Alliance. It supports a public option, and Keyhani has spoken publicly about her own support for a public option." A campaign finance database search found that both researchers donated to the Obama campaign in 2008 — $500 from Keyhani and $300 from Federman. In addition, the initial postcard Keyhani and Federman sent to doctors included the subheading, "Congress wants to hear from doctors on health care reform" — advocacy-style language similar to what the IBD poll said. This may have produced some ideological bias in the opposite direction from IBD 's poll. (In an interview, Federman said the reason for choosing the words they did stemmed from "what the literature shows about what works to get docs to respond to surveys.") Finally, Don Dillman, an expert in mail-based polls and a professor at Washington State University, suggests another factor that could make the IBD poll results on doctors quitting vastly overstated: People don't usually make decisions about changing careers lightly. "If one is trained to be a physician, then are you going to take on another occupation?" he asks. This concern is especially relevant for younger physicians, who would likely find few new careers that would earn them enough income to pay off their debts from attending medical school. So, back to Beck's statement. First, he misstated the results of the poll. The survey didn't say 45 percent would quit; it said they would consider quitting, which is considerably different. Moreover, polling experts have raised significant questions about the poll's methodology. Of special concern are the combination of the heavy mention of IBD 's name and questions that experts said appeared to be seeking answers critical of health reform. We'd like to see an independent poll assessing doctors' views of health care reform, but neither the findings from the IBD survey nor those from the Keyhani-Federman study are fully persuasive to us. We rate Beck's statement False.	None	Glenn Beck	None	None	None	2009-10-15T16:12:17	2009-10-12	['None']
pomt-06678	Utah was "the No. 1 job creator in this country during my years of service" as governor, with a 5.9 percent increase in jobs.	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/sep/08/jon-huntsman/jon-huntsman-says-utah-was-no-1-job-creation-when-/	During the Sept. 7, 2011, Republican presidential debate at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library, former Utah Gov. Jon Huntsman tried to burnish his economic credentials. Taking a swipe at Texas Gov. Rick Perry, another Republican presidential candidate, Huntsman said, "I hate to rain on the parade of the Lone Star governor, but as governor of Utah, we were the No. 1 job creator in this country during my years of service. That was 5.9 percent when you were creating jobs at 4.9 percent." We decided to check whether Huntsman was right -- and in a tale that only a statistical economist could love, we found that the answer is a lot more complicated than you might expect. When we asked the Huntsman campaign for data to back up the claim, they directed us to a blog post at National Review Online, the website of the well-known conservative magazine. The item, posted June 20, 2011, compared employment statistics for several governors. "During Huntsman’s tenure, January 2005 to August 2009, Utah had the best overall job-growth rate of any state in the nation," the item said. "In that same time frame, Perry’s job-growth rate was 4.9 percent. (Minnesota Gov. Tim) Pawlenty’s job-growth rate was negative: The number of jobs in Minnesota decreased by 1.8 percent." At PolitiFact, we always double-check data in media reports against official statistics, so we did so here as well. We turned to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the government’s official source of employment statistics. We looked at the Current Employment Statistics database for each of the 50 states and subtracted the number of jobs in January 2005 from the number in August 2009. As it happens, this period was split between an expansion (2005 through 2007) and a deep recession (2008 and 2009), so a majority of states actually lost jobs over that period. Utah was not one of the job-losing states -- but it also wasn’t No. 1 in the nation, according to this set of statistics, and it actually trailed Texas, undercutting Huntsman’s jab at Perry. Here are the four states with the fastest employment growth over the period when Huntsman was governor: 1. Wyoming: 9.5 percent increase 2. North Dakota: 7.5 percent increase 3. Texas: 6.5 percent increase 4. Utah: 4.8 percent increase So Huntsman’s claim gets a False, right? Not so fast. When we showed our math to the Huntsman camp, they stood by their numbers. They sent us to a page for the state of Utah on the BLS website that backed up the claim Huntsman made during the debate -- the number of jobs in Utah rose by 5.9 percent over the period. Using the equivalent pages for the other three states, we found that Utah exceeded them all -- Texas grew by 4.9 percent, as Huntsman indicated, while Wyoming grew by 4 percent and North Dakota grew by 3 percent. Using these figures, Huntsman was correct. So what gives? When we checked with the BLS, a spokesman explained that the way we calculated the numbers and the way the Huntsman camp calculated the numbers are different because the numbers come from different data sets. The data we used come from the Current Employment Statistics, a monthly study of the payroll data at 400,000 businesses, whereas the Huntsman campaign was using data from the Current Population Survey, which is based on a survey of about 60,000 households. Is one of these data set preferred in this context? The BLS’s answer is yes -- and the preferred method is not the one used by the Huntsman campaign. "BLS uses changes in the payroll survey to describe job gain or loss," said spokesman Gary Steinberg. One additional observation, which won’t affect our rating, but which we think is worth pointing out: Utah’s job growth during Huntsman’s tenure didn’t keep pace with the state’s population growth. Utah’s estimated population grew by 11.4 percent during the Huntsman era, more than twice the rate of job growth as measured by the Current Employment Statistics data. Texas’ population growth over that period (8.7 percent) also outpaced its job growth. However, in the two smaller states, job growth did outpace population growth -- North Dakota, with a population increase of 1.8 percent, and Wyoming, with a population increase of 7.5 percent. Then again, it’s also worth noting that 34 states lost jobs between January 2005 and August 2009, so any increase in jobs is noteworthy. Our ruling Huntsman’s campaign is able to point to government data to support its position that Utah was the No. 1 job creator in the U.S. during Huntsman’s tenure, and we see no evidence that they cherry-picked the data. Still, the BLS itself considers the data set used by the campaign to be less appropriate for the kind of comparison Huntsman is making, and, using the proper data set, Utah is fourth -- pretty high, but not first, as Huntsman said. On balance, we rate his statement Half True.	None	Jon Huntsman	None	None	None	2011-09-08T16:11:51	2011-09-07	['Utah']
pomt-13128	"In many instances, (people's) health care costs are more than their mortgage costs or their rent, which, by the way, is a first in American history."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/nov/02/donald-trump/average-donald-trump-comparison-health-care-housin/	Health care was the theme of a Donald Trump rally Nov. 1 in Valley Forge, Pa., so it was not surprising that Trump focused on the projected price increases in policies offered under the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare. "People all across the country are devastated. In many instances, their health care costs are more than their mortgage costs or their rent which, by the way, is a first in American history," Trump said. "This is particularly unfair to millennials and younger Americans generally who will be totally crushed by these massive health care costs before they even get started on their journey through life." We know health care costs have been going up relentlessly, even before Obamacare, and we also know that housing costs, which once made up about one quarter of a household's expenses, have been eating up a larger share of the family budget. So we wondered if Trump's characterization of the relative costs over time was accurate. The Trump campaign didn't get back to us when we asked for the source of the candidate's claim. So we asked some experts. Most pointed us to the Bureau of Labor Statistics' Consumer Expenditure Survey, which has been tracking Americans' expenses since 1984. That's the data we'll use. Housing costs made up 32.9 percent of annual expenses in 2015. Health care was just 7.8 percent. But it's more complicated than that. A lot of extra costs are packed into the housing costs — more than just mortgage and rent bills — and a lot of costs aren't included in the health care number. Here's how the numbers unpack. Housing Those annual housing costs, which average $18,409, include a lot more than mortgage payments and rent. They also fold in utilities, property taxes, repairs, furnishings, housekeeping supplies, appliances and equipment. The data don't list total mortgage bills. The BLS does list mortgage interest in charges, so for simplicity we'll focus on that. For people who own a house, the average yearly interest expense in 2015 was $8,169. (It gets a little complicated because the BLS number had to be adjusted for the fact that about 35 percent of households were made up of owners with a mortgage. In this analysis, we're not including people who own their homes outright.) For renters, who made up 38 percent of households, the average rent in 2015 was $10,005 per year, according to our adjusted BLS data. Health care Health care costs are even more complicated because many people get at least a portion of their health insurance paid by an employer or the government, and the BLS survey doesn't take that into consideration. If everyone were forced to buy their own health insurance, those costs would make up a lot more than 7.8 percent of the family budget. Nonetheless, the 7.8 percent spent per household on health care in 2015 represents a national average of $4,342 per year, $2,977 of which is spent on health insurance, $791 on medical services, $425 on drugs and $149 on medical supplies. Because Trump specifically referred to health care costs, rent and mortgage costs, here's the comparison for 2015: Health care: $4,342 Rent: $10,005 Mortgage interest (without principle): $8,169 So out-of-pocket health care costs are just 43 percent of when the average renter pays and 53 percent of what the average homeowner with a mortgage pays in interest. For recent home buyers and the self-insured under Obamacare, Dean Baker, co-director of the left-leaning Center for Economic Policy and Research in Washington, said it's important to remember that while health costs have been rising, homeowners have been benefiting from "the extraordinarily low mortgage interest rates of the last seven years." "A 30-year mortgage at 4 percent on $200,000 (80 percent of the median house price of $250,000) would cost around $11,500 a year," he said in an email. When it comes to health insurance, "a family of four getting a silver plan without any subsidy would pay a bit over $11,000. If the mortgage rate was 5 percent, the annual cost of the mortgage (just interest and principle, no insurance or taxes) would be just under $13,000. If it was 6 percent, then the cost would be $14,400," so Obamacare would cost less. On the other hand, someone buying Obamacare now might find it far more expensive than the mortgage payment set up 20 years ago when housing prices were much lower. Historical trends Trump said this is "a first in American history." This, too, is incorrect. We took the BLS data and calculated the percentage of annual expenses for mortgage interest, rent and health care. Note that the first Obamacare plans sold through the insurance marketplaces took effect in 2014. Out-of-pocket health care costs have been rising, according to the BLS data, but they're not close to converging, even though prices have been rising steadily as premiums have gone up, deductibles and co-pays have increased, and employers have shifted more of those rising costs to their workers. From a broader perspective, and one that includes government and employee costs for health care, data from the Bureau of Economic Analysis show that the United States is now spending significantly more on health care ($2.6 trillion in 2015) than on housing ($1.9 trillion). "The aggregate health care consumption numbers have been higher than aggregate housing expenditures for a number of years now," said Jeffrey Clemens, a professor of health economics at the University of California San Diego. Our ruling Trump said, "In many instances, (people's) health care costs are more than their mortgage costs or their rent, which, by the way, is a first in American history." This is a bit of an apples-and-oranges comparison. He is comparing total health care costs but not total housing costs, looking at only mortgage and rental costs. To further complicate matters, per-person health care costs far more than what most households pay because many get their health insurance subsidized by employers or the government. With those caveats in mind, the federal data show Trump is, on average, incorrect. But the candidate fudged it a bit, and given individual circumstances it's certainly possible that some households are, in fact, seeing higher health care bills than what they're paying on their rent and mortgage. So we rate this claim Mostly False.https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/4549f29a-a2e2-49dd-8fff-34d70628f2be	None	Donald Trump	None	None	None	2016-11-02T18:20:27	2016-11-01	['United_States']
pomt-05775	"President Obama once said he wants everybody in America to go to college."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/feb/27/rick-santorum/rick-santorum-calls-barack-obama-snob-wanting-ever/	Republican presidential candidate Rick Santorum kicked up a media storm when he slammed President Barack Obama as a "snob" at an Americans for Prosperity forum in Troy, Mich., on Feb. 25, 2012. "President Obama once said he wants everybody in America to go to college," Santorum said. "What a snob. There are good, decent men and women who go out and work hard every day and put their skills to test that aren't taught by some liberal college professor that (tries) to indoctrinate them." The issue received such attention that Obama on Feb. 27 addressed the issue obliquely, telling the National Governors Association that "the jobs of the future are increasingly going to those with more than a high school degree. And I have to make a point here. When I speak about higher education, we’re not just talking about a four-year degree. We’re talking about somebody going to a community college and getting trained for that manufacturing job that now is requiring somebody walking through the door, handling a million-dollar piece of equipment. And they can’t go in there unless they’ve got some basic training beyond what they received in high school. We all want Americans getting those jobs of the future. So we’re going to have to make sure that they’re getting the education that they need." Obama has made no secret that he encourages Americans to go to college and has pursued policies to expand access to those who want to go. But we received a number of requests from readers to see whether Obama went so far as to say that he "wants everybody in America to go to college." We didn’t hear back from the Santorum campaign, but we looked into Obama’s past speeches, using both Nexis and the White House website, to locate instances in which he broached the topic. We found 18 examples. All but three of them make clear that Obama does not expect every young American to attend a traditional four-year, bachelors-degree-granting college or university or even a community college. In three cases, Obama did say something closer to what Santorum suggested, but still not enough to justify Santorum's claim. In seven sets of remarks, Obama focused not on having every young American attend college, but rather making college a possibility for every American who wants to attend, particularly making it more affordable. Here are two that were typical (the full list is available here). • A letter by Barack Obama to his daughters, published in Parade magazine, Jan. 2009. "In the end, girls, that's why I ran for President: because of what I want for you and for every child in this nation. I want all our children to go to schools worthy of their potential—schools that challenge them, inspire them, and instill in them a sense of wonder about the world around them. I want them to have the chance to go to college—even if their parents aren't rich." • Remarks at the Biltmore Hotel, Coral Gables, Fla., Feb. 23, 2012. "When kids graduate, I want them to be able to afford to go to college. If they've been working hard, if they've gotten the grades to go to college, I don't want them to cut their dreams short because they don't think they can afford it." In another four speeches, Obama focused on community colleges as an alternative to the traditional, four-year college experience. Here is one example: • Remarks at a Democratic issues conference, Jan. 27, 2012. "They don't all have to go to four-year colleges and universities -- although we need more engineers and we need more scientists, and we've got to make sure that college is affordable and accessible. But we also need skilled workers who are going to community colleges, or middle-aged workers who are allowed to retrain, have a commitment to work, have that work ethic, but want to make sure that technology is not passing them by -- and so focusing on our community colleges, and making sure that they're matched up with businesses that are hiring right now, and making sure that they help to design the programs that are going to put them -- put people in place to get those jobs right away." In another four speeches, Obama was quite explicit about encouraging Americans to pursue either a college education or vocational training, apprenticeships or lifelong retraining. What he said in his first address to a joint session of Congress was typical: • Address to a Joint Session of Congress, Feb. 24, 2009. "Tonight, I ask every American to commit to at least one year or more of higher education or career training. This can be community college or a four-year school; vocational training or an apprenticeship. But whatever the training may be, every American will need to get more than a high school diploma." Judging by these 15 speeches, it’s possible to conclude that Obama favors giving all Americans the chance to get a university education if they wish, and opening up other opportunities for education beyond high school for those who do not, from community colleges to vocational training to apprenticeships. Finally, in three speeches Obama said something a little closer to what Santorum claimed he said. For instance, in remarks at a Democratic National committee fundraiser in Austin, Texas, on May 10, 2011, he said: "Our reforms are not done. I want every child in Texas and every child in America ready to graduate, ready to go to college, and actually able to afford going to college. That's how we're going to out-compete and out-educate the rest of the world. That's how America will succeed in the 21st century." Meanwhile, at a Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee dinner in Minneapolis, Minn., on Oct. 23, 2010, Obama said, "We've got to make sure that every young person in America is prepared for college and then can afford to go to college." And at a Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee dinner in Rockville, Md., on Oct. 18, 2010, Obama said, "How do we make sure that every young person can go to college once they get through that high school?" Our ruling Santorum claimed that Obama "once said he wants everybody in America to go to college." We found 18 statements from Obama about people attending college. In the vast majority of the 18, Obama talked about making college a possibility or included the option of attending community colleges or vocational training instead. We found three that offered partial support for Santorum's claim, but their tenor was mainly about opening doors for people who want to go to college, not a clear desire that everyone enroll. We rate the claim False. UPDATE: Santorum backtracked on this claim during the March 4, 2012, edition of Fox News Sunday after being pressed by host Chris Wallace, the Boston Globe reported. "I've read some columns where at least it was characterized that the president said, we should go to four-year colleges," Santorum said, adding, "If it was in error, then I agree with the president that we should have options for people to go to variety of different training options for them."

pomt-02192	Says Cory Gardner "championed an eight-year crusade to outlaw birth control here in Colorado."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2014/apr/25/mark-udall/mark-udall-says-cory-gardner-championed-colorado-f/	Women, particularly single women, voted strongly for President Barack Obama and other Democrats in 2012. Hoping to replicate that success, Democrats this year are hammering Republicans on women’s health issues in the early stages of the 2014 midterm campaign season. A good example is Colorado, where Democratic Sen. Mark Udall is expected to face Rep. Cory Gardner, R-Colo., in November. Udall recently released a 30-second ad attacking Gardner on abortion and birth control. "Congressman Cory Gardner’s history promoting harsh anti-abortion laws is disturbing," the narrator says. "Gardner sponsored a bill to make abortion a felony, including cases of rape and incest. Gardner even championed an eight-year crusade to outlaw birth control here in Colorado." Udall’s campaign said Gardner’s "crusade to outlaw birth control" stems from his support of efforts to add so-called "personhood" language that would define life beginning at fertilization to the Colorado Constitution. Opponents of personhood legislation say that giving a fertilized egg all the rights of person could make illegal several FDA-approved contraceptives. (More on that in a bit.) Anti-abortion groups successfully petitioned to get personhood measures on the Colorado ballot in 2008 and 2010. Both times it was rejected by more than 70 percent of voters. In a further complication, Gardner recently made a major about-face, saying he no longer supports the personhood movement, partly because he now thinks it could potentially impact access to certain forms of birth control. "The fact that it restricts contraception, it was not the right position," Gardner told The Denver Post. "I've learned to listen. I don't get everything right the first time." Despite this, Gardner’s camp still contends Udall’s ad is misleading because Gardner thought he was supporting an anti-abortion measure, not a referendum on birth control. Gardner’s campaign argues that it’s an exaggeration of his position to claim that he’s "championed" a "crusade to outlaw birth control." What are we to make of this? We can’t predict how the courts would interpret personhood legislation or its impact on legal birth control. Though even Gardner acknowledges that some contraceptives could be at risk if personhood passed, a lot of legal ambiguity remains. Because no state has passed a personhood measure, we don’t know how it could impact specific types of contraceptives. As we’ve noted in past articles about the debate over personhood, some legal scholars and the medical community have cautioned that it could potentially impact access to birth control. In a 2011 op-ed to the New York Times, Glenn Cohen, co-director of the Center for Health Law Policy, Biotechnology and Bioethics at Harvard University, and Jonathan Will, law professor at Mississippi College, said what is considered "fertilization" is not even clear. Fertilization could mean at least four different things: "penetration of the egg by a sperm," successful combination of the genetic information from sperm and egg, activation of the genetic information, and "implantation of the embryo in the uterus," Cohen and Will wrote. Sperm penetration occurs almost immediately, but implantation can take up to two weeks. "Thus, on some reasonable readings of the amendment, certain forms of birth control ... would seem impermissible, while on other equally reasonable readings they are not." Therefore, it is difficult to know how courts would react, especially considering that past rulings have affirmed the right of access to birth control. A personhood law could present proponents an opportunity to challenge those rulings. So we’re left trying to determine whether Gardner’s past positions in support of personhood could reasonably be considered as championing a crusade against birth control. Gardner’s history In 2006, Colorado Right to Life asked all politicians running for office if they supported the Right to Life Act in Congress, "recognizing that personhood begins at fertilization." Gardner, then a first-term state representative answered yes. Udall’s campaign provided a television news story from March 17, 2008, that appears to briefly show Gardner in a room with several Republican colleagues signing on to the petition to put personhood on the Colorado ballot (around the 1-minute mark). Gardner’s campaign did not respond to questions about his support of the 2008 referendum. His campaign did, however, acknowledge that Gardner supported the referendum efforts in 2010 at a candidate forum. In a video clip from the forum, Gardner says he signed the petition and circulated it at his church. He also said the measure "backs up my support for life," but did not mention contraceptives or birth control. News stories from Colorado papers in 2008 and 2010 mention the debate over contraceptives involved in personhood legislation. In fact, Ken Buck, the 2010 Republican candidate for U.S. Senate in Colorado, backed away from his previous support of the personhood referendum because he said it could impact some forms of birth control. So contraception was a live issue at the time. But Cohen, the Harvard professor, told PolitiFact that "it is unclear that the Colorado 2008 and 2010 referendums were intended to ‘outlaw birth control in Colorado’ — that's what the word ‘crusade’ seems to imply. It is more clear that the language of those amendments might have outlawed some forms of birth control, whether that was the goal or not." In other words, Gardner may have been in favor of the amendment, but for reasons other than curbing contraception. Since getting elected to Congress in 2010, Gardner has co-sponsored the Life Begins at Conception Act in 2012 and 2013, which has been described as federal personhood legislation. But he was hardly alone in doing so, nor was he an early backer. In 2012, he was one of the final cosponsors of 120 lawmakers, joining a full 14 months after the bill was introduced. In 2013, the bill had 128 sponsors, with Gardner signing on four months after introduction. Gardner’s campaign notes that in 2007, he was one of five to cosponsor an anti-abortion measure in Colorado that specified that "nothing in this section shall prohibit the sale, use, prescription or administration of a contraceptive measure, device, drug or chemical." This bill, his campaign said, demonstrates that while Gardner is pro-life, he is not anti-contraceptive. Udall’s campaign, though, noted Gardner also voted against the "Birth Control Protection Act" in 2009, a response to the 2008 personhood ballot referendum, which became law. Our ruling Udall’s ad said Gardner "championed an eight-year crusade to outlaw birth control here in Colorado." It’s clear Gardner has supported personhood in the past, and it’s hard for him to claim ignorance about the measure’s threat to contraception, given the media attention that aspect of the law attracted at the time. Gardner also voted against a bill that would have legally protected birth control. Still, the effort is probably more accurately described as a crusade against abortion than against birth control, and "championed" is also a strong word to describe Gardner’s role, since it implies that he was a leader in the cause. Udall’s ad is partially accurate but leaves out important details. We rate it Half True.	None	Mark Udall	None	None	None	2014-04-25T15:11:26	2014-04-21	['Colorado']
pomt-03421	Says Delaware County has more waterfront property than any other county in the state of Ohio	true	/ohio/statements/2013/jun/27/kris-jordan/ohio-sen-kris-jordan-says-delaware-county-lays-cla/	Ohio’s northern shore along Lake Erie provides a coastal connection to the Great Lakes, a series of inland seas that collectively hold the greatest supply of freshwater in the world. So it got PolitiFact Ohio’s curiosity going when we heard a claim that state Sen. Kris Jordan, a Republican from Delaware County, made during budget debates in the Ohio Senate. "Delaware County actually has more lakefront property and waterfront property than any other county in the state of Ohio," Jordan said. PolitiFact Ohio decided to see if Jordan’s claim held water. After all, Ohio’s north shore stretches hundreds of miles through eight different counties. Delaware County, meanwhile, is landlocked in the center of the state. First, let’s put Jordan’s remark in context. The senator made his claim while speaking in support of some provisions in the budget bill that targeted the city of Columbus. Columbus maintains a buffer strip around two reservoirs that extend into Delaware County, and Jordan’s district, and supply water to the city. Adjacent property owners have, in the past, clashed with the city over use of the buffer strips. Some, for example, have been cited for mowing grasses that the city says help with filtration of runoff water that enters the reservoir. The budget bill included restrictions to bar the city from penalizing property owners for doing what Jordan described as "basic maintenance of their property." He urged they be left in the legislation. Those reservoirs are part of the reason Delaware County has the most shoreline, Jordan said. PolitiFact Ohio checked with the Ohio Department of Natural Resources to see what data it could provide. It has a website link with information about the Lake Erie shoreline that includes mileage for each of eight counties -- Ashtabula, Cuyahoga, Erie, Lake, Lorain, Lucas, Ottawa and Sandusky. Ottawa County, which includes most of the Lake Erie islands, has the most lakefront property among those eight, with total shoreline of 94 miles. Next was Erie County with 68 miles. Sandusky County had the least among the eight with just 13 miles of lakeshore. But Ottawa’s shoreline wasn’t nearly the greatest in Ohio. ODNR experts from the Division of Coastal Management and Division of Soil and Water Resources used data from geographic information systems to calculate shorelines for Ohio’s other counties, coming up with estimates that took into account waterfront along inland lakes and waterways. Ottawa cracked the top five at No. 4. The others in the top five are inland counties that are home to large lakes or reservoirs. And Delaware was indeed No. 1. It has about 140 miles of shoreline, according to ODNR. Delaware County is home to O’Shaughnessy and Hoover reservoirs, two large man-made lakes that are a key part of Columbus’ water supply. Alum Creek Lake and Delaware Lake, two other man-made bodies of water, also are in Delaware County. Each is home to a state park. Jordan’s claim was that Delaware County had more waterfront property than any other in the state of Ohio. ODNR’s experts, using computer data to prepare the estimates, would agree. On the Truth-O-Meter, his claim rates True.	None	Kris Jordan	None	None	None	2013-06-27T06:00:00	2013-06-06	['Ohio']
pomt-14720	"Here in Wisconsin, we've put in previous budgets more money into mental health services than any governor has in the last 25 years."	true	/wisconsin/statements/2015/dec/23/scott-walker/scott-walker-says-he-put-more-funds-mental-health-/	On Dec. 3, 2015, Gov. Scott Walker was asked by a Wisconsin reporter for his reaction to the gunslaying of 14 people in San Bernardino, Calif. the previous day. That was before authorities had determined that the husband-and-wife shooters had discussed jihad and martyrdom. Walker responded by talking about mental illness. "We don’t know enough about this instance. But for others like that, what we’ve found is one of the common denominators in many of these cases are people who’ve slipped through the cracks when it comes to chronic mental illness," the governor said. "That’s why I’m proud that here in Wisconsin, we’ve put in previous budgets more money into mental health services than any governor has in the last 25 years." Two longtime mental health advocates told us that Walker’s funding boost was exceptional. "We were hard pressed to think of anything quite as significant," said Shel Gross, senior policy associate at Mental Health America of Wisconsin. So let’s see whether Walker put into the state budget more money for mental health than any governor in the last quarter-century. Walker’s evidence Walker announced in February 2013, in the wake of mass shootings in Newtown, Conn., and at a Sikh temple and a spa in suburban Milwaukee, that he would raise spending on mental health services by $29 million in his 2013-’15 state budget. The six initiatives included $12.6 million to open two units at the Mendota Mental Health Institute, a state-run psychiatric hospital in Madison for patients who have been committed, and $10.2 million for expanding community-based care programs for people with severe mental illness. When Walker made his formal budget presentation later that month, he said only half of all Wisconsin adults with "serious psychological distress received mental health treatment or medication" -- a claim we rated Mostly True. We noted that the Wisconsin chapter of National Alliance on Mental Illness had praised the spending boost, but criticized Walker for rejecting a proposal under President Barack Obama’s Affordable Care Act to expand Medicaid, saying his decision "reflects a shallow understanding" of "crucial means to affordable mental health care for Wisconsin residents." Mental health benefits in private-sector insurance plans are generally less comprehensive than those provided by Medicaid. But that is separate from the amount of state funds Walker put into the state budget. To back the governor’s claim, a spokeswoman provided us a February 2013 email from Walker’s Department of Administration that said there had not been a mental health funding boost in "general purpose revenue" since the creation of what was known as the "community aids" program in the mid-1970s. Walker’s office also had his Department of Health Services provide us more detail in restating that his investment was the largest since the ‘70s. Separately, the nonpartisan Legislative Fiscal Bureau confirmed to us that the $29 million increase in state funding budgeted for mental health services in the 2013-15 state budget was the largest increase in at least 25 years, and that no other increases during that time were nearly as much. A final note: Charlie Morgan, a program supervisor for the fiscal bureau, told us that the total amount the state budgets for mental health services "is not easily answered." That’s because funding for those services is provided through many programs, including: inpatient services provided by the state's mental health hospitals, community-based mental health services that are budgeted as distinct programs; and funding the state provides to counties, including for programs that provide mental health as well as substance abuse services. But it’s clear the additional $29 million added by Walker is the largest such increase in at least 25 years, he said.

pomt-02197	"Oklahoma’s Republican Gov. Mary Fallin signed a new law which makes you pay a special fee. It will essentially fine people for the crime of using solar power."	mostly false	/punditfact/statements/2014/apr/24/rachel-maddow/rachel-maddow-unleashes-oklahomas-sun-tax-misses-c/	Rachel Maddow sharply criticized Oklahoma Gov. Mary Fallin on her MSNBC show Monday for imposing a "sun tax" on residents who install solar panels or wind turbines to conserve energy and save on their electric bill. But Maddow’s searing attack is misleading, says even a solar energy trade association. Maddow topped her April 21 broadcast with the story of SB 1456, connecting the "sun tax" law to conservative-driven efforts in other states to dial back state-approved benefits for utility customers who use alternative energy sources like small wind turbines and solar panels. (In Oklahoma, wind turbines are more prevalent than solar panels, for the record.) "Tonight Oklahoma’s Republican Gov. Mary Fallin signed a new law which makes you pay a special fee," she said. "It will essentially fine people for the crime of using solar power. If you want to use the sun for electricity instead of your local coal fire power plant, the redder-than-red state Oklahoma government has figured out a way to make you pay for that crime." But the law mandates no special fee or fine as Maddow says. What SB 1456 does is crack open the door for Oklahoma’s utility companies to apply to charge future "distributed generation" customers (the ones who invest in solar and wind energy devices on their properties) a tariff, surcharge, fee, or whatever you want to call it. But that fee or "fine" could only come after extensive court-like hearings before a state regulator, the Oklahoma Corporation Commission. And there are questions if that will happen. In signing the proposal into law, Fallin released an executive order that repeatedly stressed the bill does not mean a fee or surcharge is the only way to deal with the concern of utility companies. Fallin "specifically said the bill does not mandate an increase for solar customers," said Bryan Miller, president of the pro-solar group Alliance for Solar Choice. While Miller opposes a fee or surcharge should one come, he said Maddow’s segment missed the mark. Miller called Fallin’s executive order "a tremendously positive step for the future of Oklahoma in promoting distributed generation." "Even without the executive order, it was a very misleading story," Miller said. MSNBC spokeswoman Lauren Skowronski said the show stood by its reporting. "The order declares the governor’s recognition that renewable energy is important, but it does not, in any codified way, meaningfully change what the new law does," Skowronski said. "The law was opposed by advocates of solar power for the very reason that it is designed to impede the expansion of solar usage among Oklahoma consumers, and the governor’s executive order does not change that." We’ll unpack all of this a little more for you. Oklahoma’s explanation SB 1456 moved quickly through the Republican-led Oklahoma Legislature. State Rep. Mike Turner, a Republican whom Maddow mocked during her April 21 show for proposing an all-out ban on marriage, was the primary House sponsor of the bill. He introduced it on the Oklahoma House floor this way: "Members, this bill effectively allows our senior citizens as well as our lower-income individuals in this state to no longer bear the cost of the way that we do accounting." That’s not a very detailed or transparent explanation for what SB 1456 is really about, but no one asked questions before passing it on an 83-5 vote. (One lawmaker asked Turner a question privately as members voted, and Turner could be heard saying, "This doesn’t raise, it’s not what people think.") Turner told PunditFact he was not acting at the behest of utilities, the conservative American Legislative Exchange Council or Koch brothers by supporting the Senate bill, as Maddow suggested during her broadcast. Still, a pro-solar Republican group went against him for sponsoring the bill in a video ad suggesting he turned on conservative principles by "taxing solar." "It’s not a tax," Turner told PunditFact of his bill. "You have to be a willing customer." A self-described opponent of subsidies, Turner says Oklahoma’s 350 or so customers who use wind, solar or other alternative energy devices are being subsidized by other utility customers under current law. Here’s his argument. Most people who have wind- and solar- energy devices are not completely off the grid. They access the grid on cloudy or low-wind days, utilities say. Like most states, Oklahoma has a net-metering law that allows ratepayers who install solar panels and microturbines to sell excess energy they generate for use by their nearest neighbor. The utility, compelled by federal law, must buy back this energy at the retail rate, so the "seller" is charged only for their net energy use (what they sell minus what they use). Before Turner’s bill became law, utility companies could not charge solar customers for extracting the excess energy with their infrastructure. Turner says solar panel customers fail to compensate the utility companies for harnessing the extra power. As a result, that additional cost is picked up by other customers. Spokespeople for the state’s two largest utility companies, Oklahoma Gas and Electric and the Public Service Company of Oklahoma, say the current system is giving an unfair break on grid "maintenance costs" to customers who use solar or wind power. "What we credit them for energy they generate greatly exceeds the value of that energy," said Stan Whitehouse, Public Service Company of Oklahoma spokesman. "Distributed generation is no longer in its infancy, and as potential for growth grows, the subsidization will only increase." This bill could fix that inequity, the utilities say, by letting the state utility regulator "set up a new rate for distributed generation that would be very clear about here is what you owe to cover the cost of the grid maintenance and here is the amount of electricity you use," said Oklahoma Gas and Electric spokeswoman Kathleen O’Shea. Practically speaking, the fee would eat into the credits solar and wind customers accumulate from selling excess energy back to the electrical grid -- a concept that pro-solar groups, including Miller’s Alliance for Solar Choice, oppose. To Maddow, that’s a tax. To Turner, it’s eliminating a subsidy. The law, which goes into effect Nov. 1, says utilities would have to get new charges approved by the end of 2015. What SB 1456 does Specifically, the law modifies a 1970s-era law that prevented utilities from increasing rates or imposing a surcharge because a consumer installed a solar energy device. The change would not affect existing customers. The law says a higher fixed charge for new customers with energy-saving equipment is "a means to avoid subsidization." Emphasis on "a," Miller said. "It says you can have a fee, but it doesn’t say you have to have a fee," he said. The practical effect of the bill for future solar and wind customers is unclear until the state’s utility regulator starts the process of reviewing a fee request from a utility. Arguments for and against would be reviewed by an administrative law judge, who would make a recommendation to Oklahoma’s three-person Corporation Commission. The commission could approve the fee or surcharge, reject it, or order additional review. To approve the fee -- and this is important -- the Corporation Commission would need to conclude solar and wind customers are being subsidized by other energy users. Alternative energy users would still save money by selling their excess energy, they’d just save less. The law does not just affect solar users. Mike Bergey, Bergey WindPower Co. president and CEO, sent a letter to Fallin expressing profound disappointment for signing the law because uncertainty about a fee will hurt microturbine sales by dissuading customers interested in investing in a nascent industry. Oklahoma does not offer state incentives for residents who install small-scale solar and wind devices, so "it’s a rare customer" who is willing to take the investment leap. A federal tax credit defrays some of the cost of a small $65,000 wind system, but extra utility fees would extend the payback period that customers usually recoup from reduced bills. "Certainly the utilities will make a strong case for additional charges," said Bergey, who said he will fight a proposed utility tariff. "What the industry is concerned about is they’ll play up the cost ... and ignore the benefits." Some observers look to what happened in Arizona as a sign of what could come next. There, a utility proposal backed by conservative groups to charge solar customers $50-$100 per month was whittled down to about $5 by the commission. And that executive order? Fallin’s executive order insisted the bill "does not mandate tariffs or other increases for distributed generation customers." Fallin told state agencies to implement the bill in accordance with her energy plan, "which promotes wind and solar power as important forms of clean energy," and for the commission to "consider the use of all available alternatives, including other rate reforms such as increased use of time-of-use rates, minimum bills, and demand charges." The executive order isn’t binding, but it provides guidance to the Corporation Commission. Commissioners are elected statewide while vacancies are filled by the governor. "This will be given all the attention that any changes in rates are given," said Mike Skinner, the Corporation Commission spokesman. Still, Fallin’s order is music to solar advocates’ ears. "Even without the executive order, the bill is just ambiguous and does not mandate any charge," Miller said. "But the executive order lends a lot of clarity to that." We checked in with TUSK, or Tell Utilities Solar won’t be Killed, a pro-solar group led by Republicans Barry Goldwater Jr., a former California congressman, and Tom Morrissey, former chairman of the Arizona Republican Party. TUSK consultant Jason Rose called Fallin’s executive order indicative of "Republican adults" who support customers’ rights to use solar to defray electric costs. "Do I think (Maddow’s) assessment of the legislative effort was accurate? Yes, I do," Rose said. "Was she unaware, or were her producers unaware, of the executive order that neutered the legislation? Yes." Our ruling Maddow said, "Oklahoma's Republican Gov. Mary Fallin signed a new law which makes you pay a special fee. It will essentially fine people for the crime of using solar power." The law does not make you pay a special fee for using solar power, as Maddow said. What it does do is open the door to a potential fee -- if utility companies can prove that solar and wind customers are being subsidized by other energy consumers. We’re a ways from knowing whether the utilities can make their case and what fee might be assessed. The law does not affect the ability of Oklahoma solar and wind customers to sell excess energy they produce to lower their monthly bill, and even advocates of solar energy say Maddow’s segment missed news in Fallin’s executive order, which stressed "this bill does not mandate tariffs or other increases" for people who generate alternative energy. Maddow’s statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression. We rate it Mostly False.

pomt-01263	"We've created more jobs in the United States than every other advanced economy combined since I came into office."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2014/nov/09/barack-obama/obama-2009-us-has-created-more-jobs-every-other-ad/	America’s labor market is creeping back to pre-recession levels, and President Barack Obama says its growth has surpassed that of every other advanced country combined. Obama appeared on CBS’ Face the Nation Nov. 9 in an interview with host Bob Schieffer. When asked about the Democrats’ midterm election losses, Obama said the big takeaway is that Americans don’t think Washington is working -- even though the economy is getting better. "The economy has improved significantly. There's no doubt about it," Obama said. "We had a jobs report for October that showed that once again over 200,000 jobs created. We've now created more than 10 million. The unemployment rate's come down faster than we could have anticipated. Just to give you some perspective, Bob, we've created more jobs in the United States than every other advanced economy combined since I came into office." By many metrics, the United States has bounced back from the recession better than other advanced countries. (For the record, the 10-million-jobs-added figure Obama cited is just private-sector jobs and excludes much of Obama's first year in office.) But we wondered if, in the past six years, U.S. job growth has surpassed other leading economies by such a wide margin. By the numbers We turned to the International Monetary Fund for economic data. The IMF classifies 36 countries as "advanced economies" -- and seven of those countries as "major advanced economies." We looked at total average annual employment from 2009 (Obama’s first year in office) through 2014. Using an average helps isolate against monthly fluctuations and is a better way to compare jobs pictures across countries. Country or group 2009 employment 2014 employment, est Absolute growth Percent growth United States 139.9 million 145.9 million 5.98 million 4.27 percent IMF: 36 advanced economies (except U.S.) 326.5 million 332.8 million 6.28 million 1.92 percent IMF: G7 major advanced economies (except U.S.) 196.1 million 200.8 million 4.72 million 2.41 percent (For all the data, check out this Google spreadsheet.) So, according to the IMF, the number of people employed in the United States has grown by roughly 6 million people. (The Bureau of Labor Statistics puts the figure at about 5.7 million.) Neither figure is literally more than all of the other 35 countries labeled an advanced economy, as Obama said, but it’s fairly close. But it is clearly more than the other G7 countries -- Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan and the United Kingdom -- combined. There is one wrinkle with the IMF's list. The IMF’s advanced economies list includes Taiwan and Hong Kong, which are not recognized as independent countries but added more than 1 million jobs. If you chose to exclude them from the IMF's list, Obama would be correct, Harvard economist Jeffrey Frankel told us. (Though Obama said "advanced economy" not country.) Some caveats So you could make a case that Obama is right. But you can also say that he's off. There are some other obvious caveats to point out. For starters, the United States is the most populous of these countries -- more than twice the population of Japan, which is the next most populous advanced economy (China, Russia and India do not make this list). So it’s logical that there will, in general, be higher job gains in absolute numbers compared to smaller nations. Looking at the percentage growth rate instead of the absolute number of jobs helps to account for the population differences among these advanced nations. And by that measurement, the United States’ growth rate is lower than quite a few nations on this list, including: Australia, Austria, Canada, Estonia, Germany, Iceland, Israel, South Korea, Luxembourg, Malta, New Zealand, Norway, Singapore, Sweden, Switzerland and the United Kingdom. The country with the highest job growth rate was Singapore, with a rate of more than 18 percent. Also, the number of jobs in the United States has just this year returned to a point near pre-recession levels. The United States hemorrhaged jobs in the last months of 2008 and the first few months of 2009. This means that Obama hasn’t had non-stop job growth throughout his presidency. There have been months of overall job loss, particularly in that first year, amidst the recession. Tara Sinclair, a George Washington University economist, noted that this job growth is likely not attributable to any of Obama’s actions, even though the economic recovery happened to start soon after he took office. "Overall these sorts of comparisons mean little because employment outcomes have more to do with the economic environments more generally rather than specifically the president's policies," Sinclair said. Our ruling Obama said, "We've created more jobs in the United States than every other advanced economy combined since I came into office." Using a straight definition of advanced economic nations from the International Monetary Fund, Obama is slightly off. The United States has added less jobs than a group of 35 other advanced economic nations combined, not more. However, you can make the argument that two countries on the list -- Hong Kong and Taiwan -- should be excluded. What’s equally and perhaps more noteworthy is that when you look at the rate of job growth, which accounts for population differences, the United States trails other advanced nations. Overall, we rate Obama's claim Half True.	None	Barack Obama	None	None	None	2014-11-09T18:00:08	2014-11-09	['United_States']
pomt-14309	Says Ted Cruz distributed the ad showing a nude Melania Trump on a rug.	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/mar/31/donald-trump/donald-trump-has-no-evidence-ted-cruz-was-responsi/	Call it the war over the wives. An ad suggesting that Donald Trump's wife, Melania, might not be modest enough to be first lady started a series of nasty exchanges between Trump and Sen. Ted Cruz that have been the talk of the campaign for more than a week. CNN's Anderson Cooper grilled Trump about the ad during a March 29 interview in Wisconsin, questioning Trump about his accusation, made in a March 22 tweet, that Cruz was responsible for the picture. "I did not start this," Trump told Cooper seven days after the tweet. "He sent out a picture and he knew very well it was a picture ... " "He didn't send out a picture," Cooper interrupted. "It was an anti-Trump super PAC." When Cooper asked Trump if he had any proof that Cruz was behind the ad, Trump said, "No. Everybody knows he sent it out. He knew the people in the super PAC. He knew. I would be willing to bet he wrote the phrase," a reference to the words that accompanied the nude photograph of Mrs. Trump, a model, posed on a rug. "Meet Melania Trump, your next first lady," the ad said. "Or, you could support Ted Cruz on Tuesday," a reference to the March 22 Utah primary. "I didn't send the photo to everybody in the state of Utah. He did," said Trump. "It was his people, who were his friends." For this fact-check, we'll look at whether Trump is correct that Cruz distributed this Facebook ad containing a nude photograph of Trump's wife. Federal law says political ads must clearly identify their source, and this one lists the source as a political action committee called Make America Awesome. Such groups are called super PACs because they can spend limitless amounts of money advocating for or against a candidate or a point of view. Super PACs have one major restriction: They can't coordinate their efforts with a candidate's official campaign, which is restricted in its spending. If Cruz did arrange for the ad under the auspices of the super PAC, it would be a serious violation of federal law. The super PAC says . . . "The Cruz campaign had nothing to do with this ad whatsoever. We didn’t get the image or the idea for the ad from them," said Republican strategist Liz Mair, who is behind the super PAC. Make America Awesome, based in Virginia, was founded in December and reports $20,752 in contributions through February, with most of the money that it spent going to small purchases of air time in nine states, according to the Federal Election Commission website. "I would guess that including money that has come in since our last filing, we have raised about $35,000," said Mair. There's also no evidence that the PAC is a front for the Cruz campaign. When we checked the PAC's YouTube page, we found four commercials, only two of which are the standard length for broadcast. The Jan. 20 "Buyer Beware" commercial, obviously made on a shoestring budget, includes a light-hearted rundown of nine Republican presidential candidates as breakfast cereals. They include Jeb Bush ("Good source of experience and wonkiness. The brand you know."), Ben Carson ("With extra nice guy doctorness."), Chris Christie ("100% RDA of telling it like it is.") and Ted Cruz ("Two Scoops of Conservatism!"). In the ad, the shopper buys the Trump cereal ("Guaranteed success and a free 'Screw the Liberal Establishment!' voucher inside") and ends up regretting the purchase. Mormon women targeted "The only ads we've run in favor of any candidate are the three Facebook ads we ran targeting Mormons in Utah and Arizona, of which the Melania one was one, and the one with the least money put behind it (about $300, maybe even less than that, honestly)," Mair wrote in an email. The Melania ad, she wrote, "was targeted only to Mormon women of (if I recall correctly) ages 45-65 living in Utah and Arizona who self-identified as moderate, conservative or very conservative. "The shot we used was chosen because of the presence of handcuffs, which was particularly bothersome to the target audience," Mair said. "However, there are definitely racier shots of her out there that would no doubt be considered more scandalous by a lot of voters across the entire political spectrum — too racy for us to use in Facebook ads, candidly." Although the ads urge voters to support the Texas senator, he was only one of two viable alternatives to Trump currently on the ballot in those states. Picture purchased? In a March 27 interview with ABC News, Trump claimed Cruz or his campaign bought the rights to the Melania photo and gave it to the super PAC. There's no evidence that Cruz, the campaign or Mair's group purchased rights to the photo, taken when she was Trump's girlfriend. "The image was, at the time we concepted out and then created the ad, already republished all over the Internet at numerous sites," Mair told us in an email. The photographer who took the image for the 2000 photo spread in British GQ, Antoine Verglas, told our friends at FactCheck.org that nobody contacted him to buy rights to the picture. The magazine reprinted that photo, along with other pictures from the shoot, online March 4 under the headline, "The Future First Lady? Sexy Melania Trump's Nude Photo Shoot." "As for Cruz himself," Mair said, "I think I've met him at gatherings attended by many people maybe once or twice in my life (and it will have been some time ago), and I have never spoken to him privately." We contacted the Trump campaign but didn't get a response. Our ruling Trump said Cruz was responsible for the racy ad questioning whether people wanted Melania Trump to be first lady. One of the tenets of PolitiFact is that the person making the claim is responsible for substantiating it. Trump said on CNN that he has no real proof. And all the evidence we found points to the ad being the work of a political action committee whose goal has been to block Trump's nomination. There’s no proof of Cruz working with that committee, which would be illegal. We rate Trump's claim as False. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/0c9f8bb8-bbff-4c6b-8ec6-c489e2fbab41	None	Donald Trump	None	None	None	2016-03-31T17:29:23	2016-03-29	['Ted_Cruz']
pomt-08686	"When these same Republicans –- including Mr. Boehner –- were in charge, the number of earmarks and pet projects went up, not down."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/sep/09/barack-obama/obama-says-republican-congresses-used-lots-earmark/	President Barack Obama has been making a case against Republicans in Congress, hoping to help Democrats in the midterm elections. One of his points is that the Democrats' policies on the economy are better than the Republicans. "Along with tax cuts for the wealthy, the other party's main economic proposal is that they'll stop government spending," Obama said. "Of course, they are right to be concerned about the long-term deficit -– if we don't get a handle on it soon, it can endanger our future. And at a time when folks are tightening their belts at home, I understand why a lot of Americans feel it's time for government to show some discipline too. "But let's look at the facts. When these same Republicans –- including Mr. Boehner –- were in charge, the number of earmarks and pet projects went up, not down." "Mr. Boehner" is Rep. John Boehner of Ohio, the Republican leader. Obama mentioned him by name about half a dozen times in his speech on Sept. 8, 2010. We knew earmarks had gone up during the Bush administration, but we weren't sure how they tracked Republican majorities in Congress. Republicans held control of Congress for most of the period from 1995 to 2006. (In 2001, Democrats briefly re-took control of the Senate but lost it again in 2003.) So we decided to check it out. Generally speaking, earmarks are spending that individual members of Congress request for particular programs or projects. Earmarks usually don't go through the normal vetting processes to make sure the projects are worthy. They're often considered a perk for members of Congress to fund their favorite projects. We turned to Taxpayers for Common Sense, an nonpartisan advocacy group that fights wasteful spending in Congress. The group opposes earmarks because they circumvent normal budget processes, crowd out funding for merit-based projects and invite corruption. We asked vice president Steve Ellis whether earmarks went up, not down, under the Republican-controlled Congresses. "Totally true," Ellis said. "Certainly under the Republicans there was a big rise in earmarks." The high mark was fiscal 2005, the last fiscal year before Democrats won control, when Congress passed bills with approximately 16,000 earmarks, Ellis said. We were able to find other sources that agreed with Ellis. The nonpartisan Congressional Research Service documented increasing earmarks in different parts of appropriations bills in its report Earmarks in Appropriation Acts: FY1994, FY1996, FY1998, FY2000, FY2002, FY2004, FY2005. The conservative Heritage Foundation included a striking chart on earmarks in its Federal Spending by the Numbers 2010 report. It reported a slightly different number of earmarks, at approximately 14,000 earmarks in 2005. But that was the largest number of earmarks between 1991 and 2010, and a significant increase from 1994, when there were fewer than 2,000. We asked Ellis why earmarks increased so steadily during the years Republicans controlled Congress, and he said there were several factors at work. Prior to Republican control, Ellis said, Democrats reserved earmarks for committee chairman and other powerful leaders. Under Republicans, more rank-and-file members of Congress were allowed to insert earmarks into bills. The Republicans allowed Democrats to insert earmarks as well, so Democrats were not so quick to criticize what the Republicans were doing, he said. Finally, special interests got better at lobbying members of Congress, using new technology like cell phones and Blackberrys to communicate with members as legislation was being put together. That new technology, though, also allowed citizens to document and share information about earmarks, which led to widespread outrage that resulted in earmark reforms when Democrats won control of Congress in 2006, bringing more transparency to the process. "The more people could look at earmarks and analyze them, the more they could see what Congress was doing and criticize it," Ellis said. But transparency on earmarks doesn't mean earmarks have gone away. During the campaign, Obama promised to reduce earmarks to $7.8 billion a year, what they were at in 1994. Here at PolitiFact, we rated that Promise Broken. The last budget for fiscal year 2010 included 9,499 earmarks worth $15.9 billion, according to an analysis from Taxpayers for Common Sense. We should note that earlier this year, House Republicans voluntarily agreed to a one-year moratorium on earmarks. House Democrats agreed to a ban on earmarks that benefit for-profit companies but not on earmarks for local government projects or nonprofit projects. Senators of both parties continue to earmark. And finally, it's important to note that other Republicans may like earmarking, but Boehner is not among them. In 2009, we fact-checked his statement, "I don't do earmarks. I've never done one," and rated it True. He hasn't taken an earmark since he was elected to Congress in 1990. Boehner's staff also pointed out that Boehner was not in leadership for all of the years Republicans controlled Congress; he did not have a leadership position between 1998 and 2006. And in 2006, the year Boehner was majority leader, earmarks declined from the 2005 high, they said. Getting back to our rating, Obama said that "When these same Republicans – including Mr. Boehner – were in charge, the number of earmarks and pet projects went up, not down." Earmarks increased dramatically between 1995 and 2006, so we find Obama's statement that earmarks went up, not down, to be correct. But he also singles out Boehner by name, when Boehner didn't take any earmarks and wasn't in leadership for most of those years. So we rate Obama's statement Mostly True.

pomt-01085	Milwaukee "incarcerates 1.2% of white men" and has "incarcerated over 50% of black men in their 30s."	half-true	/wisconsin/statements/2015/jan/15/facebook-posts/huge-disparity-jailing-black-and-white-males-milwa/	For years, Milwaukee has made national headlines for being one of the most segregated urban areas in America. In 2011, we rated Mostly True a Rev. Jesse Jackson claim that Milwaukee is the nation’s most-segregated city. We found that the white-black segregation is worst in metropolitan Milwaukee, if not in the city itself. Now there’s an Internet meme that has been liked, shared or commented on more than 18,000 times on Facebook. It makes a two-part claim about Milwaukee and putting whites and blacks behind bars. Milwaukee, the posting says, "incarcerates 1.2 percent of white men" and has "incarcerated over 50 percent of black men in their 30s." "Pass this along for the millions of people who say racism is not an issue. Cure them of their ignorance," the group said in posting the meme. The black-white gap between the two percentages caught our attention. But so did the fact that the percentages measure two different things. Behind the meme The meme was posted Dec. 31, 2014 on Facebook by US Uncut, a loose network of local groups that coordinates nationally through the Internet. The Daily Beast has described the group as the "tea party for the left." Its Facebook page has more than 932,000 likes. The group, formed in 2011, says it has "mobilized thousands of people against corporate tax dodging and austerity." But it has also addressed racial issues. We connected via phone and email with Mark Provost of Manchester, N.H., who describes himself as a meme maker for US Uncut. He said the two statistics cited in the meme came from a study published in 2013 by the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee. (That study garnered news coverage from the BBC, among others.) First part of the claim The first part of US Uncut's claim is 1.2 percent of white men in Milwaukee are incarcerated. But what the UWM study says is 1.2 percent of white men in Wisconsin were incarcerated in state prison or local jails -- there is no such figure in the study for Milwaukee. That was as of April 2010, when U.S. Census Bureau conducted its most recent decennial count of Wisconsin residents. Provost acknowledged that that part of the study deals only with Wisconsin, and that he doesn't have a figure for Milwaukee. It’s worth noting the study did find a much higher rate of African-American men in Wisconsin -- 12.8 percent -- were incarcerated at the time. That was the highest such rate in the nation, according to the study (Oklahoma was second at 9.7 percent). Second part The second part of the claim is Milwaukee has incarcerated more than 50 percent of black men in their 30s. An important point here is that the first part of the claim was about incarceration at one point in time. This part of the claim covers more than two decades. The UWM study estimated based on state correctional records that over half of black men in their 30s in Milwaukee County (rather than the city) were incarcerated in state correctional facilities between 1990 and January 2012. The difference between the city and the county doesn’t appear significant. Lois Quinn, one of the researchers who did the study, told us the study doesn’t have city of Milwaukee figures on this statistic. "But given the concentrations of African-Americans residing in the city and the maps of those incarcerated, I believe that it would be accurate to expect" that over half of black men in their 30s in the city have been or were incarcerated during that period, she said. The study did not, however, attempt to make the same incarceration estimate for white men in their 30s. In any case, placing the two side by side amounts to mixing apples and oranges. The first figure is for people incarcerated at a given moment in time. The second is for people who have ever been incarcerated, which clearly skews the comparison. Our rating The left-wing activist group US Uncut says in a Facebook meme that Milwaukee "incarcerates 1.2 percent of white men" and has "incarcerated over 50 percent of black men in their 30s." But the way the claim is structured overstates the disparity, based on the university study it relies on. On the first part of the claim (which should refer to Wisconsin, rather than Milwaukee), 1.2 percent of white men were incarcerated as of the latest census, versus 12.8 percent of black men. That is, at a given point in time. The second part of the claim essentially quotes the study accurately -- more than 50 percent of black men in their 30s in Milwaukee County were or had been incarcerated. But there is no corresponding figure for white men. For a statement that is partially accurate but leaves out important details, our rating is Half True.

pomt-10102	Says Obama wants to redesign the American flag "to better offer our enemies hope and love."	pants on fire!	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/oct/25/chain-email/the-coke-theme-song-and-more-ridiculous-allegation/	We've seen a lot of groundless and ridiculous chain e-mails during the 2008 campaign. There was the one that fabricated Bible verses to suggest Barack Obama fit the profile for the Antichrist; there was another that falsified a list of books that Sarah Palin supposedly sought to ban; and there was our all-time favorite, which falsely claimed Obama wants the national anthem to be I'd Like to Teach the World to Sing . We always liked that song when it was the Coca-Cola theme, and the chain e-mail provided a fun excuse in April to watch the commercial on YouTube. So it was a treat when several readers sent us a new e-mail that includes the national anthem quote along with some other equally ridiculous ones. (You can read the full e-mail here .) The e-mail has been widely circulated and posted on dozens of blogs because it has a few elements that make it look authentic. It says that Obama made the remarks "on Sunday's Televised 'Meet the Press,' " and the account appears to be written by Dale Lindsborg of the Washington Post . And unless you are a keen student of cola advertising, you might miss the satirical suggestion about the song. So let's put the Coke song on the turntable as we examine the new e-mail. It begins, like so many chain e-mails attacking Obama, with a subject line that invokes patriotism: "Meet the Press - read this if you're an American." It says the account is "a narrative taken from Sunday Morning's televised 'Meet the Press', and the author is employed by none other than the Washington Post." It says that on the Sept. 7 show, Obama was asked by "General Bill Ginn' USAF (ret.)" why he doesn't follow protocol when the national anthem is played. (That question is based on a photograph of Obama standing with his hands folded at his waist while Sen. Hillary Clinton and others have their hands over their hearts. It has been misinterpreted in many chain e-mails as an indication that Obama refuses to say the Pledge of Allegiance, which we addressed with this article .) During the Meet the Press appearance, Obama is said to have replied, "As I've said about the flag pin, I don't want to be perceived as taking sides. . . .There are a lot of people in the world to whom the American flag is a symbol of oppression. And the anthem itself conveys a war-like message. You know, the bombs bursting in air and all. It should be swapped for something less parochial and less bellicose. I like the song 'I'd Like To Teach the World To Sing.' If that were our anthem, then I might salute it." Obama, it says, continued: "We should consider to reinvent our National Anthem as well as to redesign our Flag to better offer our enemies hope and love. It's my intention, if elected, to disarm America to the level of acceptance to our Middle East Brethren. If we as a Nation of warring people, should conduct ourselves as the nations of Islam, whereas peace prevails. Perhaps a state or period of mutual concord between our governments. When I become President, I will seek a pact or agreement to end hostilities between those who have been at war or in a state of enmity, and a freedom from disquieting oppressive thoughts. We as a Nation have placed upon the nations of Islam an unfair injustice." It then abruptly shifts gears to his comments about his wife Michelle: "My wife disrespects the Flag for many personal reasons. Together she and I have attended several flag burning ceremonies in the past, many years ago. She has her views and I have mine. Of course now, I have found myself about to become the President of the United States and I have put aside my hatred. I will use my power to bring CHANGE to this Nation, and offer the people a new path of hope. My wife and I look forward to becoming our Country's First Family. Indeed, CHANGE is about to overwhelm the United States of America." It is signed "Dale Lindsborg, Washington Post." It would be difficult to tally the many, many ways this e-mail is false, but we'll start with the obvious ones. First, Obama was not on Meet the Press on Sept. 7. The guests were Joe Biden and New York Times columnist Thomas Friedman. Nor was Gen. Bill Ginn on the show. Ginn is indeed a retired Air Force general and not a fan of Obama. In an interview with PolitiFact, Ginn cited Obama's association with Weather Underground co-founder William Ayers, the group ACORN and his former pastor, the Rev. Jeremiah Wright, as just a few examples why he does not want Obama to be president. But Ginn said the Meet the Press account was fabricated and that he had never spoken to Obama. Ginn said his name might have gotten attached to the e-mail because of a message he sent to a friend expressing concern about Obama not putting his hand over his heart during the national anthem. Neither is Dale Lindsborg a reporter at the Washington Post . Anne Kornblut, a real political reporter from the Post , said in an online chat that she checked the paper's directory and couldn't find anyone by that name. And, Obama's quote is fabricated. It seems to be a mashup from at least two sources. The anthem part comes from a satirical column published on the Web in October 2007 by Arizona writer John Semmens that produced the original bogus e-mail that we checked last spring. We couldn't determine the origin of the part about redesigning the American flag "to better offer our enemies hope and love," but a search of the Project Vote Smart database of Obama's speeches indicates he has not uttered the phrase. He also has not made the remark about his wife disrespecting the flag, according to the Vote Smart database. This chain e-mail, like most that we've checked, is false. In fact, it's so ridiculously, maliciously false, that it sets the Truth-O-Meter ablaze. Pants on Fire.	None	Chain email	None	None	None	2008-10-25T00:00:00	2008-10-25	['United_States']
pomt-04605	"Under Obama, families have lost over $4,000 a year in income."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/sep/19/mitt-romney/romney-ad-faults-obama-falling-incomes/	Mitt Romney says President Barack Obama is failing American families with policies that have led to less income and more debt. Less family income, that is, and more national debt. "Under Obama, families have lost over $4,000 a year in income, says the narrator of a new campaign ad. "And the national debt is now $16 trillion and growing." The ad then shows clips of Romney promising to reverse those trends. Here, we’ll check what has happened to household incomes under Obama. Tracking median incomes The Romney ad cites an opinion piece in the Wall Street Journal, which argues that Obama’s presidency has "done enormous harm to middle-class households." The editorial, in turn, points to data from a private group, Sentier Research. Last year, Sentier initiated a new statistic based on U.S. Census Bureau data -- a "household income index" that tracks upticks and downticks in median income and reports it monthly. What did Sentier find? In January 2009, the month Obama took office, median household income was $54,893. In June 2012, it was $50,881, a drop of almost $4,000. (We used inflation-adjusted figures from a spreadsheet provided to us by Sentier. The Wall Street Journal cited slightly different figures, but the difference is just a few dollars.) To create Sentier’s index, principals Gordon Green and John Coder take data from the Bureau’s monthly household survey, the one used to determine the national unemployment rate. This census survey reaches approximately 50,000 households and 130,000 household members each month, asking a variety of questions, including the sum of income earned by household members during the previous 12 months. That’s very similar to how the census produces its report called the Current Population Survey -- Annual Social and Economic Supplements. That survey also asks households about income, but over a given calendar year. The census’ Current Population Survey was just released for 2011. The median income: $50,054. Green told us the comparable figure in his work is Sentier’s January 2012 index because it asked respondents about their income for the previous 12 months. In that case, those months are calendar year 2011. Sentier’s median income for that period: $50,020, a difference of just $34. That would indicate that Sentier's methodology produces a number very close to the official census number. Sentier’s index is a new measuring stick, and not time-tested, but Green and Coder are both retired from the census, and their work has been widely cited in the media. "The Census Bureau is the source of official statistics," Green said. "What we do is fill it in with the monthly data." Other factors This brings us to the dicey issue of blaming Obama for the trend, whatever it is. At PolitiFact, we don’t only assess the accuracy of statistics cited in political claims, but whether it’s valid to say a certain politician is responsible. We asked Dean Baker, co-director of the left-leaning Center for Economic and Policy Research, for his take. "There is always a problem in attributing outcomes to presidents based on their terms, since there are a large number of erratic factors over which they have no control. This is especially the case with President Obama, who inherited an economy that was falling off a cliff," Baker said. He added that a better question is what Romney or anyone else would have done that would have produced better results. "Romney seems to be saying that a big tax cut would have done the trick with little or no money to help the states or for any of the other spending components of the stimulus. That doesn't seem very plausible to me, but that is the question that we should be asking," Baker said. Plus, a look back at incomes over several years shows that incomes track the state of the overall economy. According to the census, the median income hit an all-time high in 1999 (when you adjust for inflation), reaching $54,932. It decreased each year through 2004, hitting $52,788. It then climbed again until 2007 -- the beginning of the recession -- to $54,489, and has been on the way down since then. Sentier’s research also reflects steady increases with small dips and peaks over the past decade. Dan Mitchell, a scholar with the libertarian Cato Institute, had this to say about the blame factor: "That drop started before Obama took office, so I don't think he deserves full blame for everything after Jan. 20, 2009," Mitchell said. "But this has been a very weak recovery, so clearly he should be held responsible for some of the bad news." Our ruling Romney’s ad says that "under Obama families have lost over $4,000 a year in income." That figure comes from a new but well-respected index created by Sentier Research, which tracked a decline in the median family income from the month Obama took office through June 2012. It’s tricky to compare that data with census data because they represent different time periods. But where it is possible to compare Sentier with the census, the results are within a few dollars of each other. But the ad’s claim runs into trouble by overtly blaming Obama. The economy was on a downward track before he took office, and a president has limited control over those forces. To the extent he should be held responsible, Mitchell told us, the slow recovery has all been on his watch. Romney’s ad cites trustworthy figures but oversimplifies the issue by assigning blame to Obama. We rate it Half True.	None	Mitt Romney	None	None	None	2012-09-19T11:57:58	2012-09-17	['None']
pomt-13328	Says Donald Trump, in his campaign announcement speech, "also said, ‘And many of them (Mexicans) are good people. You keep leaving that out of your quote."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/oct/05/mike-pence/mike-pence-tidies-donald-trumps-quote-about-mexica/	During the vice presidential debate, Indiana Gov. Mike Pence found himself having to defend past statements made by his ticket-mate, Donald Trump, again and again. At one point, Tim Kaine, a Virginia senator, lit into Pence by saying, "When Donald Trump says women should be punished, or Mexicans are rapists and criminals…" After some crosstalk, Pence responded, "Senator, you've whipped out that Mexican thing again." Kaine continued to press his case, saying, "Can you defend it?" Pence: "There are criminal aliens in this country, Tim, who have come into this country illegally who are perpetrating violence and taking American lives." Kaine: "You want to use a big broad brush against Mexicans on that?" Pence: "He also said, ‘And many of them are good people.’ You keep leaving that out of your quote." Unfortunately for Pence, his memory was a little faulty. The exchange centered on comments Trump made last year in the speech at Trump Tower in New York City when he kicked off his presidential campaign. Here’s the relevant portion of what Trump said: "When Mexico sends its people, they’re not sending their best. They’re not sending you. They’re not sending you. They’re sending people that have lots of problems, and they’re bringing those problems with us. They’re bringing drugs. They’re bringing crime. They’re rapists. And some, I assume, are good people." Pence has a point that there was more to Trump’s comment than just that "Mexicans are rapists and criminals," as Kaine said during the debate. In fact, we have previously taken Kaine to task for oversimplifying Trump’s Trump Tower comment. In August, we gave Kaine a False for saying that Trump had said that "all Mexicans are rapists." But Pence went too far in downplaying the severity of Trump’s original comment. According to Pence, Trump said that "many" Mexicans are "good people." In reality, Trump said "some" rather than "many," which doesn’t sound as magnanimous. And Trump further undercut that sentiment by adding a grudging, "I assume." Our ruling Pence said that Trump, in his campaign announcement speech, "also said and many of them (Mexicans) are good people. You keep leaving that out of your quote." Pence is right that Kaine left that part of the comment out of the quote. But the part Kaine left out is not quite as benign as Pence indicates. Trump said "some," rather than "many," and he prefaced that by saying, "I assume." The statement partially accurate but leaves out important context, so we rate it Half True.

pomt-14409	"Americans haven’t had a raise in 15 years."	mostly true	/iowa/statements/2016/mar/11/hillary-clinton/hillary-clinton-ad-points-out-its-been-15-years-am/	As Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton pledged to "root out" several barriers to progress in a TV ad that aired ahead of the South Carolina primary in February, she offered one specific statistic to underscore the challenges facing average Americans. "Americans haven’t had a raise in 15 years," she says in the 30-second ad, which aired more than 150 times on four networks in the Columbia, S.C., TV market beginning on Feb. 20 and lasting through the Feb. 27 Democratic primary. The spot was captured by the Political Ad Archive, a database maintained by the nonprofit Internet Archive. Incomes are obviously highly variable among individuals, and many people have seen their wages increase since 2001. But economists and federal agencies keep data on aggregate income growth that can tell us, on average, whether Americans’ incomes are rising. To evaluate Clinton’s claim, we’ll start by looking at inflation-adjusted median household income, which takes into account rising prices when comparing average income levels across time. According to an analysis of U.S. Census Data performed by the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, median household income dropped from $57,843 in January, 1999, to $53,657 in January, 2014, the most recent period for which statistics are available. That’s a 7 percent drop, and supports Clinton’s assertion that Americans haven’t seen their incomes rise over the last decade and a half. (These figures account for inflation by expressing income from both years in 2014 dollars.) Another way to measure whether Americans have "had a raise" would be to look at a narrower slice of the population: full-time workers over the age of 16. The Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis draws on U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics data to show median usual weekly earnings for these workers. In January, 2000, the average worker earned $334 a week. By January, 2015, that figure was $341 – a 2 percent increase. ($334 a week equates to $17,368 a year, while $341 per week is $17,732. These inflation-adjusted figures are expressed in 2015 dollars.) As we’ve explained before, we could judge Clinton’s claim on this second figure, since it captures people who are employed full-time on a wage and salary basis and who could receive a "raise" as that term is commonly understood. That said, median household income is the broadest measure of income growth, and arguably the more appropriate one to use in this context. Many households receive at least a portion of their income from government transfer payments, such as Social Security, or from investments – income that isn’t reflected in wages or salary data alone. Because median household income encompasses a wider range of income sources, it’s reasonable for Clinton to base her statement on that measurement. Our ruling Clinton’s campaign ad claims, "Americans haven’t had a raise in 15 years." Inflation-adjusted median household income has indeed dropped 7 percent over that period, while earnings for wage and salary workers have increased a modest 2 percent. We rate Clinton’s statement Mostly True. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/90f91331-9cee-4c32-903f-f5b27803d730	None	Hillary Clinton	None	None	None	2016-03-11T12:15:55	2016-02-20	['United_States']
pomt-12170	"The border is down 78 percent. Under past administrations, the border didn’t go down -- it went up."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2017/aug/03/donald-trump/false-trumps-claim-about-illegal-immigration-under/	President Donald Trump, in a speech about the brutality of MS-13 gang members and his administration’s resolve to deport criminal immigrants, claimed it wasn’t until he came along that border crossings went down. "You know, the border is down 78 percent. Under past administrations, the border didn’t go down, it went up. But if it went down 1 percent, it was like this was a great thing. Down 78 percent," Trump said in New York on July 28. "And, in fact, the southern border of Mexico, we did them a big favor -- believe me. They get very little traffic in there anymore, because they know they're not going to get through the border to the United States. So that whole group has been incredible, led by General (John) Kelly." Trump congratulated Kelly for doing "an incredible job" as secretary of Homeland Security, and at a July 31 Cabinet meeting — the first for Kelly as Trump's new chief of staff — reiterated his pride for reductions in illegal immigration. "As you know, the border was a tremendous problem, and they’re close to 80 percent stoppage. And even the president of Mexico called me — they said their southern border, very few people are coming because they know they’re not going to get through our border, which is the ultimate compliment," Trump said. Based on past statements Trump has made, his remarks that "the border is down 78 percent" refer to apprehensions of immigrants trying to enter the country illegally. But calculations of different time periods do not show a 78 percent decline. The claim that under past administrations apprehensions did not go down is not accurate. ‘The border is down 78 percent’ Trump uses different timeframes to make a case that illegal immigration is down. He has looked at year-over-year March border apprehension data to say there’s been a 64 percent decline; compared February 2017 numbers to the election month, November 2016, to say it’s gone down 61 percent; and said there was a 40 percent decline from January, the month he was inaugurated, to February. Where does the 78 percent come from? We asked the White House but did not get a response. From June 2016 to June 2017, apprehensions at the southwest border went down 53 percent. U.S. Customs and Border Protection data also show that from November to June (latest available figures), apprehensions by border patrol agents declined about 66 percent. From January to June, it declined 49 percent. From Trump’s first full month in office, February, to June, it went down 14 percent. And though they remain low, the number of apprehensions actually picked up in May and in June. As the Washington Post’s Fact Checker noted, Trump’s claim of apprehensions nearing 80 percent is clearer when comparing cherry-picked figures: the highest point in fiscal year 2017 (November) to the lowest point (April). That yields a 76.4 percent decline. ‘The border didn’t go down, it went up’ Trump also claimed, "Under past administrations, the border didn’t go down, it went up. But if it went down 1 percent, it was like this was a great thing." In fact, apprehensions have gone down under past administrations. Unauthorized immigration also fell dramatically during the George W. Bush and Barack Obama administrations, said Christopher Wilson, deputy director of the Mexico Institute at the Wilson Center. Analyses of monthly and annual apprehension statistics show declines for both Bush and Obama’s administrations. "No matter how you look at it, Trump is far from the first U.S. president to preside over big drops in unauthorized immigration," Wilson said. Apprehension rates at the southern border have plummeted since the 1980s. In 1986 there were 1.6 million apprehensions – about 1.2 million more than in 2016. The decline hasn’t been as steady, however, as there have been increases and decreases over the years. During the 1980s, there was an annual average of 1 million border patrol apprehensions at the southwest border. During the Obama administration, the average was below 500,000. FactCheck.org also pointed out that apprehensions declined 75 percent from fiscal years 2000 to 2016. Our ruling Referring to border apprehensions, Trump said, "The border is down 78 percent. Under past administrations, the border didn’t go down, it went up." Calculations of the latest figures available from U.S. Customs and Border Protection do not show a 78 percent decline in apprehensions. The closest number to that would be based on cherry-picked numbers of the highest number of apprehensions in November to the lowest number, in April. Though there have been fluctuations over the years in the number of apprehensions, they certainly have gone down under past administrations. We rate Trump’s claim False.

pomt-07842	Four state Assembly Democrats "scored a death blow to northeast Wisconsin’s economy" by killing hundreds of jobs at a potential Bass Pro Shops near Green Bay.	pants on fire!	/wisconsin/statements/2011/feb/13/scott-suder/majority-leader-scott-suder-says-letter-four-assem/	The potent combination of the Green Bay Packers, jobs and the great outdoors formed a fine kettle of fish in Madison. The Journal Sentinel revealed Jan. 13, 2011, that outdoors retailer Bass Pro Shops was part of a development that businessman John Bergstrom was planning for a small piece of land near Lambeau Field in Green Bay. That proposal, however, was hung up because part of the site had been designated a wetland. Environmental groups had raised objections, prompting an administrative review that could tack months onto the process. As the Jan. 13 story noted, Gov. Scott Walker stepped in and had drafted an unusually specific piece of legislation that exempted the parcel from the environmental review. As a vote neared, four Democratic members of the state Assembly sent a letter Jan. 26, 2011, to Bass Pro Shops founder Johnny Morris asking for a compromise on the project that would protect wetlands and the state’s fish population. Two days later, Bass Pro Shops issued a short statement that said the company does not build stores on wetlands. A spokesman said the chain had held discussions with Bergstrom but said there was no deal. All pretty straightforward. Later that afternoon, Rep. Scott Suder (R-Abbotsford) let fly with two statements on the topic -- a news release and an e-mail blast. The headline on the news release said "Dems Kill Hundreds of Jobs in NE Wisconsin." The release went on to say: "Liberal Democrats in Madison scored a death blow to northeast Wisconsin's economy by winning a battle for the far left agenda." That gives a lot of credit to the out-of-power Democrats, who were using the old tactic of writing a letter -- and releasing it to the media -- to gain attention. So, did the letter from the Dems scare off a national retail chain with 50 stores in 26 states? We asked Suder for evidence that the company had made its decision -- essentially overnight -- in response to the letter. "Certainly, the letter that was sent caused Bass Pro Shops to hesitate," Suder said, though he acknowledged he had no contact with the retailer about the matter. Let’s fish out some details on the project: The project has been around for more than a year. Environmentalists raised the wetlands concerns about the would-be Bass Pro Shops parcel months ago and their challenge was pending before the letter was written. Bass Pro Shops was first reported to be involved in the project on Jan. 13, 2011. The company had not publicly expressed a commitment to the project development, seen as a "gateway" to Lambeau Field. Local Department of Natural Resources staff in Green Bay objected to the project, but superiors in Madison had already said it should be allowed to proceed. The author of the letter was state Rep. Brett Hulsey (D-Madison). He said he had met Morris -- the Bass Pro Shops founder -- years ago, when Hulsey worked for the Clinton administration. "I could not imagine Johnny Morris and Bass Pro building on a wetlands because of the company’s core conservation principles," said Hulsey. He said a Bass Pro Shops executive called him the day after the letter was sent and said the company was interested in Wisconsin but did not build on wetlands. Despite the company’s position, the Legislature passed the bill exempting the parcel from the water quality review and Walker signed it Feb. 3, 2011. Walker said that in the past the "bureaucracy got in the way" and his administration wanted to send the message: "You can conserve and protect wetlands while having an economic project move forward." However, some believe the action will make the location less desirable, at least from a public relations point of view. Said Hulsey: "It’s been contaminated by this bill." Indeed, the fact wetlands were an issue may have had a special impact with Bass Pro Shops, which has no Wisconsin locations. "For an outdoor retailer, that’s a more sensitive subject than for another one," said Neil Stern, senior partner with McMillan Doolittle, a company that advises retailers. His firm previously worked for Cabela’s, a Bass Pro Shops competitor. "They want an arm’s length from any controversy," he said of Bass Pro Shops. In its statement, Bass Pro Shops noted the company "has a long and proud tradition of our conservation efforts and is a very conservation minded company. We have been recognized many times by conservation organizations across America for those conservation efforts. We were unaware of any wetlands issues and have not and will not be in favor of doing anything to harm wetlands wherever they might be." Let’s return to Suder’s statement, which said the letter by the Democrats torpedoed hundreds of jobs and was the death knell for the region’s economy. That’s a huge overreach. Had the store opened it would have created about 300 retail jobs. State records show that the Green Bay area in December had about 161,000 jobs. And the region is a much broader area than that. OK, let’s pull this fish into the boat and see what we’ve got. Suder charges that by sending a letter to Bass Pro Shops, four Democrats killed the project -- and with it, hundreds of jobs in Green Bay, dealing "a death blow to northeast Wisconsin’s economy." That’s one heck of a poison pen. But there was no agreement between the developer and Bass Pro Shops and the wetlands objections had been raised by DNR staffers and environmentalists long before the Democratic lawmakers weighed in. Indeed, Walker and the Legislature were already moving to address the concerns about the wetlands issue slowing the project even before the letter. What’s more, the number of jobs in question -- welcome as they would be -- certainly doesn’t rate as a death blow to an entire region’s economy. Suder’s pen is filled with red, flame-colored ink.

pomt-11132	"We are the only metropolitan area in the country that’s losing population."	mostly false	/illinois/statements/2018/jun/01/lori-lightfoot/no-chicagoland-isnt-only-metro-area-losing-residen/	A Chicago mayoral hopeful vying to represent the city’s progressive wing recently leapt into the race with a talking point about population drain. Lori Lightfoot, an attorney who previously headed Mayor Rahm Emanuel’s police board, joined the growing crowd of potential candidates seeking to unseat him in May. In multiple media appearances following the announcement of her candidacy, Lightfoot argued high tax burdens under Emanuel are driving families of modest means out of the city. "The fact that we are the only metropolitan area in the country that’s losing population ought to be a sense of urgency," Lightfoot said during a WGN radio interview. "To me, it’s the proverbial canary in the mine shaft." The city of Chicago’s population drain is well-documented. Chicago lost residents in 2017 for the third year in a row, the latest Census data show, and its population has been on a mostly uninterrupted decline since peaking at 3.6 million in 1950. Even so, at 2.7 million residents today, Chicago remains the nation’s third largest city. But the "metropolitan area" extends far beyond the city of Chicago, not just in colloquial terms but in those clearly recognized by the nation’s official head-counters at the U.S. Census Bureau. So the claim that the Chicago metropolitan area was the only one out of hundreds in the U.S. to lose population struck us as a demographic head-scratcher worth checking out. The meaning of ‘metropolitan area’ The Census assesses population change in metropolitan areas along officially designated lines that include counties with close ties to a core urban area. Almost a quarter of those 391 defined metropolitan areas experienced population loss between 2016 and 2017, according to Census data. The Census defines the Chicago metropolitan area quite expansively, taking in not just Chicago and Cook County but eight other counties in Illinois as well as four in Indiana and one in Wisconsin. The Chicago metro area is among the nation’s 10 largest, and Census estimates found that none of the other nine lost population in 2017. That said, some other still sizable metropolitan areas, including those surrounding Pittsburgh, Pa., and Rochester, N.Y., did shrink. "Chicago technically is a place," explained Chicago demographer Rob Paral. "It is different than a metro area." That distinction might be chalked up to a slip of the tongue by Lightfoot had she not repeated the phrase "metropolitan area" in campaign talking points on at least three occasions. A Lightfoot spokeswoman said in an email that while the candidate is saying "metropolitan area," she is only referring to the city of Chicago itself. In comparison to the nation’s other largest cities, the spokeswoman said, Chicago was the only one to experience a decline in 2016, the latest year for which city-specific data was available at the time Lightfoot made her claim. "Lori is running to become the next mayor of Chicago and when she addresses population loss, she's referring to the fact that we are on a radically different trajectory than other major metropolitan cities like Los Angeles, New York, Boston or Philadelphia," the spokeswoman said. While the Lightfoot campaign is correct that Chicago was the only one of the nation’s biggest cities to see losses, it was far from the only city to slip. And the candidate’s original comments did not reference cities at all, let alone distinguish between major cities or otherwise. Paral, the independent demographics researcher, also took issue with the Lightfoot campaign’s characterization of Chicago’s population trajectory as "radically" different from other large cities. None of the major cities her spokeswoman cited, for instance, gained population by even a full percentage point last year, while Chicago fell by just 0.14 percent, and the gap between them the year prior was not much greater. That makes the difference in their rate of change relatively nominal. Making it in Chicago We also asked Paral about Lightfoot’s broader argument that taxes were responsible for driving low- and middle-income residents away. "I think the jury is out on that," he said, adding that the correlation between tax rates and population change "isn’t that strong." Lightfoot does seem to find more solid ground in highlighting how an income gap may be playing a role in which Chicago-area residents decide to stay or go. A recent analysis by the Chicago Metropolitan Agency for Planning found the number of people living in the Chicago region making less than $25,000 shrank between 2006 and 2016, while the number of residents making $75,000 or more grew. "The loss of low-income residents in the region suggests that we’re not being so inclusive," said Aseal Tineh, the policy analyst who wrote the report. But the planning agency says it has not conducted research into links between population loss and taxes, which is the connection Lightfoot is trying to make. Our ruling While arguing that high taxes are pushing lower-income earners out of Chicago, Lightfoot said: "We are the only metropolitan area in the country that’s losing population." Lightfoot has used the "metropolitan area" phrase repeatedly in the opening days of her campaign for mayor, though a spokeswoman now says when she uses the word "metropolitan" we should really insert the words "major city."’ It could be tempting to cut Lightfoot some rhetorical slack in her quest for the mayoralty. After all, the original Mayor Richard Daley got so routinely tongue-tied that his exasperated press secretary famously admonished reporters: "Don’t write what he says, write what he means." In Lightfoot’s case, however, it's not clear exactly what she means. She keeps repeating an incorrect statement that is wrong whether taken literally or figuratively. The Chicago metropolitan area is far from the only one in the country to lose population last year, according to the Census. And the city of Chicago by itself is far from the only city to lose population--though as the spokeswoman later pointed out, it is the only one among the nation’s very biggest cities. Experts also cast doubt on the existence of any evidence to back up the other beat of her claim, that lower-income Chicago residents were leaving because of high taxes. Lightfoot’s comments use a precise term imprecisely to make an unproven argument about population loss. We rate her claim Mostly False.

pomt-00979	"Over 200 years ago, the United States had declared war on Islam, and Thomas Jefferson led the charge!"	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/feb/11/chain-email/barbary-wars-did-us-declare-war-islam/	Ask most Americans about the details of the Barbary wars, and you’re likely to get blank stares. But the obscure, early 19th century wars between the newly established United States and a group of north African powers has become evidence for a chain email that lectures about the present-day dangers of radical Islam. Here are excerpts from the chain email. "Most Americans are unaware of the fact that over 200 years ago, the United States had declared war on Islam, and Thomas Jefferson led the charge! "At the height of the 18th century, Muslim pirates were the terror of the Mediterranean and a large area of the North Atlantic. They attacked every ship in sight, and held the crews for exorbitant ransoms. Those taken hostage were subjected to barbaric treatment and wrote heart breaking letters home, begging their government and family members to pay whatever their Mohammedan captors demanded. "These extortionists of the high seas represented the Islamic nations of Tripoli, Tunis, Morocco, and Algiers -- collectively referred to as the Barbary Coast and presented a dangerous and unprovoked threat to the new American Republic. ..." "Islam, and what its Barbary followers justified doing in the name of their prophet and their god, disturbed Jefferson quite deeply. America had a tradition of religious tolerance. In fact, Jefferson himself, had co-authored the Virginia Statute for Religious Freedom, but fundamentalist Islam was like no other religion the world had ever seen. "A religion based on supremacism, whose holy book not only condoned but mandated violence against unbelievers was unacceptable to him. His greatest fear was that someday this brand of Islam would return and pose an even greater threat to the United States." This excerpt offers a lot to chew over (and the full text includes even more), but for this fact-check we’re going to focus on the opening claim -- that "over 200 years ago, the United States had declared war on Islam, and Thomas Jefferson led the charge!" Some background on the Barbary Wars The Barbary wars aren’t entirely forgotten -- they are the source of the lyric "to the shores of Tripoli" in the Marine Hymn, among other things. But they did occur more than two centuries ago, so they offer fertile ground for questionable claims. The wars -- the first fought between 1801 and 1805 and a second in 1815 -- followed centuries of piracy in the Mediterranean by semi-autonomous outposts of the Ottoman Empire, including Tripoli and Algeria. Historians describe these actions as a well-developed protection racket. Countries paid hefty monetary "tributes" to the north African powers in order to get free passage for their ships. Countries that refused would risk being boarded, with crew members held hostage and cargo confiscated. (Technically, this was not "piracy," which is committed by non-state actors; the proper term for such government-backed privateering is "corsairing.") Over the years, many seafaring European nations concluded that payment of tribute was the lesser of two evils, so they complied. During the era of the American colonies, American merchant vessels received protection by virtue of being of being British; the British were among the countries that paid tribute. Then, during the American Revolution, an alliance with France protected American ships. But full independence brought an end to that. Initially, the United States decided to pay tribute. But American leaders, including Jefferson, seethed at having to do it, saying it would only inspire more and more outrageous financial demands. On July 11, 1786, Jefferson wrote to John Adams, "I very early thought it would be best to effect a peace thro' the medium of war." The following month, he wrote to James Monroe that the Barbary powers "must see the rod; perhaps it must be felt by some one of them." After Jefferson became president in 1801, he rejected Tripoli's demand for payment. The pasha of Tripoli countered by declaring war on the United States. Jefferson sent forces to the Mediterranean, and after sporadic combat, hostilities ended four years later with a negotiated settlement in which the United States paid a smaller tribute than had initially been demanded. The era of Barbary corsairs effectively ended a decade later, when, after the U.S. Navy, battle-hardened from the War of 1812, won a quick victory against Algiers, effectively ending all tribute payments. The role of Islam in the Barbary wars Not only did the United States never officially "declare war" (as the email puts it) against any of the Barbary powers, but historians of the period also say that religion was not a significant factor in the Barbary wars. To be sure, the Barbary powers were Muslim, and mentions of Islam and Christianity do pop up at times in the historical record. But historians say it was more like fighting the mafia than religious zealots. As early as 1797, the United States made clear in a treaty with Tripoli that "as the government of the United States of America is not in any sense founded on the Christian Religion, as it has in itself no character of enmity against the laws, religion or tranquility of Musselmen (Muslims) and as the said States never have entered into any war or act of hostility against any Mehomitan (Mohammedan or Muslim) nation, it is declared by the parties that no pretext arising from religious opinions shall ever produce an interruption of the harmony existing between the two countries." The experts we contacted agreed that the email vastly overplays the available evidence. "Very little of this had to do with Islam," said Adrian Tinniswood, author of Pirates of Barbary: Corsairs, Conquests and Captivity in the Seventeenth-Century Mediterranean. "It had much more to do with trading opportunities and economics." "We didn't attack them out of matters of faith," said Lance Janda, a military historian at Cameron University. "The wars were all about freedom of the sea and protecting the U.S. flag." Robert C. Davis, author of Christian Slaves, Muslim Masters: White Slavery in the Mediterranean, the Barbary Coast and Italy, went so far as to slam the email as "so riddled with errors, bad logic, and innuendo that I have to wonder why you feel called upon to critique it." Our ruling The chain email said that "over 200 years ago, the United States had declared war on Islam, and Thomas Jefferson led the charge!" The Barbary powers were Muslim, and religion sometimes crops up in the historical record. But historians agree that the overriding motivation of American military action against the Barbary pirates was to secure a vital national interest, namely protecting the U.S. merchant fleet and its ability to conduct international trade. They see no evidence that Jefferson or his contemporaries were undertaking a religious holy war. So we rate the claim False.

pomt-15275	Under Gov. Scott Walker, Wisconsin "projected a $1 billion (budget) surplus and it turns out to be a deficit of $2.2 billion."	mostly false	/wisconsin/statements/2015/jul/28/donald-trump/donald-trump-says-under-scott-walker-wisconsin-bud/	On July 25, 2015, the day after news that a Scott Walker ally had called him a "dumb-dumb," Donald Trump delighted in dumping on the Wisconsin governor during a campaign speech in Iowa. "I read this horrible statement from his fundraiser about Trump. I said, ‘Oh, finally, I can attack,’ " the New York businessman said to laughter in Oskaloosa. "Finally, finally." Trump -- second to Walker among Republican presidential contenders in an Iowa poll earlier in the week -- criticized him on several fronts. Then he made a claim about the fortunes of Wisconsin’s finances. "Wisconsin’s doing terribly. First of all, it’s in turmoil," Trump said. "The roads are a disaster because they don’t have any money to rebuild them. They’re borrowing money like crazy. They projected a $1 billion surplus and it turns out to be a deficit of $2.2 billion." Let’s focus on that last part. Is Trump right that a projected $1 billion surplus became a $2.2 billion deficit? Trump is partly on the money, but he’s mixing apples and oranges, and his use of the word deficit is problematic. The rules By law, Wisconsin’s two-year budgets must be balanced -- revenue equalling expenditures. So, unlike the federal government, Wisconsin can never run an actual budget deficit by borrowing money that piles up as debt. That being said, the state does various projections of what revenues and expenditures will be for the upcoming two-year budget cycle. Those projections can show a surplus or a deficit -- although "deficit" is more accurately termed a projected shortfall, since there is no actual red ink. Trump’s campaign didn’t respond to our requests for evidence to back his claim. But the two figures he cited were projections that received plenty of attention when they were made. And we have dealt with them repeatedly in the past. The two figures In January 2014, the nonpartisan Legislative Fiscal Bureau projected Wisconsin would see a surplus of about $1 billion by June 30, 2015 -- the end of the 2013-’15 budget cycle. At the time, revenues were coming in higher than expected. Walker and the GOP-run Legislature adopted a series of tax cuts later in 2014, making good on a Walker promise to return such surpluses to taxpayers, but drawing criticism for not using the money for other purposes, such as boosting the state’s rainy day fund. Along the way, however, tax collections grew at a slower pace than had been projected. By November 2014, there was a reversal of fortune: Walker’s own Department of Administration projected a $2.2 billion shortfall for 2015-’17. Once again, that figure was not an actual deficit. Indeed, even as a projected shortfall it was overstated. That’s because the standard for projections made in the months leading up to the next budget cycle is to include all the funding requests made by state agencies -- even though, in reality, those requests always get trimmed. That serves to temporarily inflate the actual picture. In the end, the 2015-’17 budget approved by the Legislature and signed by Walker in July 2015 was balanced -- just as every other Wisconsin state budget is. Our rating Mixing apples and oranges, Trump said that under Walker, Wisconsin "projected a $1 billion (budget) surplus and it turns out to be a deficit of $2.2 billion." There was in early 2014 a projection of a $1 billion surplus heading into the 2015-’17 budget period. Late in 2014, there was a projection of a $2.2 billion shortfall -- the difference between expected revenues and the amount of money being requested by state agencies. But the shortfall was never a deficit -- and some of the surplus was consciously spent by Republicans, as tax cuts. For a statement that contains only an element of truth and ignores critical facts that would give a different impression, our rating is Mostly False.

pomt-14595	China is "practicing how to blow up our satellites."	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/feb/04/marco-rubio/marco-rubio-says-china-practicing-how-blow-our-sat/	The 2016 presidential campaign has inspired discussion of plenty of scary foreign-policy scenarios, from ISIS attacks to cyber warfare. But at a Feb. 3 town hall in Manchester, N.H., Republican presidential candidate Marco Rubio offered one we hadn’t heard much about – the possibility that China could blow an American satellite out of the sky. China, Rubio said, is "practicing how to blow up our satellites." Experts told PolitiFact that Rubio is basically right. "Regrettably true," Michael Krepon, a space-policy expert and co-founder of the Stimson Center, said of the claim. Most spectacular was an incident on Jan. 11, 2007, when a six-foot-long Chinese weather satellite flew over China and was blasted to smithereens by an 18,000-mile-per-hour missile launched by China. "And then it was gone, transformed into a cloud of debris hurtling at nearly 16,000 mph along the main thoroughfare used by orbiting spacecraft," as Popular Mechanics magazine put it. China’s destruction of its own missile inspired "a great deal of international rebuke," said Laura Grego, a senior scientist with the global security program at the Union of Concerned Scientists. In addition to bringing up the touchy notion of the militarization of space, the satellite destruction created a sizable debris field in its heavily trafficked band around the earth, potentially causing secondhand damage to other nations’ satellites for the foreseeable future. There are about 1,300 active satellites, according to Scientific American. The technology China used, known as "hit-to-kill," doesn’t technically "blow up" the satellite, as Rubio had said. No explosives are involved, only the force of impact of a missile-launched "kill vehicle." "This is the same technology that the U.S. missile defense systems are based on," Grego said. "In fact, the U.S. used the Aegis ship-based missile defense system to destroy the USA 193 satellite just over a year after the Chinese test." Which brings up a point worth noting: China isn’t the only one playing this game. Russia and the United States have been testing anti-satellite technology since the 1960s. In fact, when the United States, a year after China destroyed its satellite, destroyed one of its own, cables released by Wikileaks suggest was a mission with military significance. "Russia and the United States either have experimented with or deployed similar technologies" as China, said Theresa Hitchens, a senior research scholar at the Center for International and Security Studies at the University of Maryland. "Indeed, the Chinese are actually behind both Russia and the United States regarding development of these technologies. Nothing China has tested is anything that the U.S. has not tested before." A further complication: Technologies that can be used to destroy satellites can also be used for benign purposes. Ballistic missiles can destroy satellites – or they can be used legitimately for missile defense. And satellites themselves can be maneuvered to damage or destroy nearby satellites – or they can be maneuvered for repair or refueling, Hitchens said. This is known as "dual-use" technology. This makes it hard to discern motives. In fact, China has "officially said its tests are not aimed at any other country, and it has been a longtime proponent of trying to manage this issue using space arms control," Grego said. But it’s difficult to prove a purely defensive motive when dealing with such dual-use technologies, Hitchens said. "We see them doing dual-use experiments and assume it’s for nefarious purposes, and they see us doing dual-use experiments and assume nefarious purposes," she said. This kind of thinking can produce an arms race. Still, experts said it was fair for Rubio to point out China’s development of technologies that can be used to attack satellites, since it’s a threat to national security even if we’re working on much the same thing. "The reality is that satellites are increasingly valuable to civil, economic, scientific, and military operations, yet they are physically quite vulnerable, since launch mass is at a premium and no one armors their satellites, and satellite positions are predictable," Grego said. Our ruling Rubio said China is "practicing how to blow up our satellites." For years, China has been pursuing technologies that can be used to destroy satellites (as well as legitimate things). In fact, the Chinese destroyed one of their own satellites in 2007, in a move that was roundly condemned internationally. While the United States and Russia have also been developing similar technologies, and in one case destroyed an actual satellite, that doesn’t undercut Rubio’s statement. We rate it True.

pomt-14947	Says Marco Rubio opposes abortion "even in the case of rape and incest."	mostly true	/punditfact/statements/2015/oct/25/jennifer-granholm/liberal-pundit-marco-rubio-opposes-rape-incest-abo/	The struggles of Jeb Bush have pundits rethinking who will emerge as the Republican establishment alternative to 2016 outsiders like Ben Carson and Donald Trump. A name that keeps surfacing: Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla. Rubio is the "candidate who seems to be in the cat-bird’s seat right now," said ABC’s George Stephanopoulos. Stephanopoulos asked liberal pundit and former Michigan Gov. Jennifer Granholm if Rubio has Democrats worried. Not really, Granholm said. "He’s one of the most extreme," she said. "For example, he doesn’t agree with a woman’s right to choose even in the case of rape or incest," Granholm said. We previously looked into some of Rubio’s statements and votes regarding abortion. Does he oppose abortion in the case of rape or incest? Rubio’s debate comments Rubio discussed his position on abortion during the first Republican presidential debate, Aug. 6, 2015, in Cleveland. We’ll show you the exchange between Rubio and moderator Megyn Kelly. Kelly: "You favor a rape and incest exception to abortion bans. Cardinal Timothy Dolan of New York just said yesterday those exceptions are preposterous. He said they discriminate against an entire class of human beings. If you believe that life begins at conception, as you say you do, how do you justify ending a life just because it begins violently, through no fault of the baby?" Rubio: "Well, Megyn, first of all, I'm not sure that that's a correct assessment of my record. I would go on to add that I believe all --" Kelly: "You don't favor a rape and incest exception?" Rubio: "I have never said that. And I have never advocated that. What I have advocated is that we pass a law in this country that says all human life at every stage of its development is worthy of protection. In fact, I think that law already exists. It is called the Constitution of the United States." The exchange is noteworthy for two reasons. First, Rubio bristles at the suggestion that he favors abortion exceptions for rape and incest. But, he also never definitively answers Kelly’s question about his position. NBC’s Chuck Todd tried to get clarity a few days later on Meet the Press. The takeaway: Rubio supports legislation that makes abortion more rare whether or not exceptions for rape and incest are included. So that means he’ll support legislation that reduces abortion even if it includes exceptions. But that also means he doesn’t necessarily believe that an exception should be included in every piece of abortion legislation. "I'll support any legislation that reduces the number of abortions, so that means a 20-week abortion ban. At five months, a child -- you'll recognize it as a human being in an ultrasound image. And I'll support that. That doesn't obviously cover the whole gamut, but it reduces the number of abortions," Rubio said. "I'll support any legislation that reduces the number of abortions and there are those that have that exception in it. What I've never done is said I require that it must have or not have exceptions." Granholm’s office pointed us toward several news accounts highlighting Rubio’s position and the exchange between Kelly and Rubio. The articles largely reach the same conclusion: Rubio will support anti-abortion legislation that includes an exception for rape and incest, but he prefers that the procedure be illegal even in cases of rape and incest. "I personally believe you do not correct one tragedy with a second tragedy. That's how I personally feel very strongly about," Rubio said Aug. 7, 2015, on CNN. "I believe all human life irrespective of the circumstances in which it came into being is worthy of the protection of our laws. I recognize this is a tough question. It's a very difficult question. And I understand that. Believe me, I do. But by the same token if I have to weigh the two equities here, I'm always going to err on the side of life." Rubio’s record on abortion Rubio, for the record, has supported legislation in the Senate that includes exceptions for rape and incest. In November 2013, Rubio was one of 40 co-sponsors of a Senate bill entitled "Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act." Several GOP presidential candidates backed the bill, including main sponsor Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and co-sponsors Ted Cruz of Texas and Rand Paul of Kentucky. The bill bans abortions at 20 weeks or greater but includes exceptions, including rape and incest. Graham sponsored a similar version in 2015 -- and again Rubio is listed as one of dozens of co-sponsors. The 2015 version also has a rape exception, although the language differs. It requires adult women to obtain counseling or medical treatment for the rape 48 hours before the abortion, with separate criteria for minors about reporting the rape to law enforcement. Rubio has long been an opponent of abortion rights, and his record bears that out. National Right to Life gave him a 100 percent rating for the 112th and 113th congresses. In both sessions, the ratings were based on five votes, such as cutting off funding for Planned Parenthood, repealing or defunding the Affordable Care Act and protecting free speech. The Family Research Council also gave Rubio a 100 percent rating for 13 votes in 2013-14. And NARAL, a group that supports abortion rights, gave Rubio a zero every year between 2011 and 2014. "I personally and deeply believe that all human life is worthy of the protection of our laws, I do," Rubio said in his Meet the Press interview. "And I believe that irrespective of the conditions by which that life was conceived or anything else, and for me to be consistent on that belief, that's why I feel so strongly about it. "That being said, I recognize that in order to have a consensus on laws that limit the number of abortions, a lot of people want to see those exceptions and that's why I've supported those laws in the past, as has every pro-life group in America." Our ruling Granholm said Rubio opposes abortion "even in the case of rape and incest." The record suggests Rubio has staked out a slightly more nuanced position. Rubio is staunchly anti-abortion and has suggested he personally opposes abortion in cases of rape and incest, but he has supported abortion legislation that include those exceptions. Rubio says he supports legislation that makes abortion more rare. Granholm’s statement is accurate but needs clarification. We rate it Mostly True.

pomt-01137	"We're spending millions for each individual" held at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba.	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2014/dec/21/barack-obama/obama-were-spending-millions-each-individual-held-/	On his second day in office in 2009, President Barack Obama ordered that the detention facility in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, be closed within a year. But it remains open nearly six years later, largely because of a difficulties figuring out what to do with the detainees who remain there. On CNN’s State of the Union Dec. 21, 2014, host Candy Crowley asked Obama if the detention facility will be closed by the end of 2015. "I’m going to be doing everything I can to close it," Obama said. "It is something that continues to inspire jihadists and extremists around the world, the fact that these folks are being held. It is contrary to our values, and it is wildly expensive. We’re spending millions for each individual there." We wondered: Are American taxpayers spending millions of dollars per year for every detainee held in Cuba? In 2002, the United States established a detention camp on the 45-acre naval base on Cuba’s south east coast to hold suspects in the war on terror. More than 750 people have been detained in total over the past 13 years, with 132 current detainees. About 2,100 people work there. So how much does it cost? For fiscal year 2014, the total cost of the Guantanamo Bay detention facility is $397 million, according to a Department of Defense report drafted for the Senate Intelligence Committee. This includes money spent on maintenance, personnel, contracted work, military commissions and Department of Defense-funded studies. Spread out among the 155 people detained over the course of 2014, that’s about $2.6 million per detainee. In 2013, with a similar-size budget but more detainees, the cost worked out to about $2.7 million per detainee. For comparison, inmates at high-security federal prisons cost about $34,000 per year on average, as of 2012. Part of the reason holding detainees at Guantanamo is so much more expensive than other prisons might be transportation costs, said Madeline Morris, a law professor and director of Duke University’s Guantanamo Defense Clinic. Most people, food and supplies have to be brought in by air, which is an enormous cost. The number of detainees is going down, but the facility may face extra costs in the future. In August 2014, the New York Times reported that an estimated $200 million in maintenance will be necessary in coming years to keep the detention facility functioning. The infrastructure was originally built to be temporary. One aspect of Guantanamo that doesn’t cost very much is the land. In 1903, then-President Theodore Roosevelt secured the area from Cuba for $2,000 a year, paid in gold -- worth about $4,085 today. The American government continues to pay the rent each year, but the Cuban government reportedly refuses to cash the checks. Our ruling Obama said, "We’re spending millions for each individual" detained at Guantanamo. The Pentagon has reported that Guantanamo’s cost comes down to about $3 million per detainee per year -- just under 100 times the average annual cost of a federal prisoner. We rate Obama’s claim True. Editor's note: After this item was published, the Pentagon provided additional information showing Guantanamo's actual costs for 2014, whereas the article previously cited projections. The article has been updated to reflect the new information, which does not affect the ruling.	None	Barack Obama	None	None	None	2014-12-21T17:46:49	2014-12-21	['Cuba']
pomt-14855	Says income tax rates under Eisenhower were as high as 90 percent.	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/nov/15/bernie-sanders/income-tax-rates-were-90-percent-under-eisenhower-/	U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., wouldn’t reveal just how high he’d raise income taxes on the rich during the Iowa presidential debate, but he guaranteed it wouldn’t be as much as it has been in the past. In order to pay for making college tuition-free for Americans, Sanders said that Wall Street owed the middle class for bailing it out during the recent financial crisis. He said he would demand "that the wealthiest people and the largest corporations, who have gotten away with murder for years, start paying their fair share." "Well, let’s get specific, how high would you go?" CBS News moderator Nancy Cordes asked. "You’ve said before you’d go above 50 percent. How high?" "We haven’t come up with an exact number yet, but it will not be as high as the number under Dwight D. Eisenhower, which was 90 percent," Sanders answered. Was the top income tax rate under Eisenhower an astronomical 90 percent? We decided to check the ledgers on that figure. Before we go further, let’s review what the marginal tax rate means. It’s the tax rate that’s applied to the last dollar earned. The U.S. tax system is based on brackets. The top marginal tax rate applies to the highest bracket. Income is taxed at higher rates as more is earned. We turned to the Tax Foundation’s federal income tax rates history, which documents figures going all the way back to 1913, when the income tax began with the ratification of the 16th Amendment. During the eight years of the Eisenhower presidency, from 1953 to 1961, the top marginal rate was 91 percent. (It was 92 percent the year he came into office.) What does it mean, though? For the duration of Eisenhower’s presidency, that rate affected individuals making $200,000 or more per year or couples making $400,000 and above per year. In 2015 dollars, that's roughly $1.7 million for an individual and $3.4 million for a couple. Today the tax brackets are adjusted for inflation, but are exceptionally lower than in Eisenhower’s day. The top rate in 2015 is 39.6 percent, applied to single people making $413,200 or more per year, or married couples filing jointly making $464,850 or more annually. If we went back to 1954, single people making the equivalent of $413,200 would be in a 72 percent tax bracket, while a couple making $464,850 would end up in a 75 percent bracket. What’s the highest income tax bracket ever put in place? In 1944-45, during World War II, couples making more than $200,000 faced an all-time high of 94 percent. Our ruling Sanders said income tax rates under Eisenhower were as high as 90 percent. A look through the records shows that top earners in the eight years of Eisenhower’s presidency paid a top income tax rate of 91 percent. It was even a bit higher before he took office. We rate Sanders’ statement True.	None	Bernie Sanders	None	None	None	2015-11-15T00:28:42	2015-11-14	['Dwight_D._Eisenhower']
pomt-08160	"This town (Wilmington, Ohio) hasn’t taken any money from the government. They don’t want any money from the government."	pants on fire!	/ohio/statements/2010/dec/03/glenn-beck/glenn-beck-paints-beleaguered-wilmington-ohio-real/	Radio host and Fox News personality Glenn Beck loves to tell a story with dramatic flair. And he’s latched onto one this holiday season that’s familiar to many Ohioans. It’s the story of Wilmington, a town of 13,000 people in Southwest Ohio that has lost about 8,600 jobs since DHL Express, it largest employer, pulled out in 2008. The job losses the small town has suffered since DHL’s departure have been the subject of presidential campaign stops, celebrity charity events and numerous media reports, including two from CBS’s vaunted 60 Minutes. In Beck’s version of the story, Wilmington is real life Bedford Falls, the fictitious town in the holiday classic, It’s a Wonderful Life. Wilmington, Beck said on his Nov. 22 radio show, is ground zero of the recession, and its people – like those in Bedford Falls -- are pulling together to save the town through self reliance and prayer. What makes the Wilmington really special, he continued, is that Wilmington refuses government assistance, a key tenet of the political philosophy he espouses on his shows. "It went from the No. 1 most up-and-coming city, and a city everybody wants to live in, to ground zero. And this town hasn’t taken any money from the government. They don’t want any money from the government," he said on the show. Beck then noted how Wilmington area churches are working together to provide food for the citizens and asking God -- not the state or federal government -- to fill its food pantries. To highlight his Wilmington story, Beck will hold a show titled "America’s First Christmas" at city’s Murphy Theatre on December 15. The proceeds will be donated to a charity in the city. "I’m going there because I think this town needs to be highlighted," he said. "I think this town is going to help the rest of the country, not the other way around." With such a large spotlight headed shining on the small town, Politifact Ohio decided to review Beck’s storyline that Wilmington shuns government assistance. We asked for Beck’s sources, but our e-mails to his producer went unanswered. So, we looked ourselves. We quickly found Beck’s story full of holes. The city of Wilmington itself has received federal assistance, including money from the federal stimulus bill that Beck often rails against. Government and social service agencies that serve residents of Wilmington and surrounding Clinton and Clark counties have received state and federal money. Development agencies and companies in Wilmington have received state aid or pledges of state aid. Unemployed residents of the town and county are receiving unemployment and other jobless benefits. Immediately after DHL announced the closing of its Wilmington air hub, elected officials at the city, state and federal levels began seeking help for DHL workers. The federal government awarded a $3.87 million national emergency grant to Ohio in November 2008 specifically to provide job training and other aid to DHL workers in Wilmington and the surrounding area. It was administered through the Ohio Department of Job and Family Services. The area has since received a second national emergency grant worth $4.1 million. Wilmington and Clinton County benefited handsomely from the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, commonly known as the stimulus bill, that was passed in February 2009. The tracking website for the stimulus program allows anybody, including Beck, to search by ZIP code to find the total money spent within the postal district. Using Wilmington’s zip code – 45177, which includes the surrounding county – the site shows that the area received $7,009,811 in stimulus money through September. The figure includes money that went to the Wilmington city schools, Clinton County Department of Jobs and Family Services and the Clinton County Community Action Group, a non-profit organization that aids the poor in in the region and provides free weatherization to residents. The city of Wilmington received a $79,231 stimulus grant to provide programs designed to prevent and control crime; a $167,392 grant for investment in rural public transit vehicles, and about $4 million to replace roads, curbs and sidewalks, typically replaced by residents. In addition, the Ohio Department of Development is extensively involved in the community. It has provided money to Clinton County Port Authority to help redevelop the Wilmington air park. It’s also offering Airborne Maintenance and Engineering Services, a new company operating at the air park, more than $5.2 million in state assistance to grow its business there. Wilmington Mayor David Raizk, who cited several other sources of federal assistance flowing to the city, said he’s chasing any government help he can get. "I’ve beat on more doors than I can count," he says. "Not because we are looking for hand out - but we are looking for a hand up. My job is to get whatever assistance I can get for the citizens here and to help create jobs for them." So where does all this leave Beck’s premise that Wilmington is a place that shuns government help? Beck took enough literary license in his holiday tale to make Frank Capra blush. His statement isn’t just false. It’s also ridiculous enough to earn a Politifact rating of Pants on Fire.

pomt-00309	Under the North American Free Trade Agreement, "we lost millions of jobs."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2018/sep/24/donald-trump/did-nafta-kill-millions-jobs-donald-trump/	In an interview with Fox News’ Sean Hannity in Las Vegas, President Donald Trump went back to a favorite rhetorical target: the North American Free Trade Agreement, or NAFTA. Trump talked about trade negotiations with Mexico and how he believes he can create a new deal that is fair for both countries. "NAFTA was a disaster. We lost thousands of plants," Trump said. "We lost millions of jobs. NAFTA was a disaster." On several occasions, we’ve looked at the tricky question of how to tally the employment impacts of the trade deal between the United States, Canada and Mexico enacted in 1994. In this case, Trump exaggerates the highest available estimate of lost jobs as a result of the deal. "We lost millions of jobs" Estimates of jobs lost from NAFTA ranges widely, but we have not seen any estimate as high as "millions." The biggest number comes from a report by the liberal Economic Policy Institute, which receives support from labor unions. A 2014 report from the group found that from 1993 to 2013, "the U.S. trade deficit with Mexico and Canada increased from $17 (billion) to $177.2 billion, displacing 851,700 U.S. jobs. All of the net jobs displaced were due to growing trade deficits with Mexico." But this isn’t the only estimate that’s been offered. And as you’ll see, the numbers vary widely. Business groups argue that trade deals actually boost employment, pointing to a 2010 report by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. The chamber found that the 14 trade deals in place in 2008 supported 5.4 million jobs, with the lion’s share of those jobs stemming from NAFTA. Assessments not aligned with either business or labor have generally suggested that the trade deal had a modest overall impact on jobs, though with certain industries — such as cars and electronics — suffering more than others. NAFTA "had particularly heavy, negative impacts on employment in the auto and parts industries, and a few others, such as electric appliances," said Robert Scott, who authored the EPI report. He added that the upper Midwest suffered disproportionately, though some of the production was moved to non-union locations in the South. The Congressional Research Service, the nonpartisan policy arm of Congress, concluded that "the net overall effect of NAFTA on the U.S. economy appears to have been relatively modest." A similar review published by the international Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development reached the same conclusion. It’s also worth noting that assigning blame for job losses is not always clear. The U.S-China Business Council and the Financial Times have argued that the loss in manufacturing jobs were not due to trade with China so much as gains in technology and productivity, as well as the result of a more sophisticated economy. And during the last year of his presidency, Bill Clinton signed legislation granting China permanent normal trade relations. From 2000 on, this had an enormous impact on trade between the two nations — and it overlaps with about half the period when analysts have tried to gauge the effect of NAFTA. This complicates any analysis of NAFTA’s specific impact. For all its faults, Scott said, NAFTA’s impact pales compared to the job losses from expanded trade with China. The Economic Policy Institute has estimated that the United States has lost 3.2 million jobs between 2001 and 2013 to trade with China, so it’s possible that Trump was conflating NAFTA and trade with China. "Trump’s intense focus on renegotiating NAFTA, and his claim that under NAFTA ‘millions of jobs were lost,’ is not only wrong, but a vast overstatement, and a misleading misstatement of the principal sources of our trade problems," Scott said. The White House did not respond to an inquiry for this article. Our ruling Trump said that under the North American Free Trade Agreement, "we lost millions of jobs." We did not find any study that estimates that NAFTA alone cost "millions" of jobs. The largest estimate is about 800,000, and other studies show smaller negative, and sometimes positive, impacts. We rate the statement False. Editor's note, Sept. 24, 2018: PolitiFact has joined an effort with other North American fact-checkers to examine statements about trade and tariffs.

pomt-08434	"We haven't yet taken out a negative ad."	pants on fire!	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/oct/18/christine-odonnell/christine-odonnell-says-she-hasnt-run-negative-ad/	The day after their nationally televised debate on CNN, Democrat Chris Coons and Republican Christine O'Donnell -- two candidates vying for an open Senate seat in Delaware -- faced off in a second live debate at a Wilmington Rotary Club meeting. During that Oct. 14, 2010, event, a questioner asked both candidates, "What qualities do you most respect and admire in your opponent?" Coons responded first, praising the civil tone of the debate, adding that O'Donnell had shown "remarkable persistence" and "passionate commitment" to the conservative cause. Then it was O'Donnell's turn. "I do respect my opponent in his ability to debate and his ability to thoughtfully answer a question," she said. "So I respect him, I respect him for standing up on the issues. But I would say that when he made the remarks about not going dirty, I do want to point out that we haven't yet taken out a negative ad. So I would ask you to stand on that pledge and ask that the negative ads, the slanderous ads against me, stop." When we saw the clip replayed on ABC's This Week with Christiane Amanpour, we were struck by O'Donnell's comment that "we haven't yet taken out a negative ad," given that we had spent the better part of a day dissecting an ad from O'Donnell that all but portrayed Coons as the protagonist in a horror movie. The minute-long ad, featuring dark visuals and spooky music, portrays Coons -- the county executive of Delaware's populous New Castle County -- as a roving psychopath that she dubs "The Taxman." Coons, the narrator intones, "is taxing everything out here." The ad -- along with an explanatory website that uses similar visuals -- was unveiled on Oct. 11, at which point it gained wide media attention due to the public fascination with the race. (O'Donnell, a tea party favorite, had come from behind in the GOP primary to beat a long-serving establishment Republican, Mike Castle, turning a likely Republican seat into a likely Democratic seat.) PolitiFact weighed in on two parts of the "TaxMan" ad on Oct. 13 -- a full day before O'Donnell's reference to not taking out negative ads in the debate. So it seemed pretty obvious to us that O'Donnell was wrong. The "TaxMan" ad was "paid for and authorized by" Friends of Christine O'Donnell, which by all indications is an offshoot of her campaign. On O'Donnell's campaign website, the "Donate Now" page says it was paid for by Friends of Christine O'Donnell. And Friends of Christine O'Donnell was also the sponsor of her famous "I'm You" ad. So when O'Donnell said that "we haven't yet taken out a negative ad," she was wrong -- and had been wrong for at least two full days. We don't necessarily think negative ads are inherently bad; campaigns are about contrasting one candidate to another, so negative ads can play a valuable role, as long as they're accurate. We're not knocking O'Donnell's use of a negative ad here; we're knocking her decision to use a negative ad and then deny that she did. We rate her claim Pants on Fire.

pomt-14840	The federal government is sending refugees to states with governors who are "Republicans, not to the Democrats."	pants on fire!	/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/nov/18/donald-trump/donald-trump-says-obama-administration-pushing-ref/	As growing numbers of governors were expressing opposition to the resettlement of Syrian refugees in their state, Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump raised the ante in an interview with conservative radio host Laura Ingraham. Trump charged that the Obama administration is deliberately trying to resettle Syrian refugees in states with Republican governors while sparing states that have Democratic governors. "They send them to the Republicans, not to the Democrats, you know, because they know the problems," Trump said on Nov. 17, 2015. "In California, you have a Democrat as a governor (Jerry Brown). In Florida, you have Rick Scott (a Republican). So you know they send them to the Republicans because you know why would we want to bother the Democrats? It's just insane. Taking these people is absolutely insanity." Is the administration sending refugees to Republican-led states but not Democratic ones? In a word, no. Syrian refugee resettlement by state Before we delve into the numbers, it’s important to note that the Republicans currently have a commanding lead in governorships -- 31 states held by the Republicans compared to just 18 held by the Democrats. (The governor of Alaska is an independent.) Given this imbalance, it would not be surprising to find Republican-led states ending up with more refugees overall than Democratic-led states. So we will look at not just the raw totals per state but also the average number of resettlements per state for each party. According to numbers compiled by the Associated Press, states with Republican governors have accepted 1,219 Syrian refugees since Jan. 1, 2015, compared to 605 for states with Democratic governors. That works out to an average of 39 refugees per Republican-led state and 34 refugees per Democratic-led state. Note that the Democratic-led states have not been spared refugees, as Trump claimed. On a per-state basis, Republican-led states have accepted more Syrian refugees so far in 2015, but not dramatically more. Indeed, only one state accepted more than 200 refugee resettlements -- California, which is led by Brown, a Democrat. We also looked at State Department data for the most recent month, October 2015. According to these numbers, Republican-led states accepted 117 Syrian refugees, while Democratic-led states accepted 70. That works out to 3.8 refugees per state for Republicans and slightly more -- 3.9 refugees per state -- with Democratic governors. So Trump is wrong that Democratic-led states are avoiding resettlement of Syrian refugees. During the most recent period, they are actually accepting more per capita than Republican states are. Who decides where refugees go? Even if Trump had been right on the numbers, experts in refugee resettlement said partisan politics plays no role in determining where refugees end up. Put simply, "the decision on refugee placement is based first on where the refugee might have family ties or other connections, and then largely on the capacity of voluntary agencies to provide case-management services," said Bill Frelick, director of the Human Rights Watch Refugee Rights Program. Mark Hetfield, the president and CEO of HIAS (originally known as the Hebrew Immigrant Aid Society), said that at the beginning of each fiscal year, the State Department works with nine national voluntary agencies -- six faith-based, three nonsectarian -- to allocate the number of refugees per agency. The nine groups are the Church World Service, the Ethiopian Community Development Council, Episcopal Migration Ministries, HIAS, the International Rescue Committee, Lutheran Immigration and Refugee Service, the United States Committee for Refugees and Immigrants, the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops’ Migration and Refugee Services, and World Relief. "The capacity at the local level is determined in consultation with local municipalities and state refugee coordinators, who are state officials, along with other community stakeholders," Hetfield said. "The states do not have veto power, but they are very much consulted in the process." Every Wednesday, Hetfield said, the nine agencies meet to decide which agency will take which newly approved refugees. Files on each refugee household approved for resettlement by the Department of Homeland Security are reviewed with an eye to the size of the household, the gender and age distribution, the educational and employment backgrounds of adult members, whether family members or friends are already living in the United States and are willing to help, and whether there are special considerations, such as a serious health problem. If an agency has a pre-existing relationship to the household -- such as having resettled other family members in the United States -- the case will typically be assigned to that agency, said Susan Martin, a professor of international migration at Georgetown University. Otherwise, the agency will attempt to allocate new refugee households according to numbers of people the agency feels capable of handling, she said. For instance, an agency will consider whether a local affiliate has adequate language resources available for the newly arrived refugees. In other words, the agency -- not the administration -- allocates the refugees to a particular city. "The administration does not try to influence the process," Hetfield said. Some states tend to get higher rates of refugee resettlement because family links are taken into account, Hetfield said. "That is why Michigan has so many refugees resettled there -- it is where Iraqis and Syrians have expressed a preference, due to family or other community links," he said. According to the AP data, Michigan has accepted 195 Syrian refugees this year. So this, and not the fact that Michigan has a Republican governor, is why the state ranks relatively high in refugee resettlement, he said. Our ruling Trump said the federal government is sending refugees to states with governors who are "Republicans, not to the Democrats." The numbers show that Democratic-led states recently received almost as many refugees as -- and by some calculations, even more refugees than -- Republican-led states on a per capita basis. Beyond that, though, Trump is wrong to say that refugees are resettled as a form of partisan political vendetta. People who have taken part in the process say that the administration leaves it up to private groups, mostly faith-based groups, to determine where refugees should go, with the decision based on family links, the availability of language resources locally and the ability of local groups to handle the new workload -- not politics.

pomt-07921	In September, the Department of Business and Consumer Services enacted a sudden 39% workers' compensation premium assessment by rule with little notice to the public.	mostly false	/oregon/statements/2011/jan/31/oregon-senate-republicans/did-oregons-worker-compensation-rate-rise-whopping/	Earlier this month, Oregon Senate Republicans called for a two-year halt on agency rule-making. The thinking is that Oregon businesses, struggling to survive the downturn, don’t need the hassle and expense of burdensome new regulations. The minority caucus gave a number of examples of state agencies trying to strangle employers, including this one: "In September, the Department of Business and Consumer Services enacted a sudden 39% workers' compensation premium assessment by rule with little notice to the public." Lots of facts to check out in that one claim. Was it indeed sudden? Did the increase amount to 39 percent? And was the public shut out of the process? In other words, was this massive insurance increase rammed down our collective throats by a heavy-handed agency gone wild? To assess that, PolitiFact Oregon delved into the wonky world of workers’ compensation. Almost all employers are required tobuy this insurance, which pays for the medical care and wages of a worker who has been hurt on the job. The Workers' Compensation Division, within the Department of Consumer and Business Services, oversees the program. In September, as it does every year, DCBS announced new insurance premium costs for 2011. The average cost of $1.48 for every $100 of payroll is the same as last year’s. (It’s an average because costs differ based on type of business.) There are three components to the cost. The largest portion -- called the "pure premium" -- is set by an outside group and the agency usually adopts its recommendation. For this year, the pure premium dropped 1.8 percent to $1.27 per $100 on average. A second, far-smaller portion pays for return-to-work and other worker-benefit programs; this rate is set by the agency and for 2011 remained unchanged at 11 cents per $100. Now, the third portion is the controversial part. The "premium assessment" pays to administer the workers’ compensation system. The agency, which sets the rate, increased the cost from 4.6 percent of premiums last year to 6.4 percent this year -- a 39 percent increase. The increase is from 7.6 cents to 10.4 cents per $100 of payroll. Republicans don’t like it because it was proposed by the agency director in September and adopted two weeks later with one public hearing. DCBS spokeswoman Lisa Morawski doesn’t dispute the two-week open comment period, but she says stakeholders had earlier notice. Also, she said that DCBS had no choice, given an ongoing decline in revenue. Senate Minority Leader Ted Ferrioli, R-John Day, acknowledged the premium they cited was indeed part of an overall figure -- but argued the size of the increase is so large it deserves to be singled out. "Anything that goes up by more than the rate of inflation is killing people who have to pay these fees," he said. "You don’t mark up cars like that; you don’t mark up groceries like that." Still, businesses actually saw no overall increase because the extra revenue from the premium assessment -- $17 million -- should balance out the reduction in pure premium. So how accurate is the statement? The numbers don’t lie. There was a 39 percent increase in the assessment portion. But the money involved is pennies on the dollar, literally: the average goes from 7.6 cents to 10.4 cents per $100. For most people unfamiliar with workers’ compensation lingo, they might think the overall rate went up 39 percent. And that’s not correct. We think the statement contains some element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression. We rate it Barely True. Comment on this item. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.

pomt-13601	Legal prescription drugs "statistically kill 100,000 people a year, (but) there are no documented deaths due to marijuana."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/aug/16/gary-johnson/gary-johnson-claims-marijuana-cant-kill-and-prescr/	Gary Johnson, the libertarian 2016 presidential candidate, recently assailed strict federal regulations on marijuana, saying that the drug causes far less harm when compared with legal drugs. Johnson was asked about the potential public health dangers of marijuana in states where it was recently legalized, during a CNN libertarian town hall on Aug. 3, 2016. He responded by arguing that the drug hasn’t actually killed anyone, and that prescription drugs are far more dangerous. "I just think that so much research and development needs to take place that hasn't taken place. And that marijuana products deal -- or compete directly with legal prescription drugs that statistically kill 100,000 people a year, and there are no documented deaths due to marijuana." Johnson later repeated the claim during an Aug. 10 interview with On Point with Tim Ashbrook, a call-in radio show. Many supporters of marijuana legalization like to say that the drug poses no grave risks to a person’s health, but how does it actually compare with prescription drugs in terms of death statistics? We decided to dive into the data to find out. Clearing up the contextual smoke One immediate problem with Johnson’s claim is that it leaves out important context about how a drug can actually kill someone. Drugs directly kill people through toxic overdoses, but they can also indirectly kill people by causing accidents. We’ll look at both cases for marijuana. (The Johnson campaign did not respond to requests for clarification.) We decided to look at direct overdose deaths first. It’s very difficult to overdose on marijuana’s active ingredient. A review study comparing the acute lethal toxicity of commonly abused drugs shows that the lethal dose for marijuana (around 15 grams or above) is at least 1,000 times greater than the effective dose (15 milligrams), or the dose required to achieve a noticeable effect. In contrast, alcohol can become lethal at only 10 times the effective dose. Additionally, the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration drug sheet for marijuana reports that no deaths from marijuana overdose have ever been recorded. However, marijuana has played an indirect role in fatalities. Experts that we talked with agreed that the drug itself doesn’t cause major acute health problems and is far safer than other medications. However, they said that it can still dangerously inhibit someone’s ability to make safe decisions. Dr. Ryan Vandrey, a researcher at Johns Hopkins University who specializes in the behavioral effects of marijuana, stressed that looking only at deaths from direct overdoses is a narrow way of examining a drug’s health effects. "Too often individuals cite that individuals haven’t died from cannabis -- I don’t think that’s true. It certainly can be argued that cannabis use has contributed to the deaths of individuals, such as due to impairment during driving," he said. Dr. Jerome Avorn, a professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School, told us, "The main risk from marijuana is from the risky or stupid things people do after using it, such as driving, rather than from any toxic effects of the substance itself, which is remarkably safe." A 2013 literature review article noted that higher levels of THC in the blood are associated with substantial driving impairment and a higher risk of accidents, especially when combined with moderate alcohol consumption. However, the authors emphasized that more research needs to be done on the issue. Other accidental deaths involve marijuana users who seemingly became out of touch with reality and took reckless actions. A report from 2015 detailed the case of a 19-year-old male who jumped off a balcony after consuming multiple servings of a marijuana cookie. The study suggests that a high enough dose of THC can result in a greater risk of "adverse psychological effects." In summary, it appears that marijuana doesn’t directly cause overdose deaths, but there are documented cases where it likely led to accidental fatalities.The exact number of marijuana-related deaths that occur annually is difficult to pin down. One more caveat: synthetic marijuana has been attributed to overdose deaths. However, the experts we talked with told us that these drugs have nothing to do with marijuana and are a completely different class of substances. How about prescription drugs? As with marijuana, Johnson was unclear about whether he was referring to only prescription drug overdoses or to all deaths associated with prescription drugs, such as though allergies or deadly complications. Deaths from prescription drug overdoses are very common in the United States. The National Institute of Drug Abuse’s website shows that approximately 25,000 people died from prescription drug overdoses in 2014. Around 19,000 of these deaths came from prescription opioid pain relievers such as methadone and oxycodone. But Johnson said that prescription drugs, "statistically kill 100,000 people every year." Where is he getting his data from? There’s a study from 1998 that showed there were over 100,000 fatal "adverse drug reactions" in hospital patients in the U.S. However, the study is 18 years old, and the National Institute for Drug Abuse told us that the study was based on invalid calculations that overestimated the number of deaths. Dr. Avorn emphasized that counting all deaths from prescription drugs is "horrendously complicated," and that estimates vary wildly. A recent article in the New York Times pointed out how the interplay between a large number of potential causes of death makes it difficult to determine how many people die from improperly administered prescription drugs or other "medical errors." Although Johnson’s claim is difficult to verify, the data show that at least tens of thousands of people do die from prescription drugs yearly. Our ruling Johnson said that marijuana competes with "legal prescription drugs that statistically kill 100,000 people a year and there are no documented deaths due to marijuana." Marijuana is far less toxic than many prescription painkillers, which kill tens of thousands of people every year. Marijuana has never killed anyone through overdose, but Johnson’s vague claim leaves out the crucial fact that marijuana has played a role in accidental deaths. And the number of prescription drug deaths isn't estimated to be as high as Johnson said. The claim is partially accurate but leaves out important context.

pomt-01773	"Having an active father makes children 98 percent more likely to graduate from college."	half-true	/florida/statements/2014/jul/29/marco-rubio/active-father-98-percent-more-likely-graduate-coll/	In defending traditional marriage, Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., said in a speech about values at Catholic University that fathers play a vital role in their children’s success. Rubio cited statistics about the number of children born to unwed mothers and what that means for their chances to climb out of poverty and go to college. After getting an education, finding a good job and getting married, "The final element of the success sequence is raising children in a married, two-parent home," Rubio said July 23, 2014. "Even in my own family, of course, I have examples of children raised by one parent who have gone on to successful lives. But we also know that having an active father makes children 98 percent more likely to graduate from college and complete the first step of the success sequence." We decided to fact-check the 98 percent statistic. Study of teenagers A spokeswoman for Rubio pointed to a research brief about the role of fathers in college success by Bradford Wilcox, a sociologist and director of the National Marriage Project at the University of Virginia. The brief was published by the conservative American Enterprise Institute where Wilcox is a visiting scholar. Wilcox used data from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health, a respected study of a representative sample of teenagers in grades 7–12 during the 1994–95 school year. The survey asked teenagers 11 questions about activities they did with their dads -- for example, whether they received homework help from them. He found that by looking at the answers, Wilcox categorized 18 percent as having fathers who were not involved. For the remainder, he divided the fathers into three groups: somewhat involved, involved, or highly involved fathers. "Compared to teens who reported that their fathers were not involved, teens with involved fathers were 98 percent more likely to graduate from college...," Wilcox wrote. Wilcox also found that involved fathers played more of a role in their children completing college if those children had mothers who completed at least high school or college. He found that only 15 percent of teens with a high-school educated mom and an uninvolved dad graduated from college, compared to 30 percent of teens with an involved dad and a high-school educated mom. Wilcox’s research wasn’t exclusively about married, biological or straight fathers; it looked at all fathers regardless of their marital status or if they lived with their children or sexual orientation. However Wilcox found that, "adolescents are much more likely to report an involved or highly involved father if their biological parents are married." Other experts weigh in We interviewed seven experts about Wilcox’s research and Rubio’s statement. Wilcox’s findings align with social conservatives, which opens him up to some scrutiny from the left. That said, the experts we interviewed raised several nonpartisan points about Wilcox’s findings. Professors noted that Wilcox’s research brief doesn’t carry the same weight as a peer-reviewed journal article. Also, they argued that Wilcox didn’t prove that fathers’ involvement caused their children to complete college -- instead he showed a correlation. Ohio State University sociologist Kristi Williams told PolitiFact that Rubio’s claim that having an active father "makes" children 98 percent more likely to graduate from college "implies a causality that Professor Wilcox's study does not establish. (He) shows a correlation but does not establish this causality." When we told Wilcox that professors raised concerns about causation, he pointed us to a paper written by other researchers in the Annual Review of Sociology about the causal effects of father absence. But that paper indicated there were studies that showed more of an effect on high school graduation. "There was weak evidence for effects on college attendance and graduation, with only one of four studies finding significant results," the paper said. Lots of studies show that father involvement is helpful only when the fathers are competent parents and maintain a good relation to the mom, married or not, said Stephanie Coontz, director of research and public education at the Council on Contemporary Families and an Evergreen State College professor. "Still, other research suggests that a better predictor of kids’ educational achievement than family structure is the mother’s education and educational aspirations for her children," Coontz told PolitiFact. "Which suggests we might want to prioritize upping that, instead of trying to marry such women off to low-income men whose chronic economic stress and insecurity very often erodes their functioning as partners and parents." The experts we interviewed didn’t dispute the concept that active fathers could play a role in their children completing college. However, they said there can be additional factors at play, especially income. "Kids from well-off families don’t have to combine work and study to the degree that poorer kids do," George Washington University professor Michael Wiseman said. "The question for Sen. Rubio should be, ‘Exactly what policies do you recommend for encouraging fathers to commit to their families and to marry the mother of their children?’ Talk about fatherhood is cheap. Ideas seem to be in short supply." Our ruling Rubio said, "Having an active father makes children 98 percent more likely to graduate from college." Rubio was citing a research brief that looked at a survey of 11 different measures of fathers’ involvement with their children and whether the children graduated from college. But when Rubio used the word "makes" he implied that having an active father causes their children to graduate from college, and the research doesn’t prove causation. Other researchers said there could be other reasons for the disparities in college graduation. Rubio’s statement requires further explanation and relies on one piece of research only.

pomt-09483	Says he "never" donates to Democrats while Paul Workman "contributes to Democrat Kirk Watson and other Democrats running against Republicans."	half-true	/texas/statements/2010/feb/26/david-sewell/sewell-says-he-doesnt-donate-democrats-workman-con/	Among three Republicans from southwest Travis County running for a seat in the Texas House, lawyer David Sewell calls himself "the true conservative." Need an indicator? In a campaign flier that hit mailboxes Feb. 22, he claims to "never" donate to Democrats while accusing his opponent, businessman Paul Workman, of padding Democratic warchests. "Paul Workman contributes to Democrat Kirk Watson and other Democrats running against Republicans," the flier states. Them's fighting words. Does Sewell have it right? Let's start with the attack on Workman. Chad Wilbanks, a consultant for the Sewell campaign, pointed us to the Texas Ethics Commission's campaign finance reports that show Workman made contributions to state Sen. Kirk Watson, former state comptroller and U.S. Senate candidate John Sharp, former Texas House Speaker Pete Laney, and state Reps. Patrick Rose and Dawnna Dukes — all Democrats. Eric Bearse, a consultant for Workman's campaign, said that in each instance, Workman gave to Democrats who had "no or nominal Republican opposition." We looked at how much Workman donated to the aforementioned Democrats and which Republicans they were running against at the time. Watson: According to campaign finance reports, Workman donated $350 to his campaign before the 2006 November election. Watson was unopposed in the Democratic primary and faced Libertarian Robert "Rock" Howard in the general elections. No Republicans joined the race, which Watson won with 80 percent of the vote. Workman donated another $250 in 2007, less than a year into Watson's four-year term. Sharp: Workman donated $200 to his campaign in 2002 before the former state comptroller lost a November bid for lieutenant governor to Republican David Dewhurst. Rose: In 2006, Workman donated $100 to Rose's campaign. Rose won re-election to his House seat with 60 percent of the vote, swamping Republican Jim Neuhaus and Libertarian Tom Gleinser. In 2008, Workman gave $250 to Rose, who went on to beat Republican Matt Young and Gleinser with 59 percent of the vote. Dukes: Workman gave $100 to her campaign in 2006. She won re-election to her House seat after winning 85 percent of the vote against Independent Richard Wedeikes. Laney: Workman donated $250 to Laney's campaign in 2000 when Laney was unopposed in November for re-election to his House seat. Clearly, Workman made donations to Democrats — Sharp and Rose — who ran against Republicans. Next, let's check Sewell's claim that he never donated to Democrats. Our search of campaign finance reports filed with the ethics commission didn't find any donations to Democrats by Sewell. Yet we found that Stahl, Bernal & Davies, the law firm where Sewell is a partner, has contributed to Democrats, notably donating at least $5,000 to Democratic judges since Sewell started working at the firm as a clerk in 1998. Among other contributions during the past decade, the firm gave $800 before the 2000 general election to Democrat Woodie Jones, who lost to Republican David Puryear for the Third Court of Appeals. Before the 2008 election, the firm gave $750 to Jones who wound up besting Republican incumbent Ken Law for a seat on the Third Court of Appeals. Wilbanks said a portion of money that the firm's partners make each year is diverted to a company account from which each partner can independently spend money on political contributions in the firm's name. "David does not support contributions to Democrats from the firm," said Wilbanks, his campaign consultant. We couldn't confirm Wilbanks' claim; the law firm declined to comment. Where does that leave us with the declarations in Sewell's mailer? Workman donated to Democratic candidates at least seven times leading up to general elections. Republicans were challenging the Workman-backed Democrats in three of the races. But Watson was never running against a Republican when he donated to Watson, as Sewell's claim implies. As for Sewell, we found no evidence that he has contributed to Democrats in his own name. Still, his firm has contributed to Democrats — running against Republicans — throughout Sewell's time there. We rate Sewell's statement as Half True.	None	David Sewell	None	None	None	2010-02-26T17:56:36	2010-02-22	['Democratic_Party_(United_States)', 'Republican_Party_(United_States)']
pomt-13109	"I have tremendous support from women."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/nov/04/donald-trump/trump-wrongly-claims-tremendous-support-women/	Donald Trump’s resurgent campaign has narrowed the polling gap between himself and Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton. In the toss-up state of Florida, Trump said people of all stripes appreciate what he has to offer. And he mentioned one group in particular. "I think I have tremendous support from women," Trump said in a Nov. 3, 2016, speech in Jacksonville, Fla. "Tremendous support." We wondered what the polls tell us about female sentiment toward the Republican candidate. Trump has garnered headlines for video of him boasting about groping women, and more than 10 women have said Trump forced himself on them. Here’s a scan of the latest polling results. The CBS News/New York Times poll from Nov. 3, 2016 found 50 percent of women back Clinton and 36 percent support Trump. In a new poll from ABC News/Washington Post, Clinton gets 52 percent of the women compared to 41 percent for Trump. The Los Angeles Times/USC poll finds women favor Clinton by an 8-point margin, 49 percent to 41 percent. The Investor’s Business Daily/TIPP election tracker also gives Clinton an edge among women by 51 percent to 38 percent. The Trump campaign cited this survey, saying it shows Trump gaining support from women. A few days earlier, Trump enjoyed the backing of 34 percent of women. The Los Angeles Times/USC poll also shows Clinton’s numbers among women slipping by a few points in recent days. However, the average across the four most recent polls shows women choosing Clinton over Trump by an 11-point margin. This is consistent with the gap pollsters have seen going back several months. How do Trump’s numbers compare to past Republican nominees? Not so well, said Christina Wolbrecht, a political scientist at the University of Notre Dame. "The exact figure depends on your data source, but the reliable sources all put the percent of women voting for GOP nominees at the low to upper 40s since 2000," Wolbrecht said. An American National Election Studies survey found women backing the Republican candidate by 44 percent in 2000 (George W. Bush), 47 percent in 2004 (Bush re-election) and 43 percent in 2008 (John McCain). According to Gallup, Mitt Romney also garnered 43 percent of the woman vote in 2012. Trump’s best number in the recent polls is 41 percent and two put him below that, at 36 and 38 percent. His average across four polls is 39 percent. Political science professor Kathleen Dolan at the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee said one sub-group of women leans toward Trump -- white women without college degrees. And he does lead among Republican women. But Dolan said that comes with a caveat. "Even among Republican women, a group he should be carrying, he only has about 79 percent of them," Dolan said. "This is compared to the 92 percent of Republican women who voted for Romney in 2012." Susan Carroll, a senior scholar at the Center for Women and Politics at Rutgers University, said, " ‘Tremendous’ is a clear exaggeration if compared with how Republican nominees have fared in the exit poll results in previous elections." Our ruling Trump said that he has "tremendous support from women." His campaign pointed to a poll that shows him gaining ground with women, but on average, he lags behind Clinton by 11 percentage points. And even the poll cited by his campaign finds he still faces a 13-point gap. His best performance shows that 41 percent of women support him, but his polling average is 39 percent, appreciably lower than the fraction that have backed previous Republican candidates. That doesn’t seem to meet the common definition of "tremendous."

pomt-03950	Says wrestling was a favorite sport of Abraham Lincoln.	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2013/feb/18/donald-rumsfeld/donald-rumsfeld-says-abraham-lincoln-loved-wrestli/	Last week's recommendation by the International Olympic Committee executive board to drop wrestling from the 2020 summer games prompted an outcry from lovers of the sport, including former Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld. The IOC has been overcome by "kumbaya" thinking and should restore wrestling to the 2020 lineup, wrote Rumsfeld in a Washington Post op-ed. Rumsfeld was a wrestler at Princeton University who tried unsuccessfully to make the U.S. Olympic squad in 1956. In making his case, Rumsfeld noted that wrestling "once was a favorite of Abraham Lincoln’s." We didn't realize the 16th president had been a wrestler, so we decided to check it out. It didn't take long: We found Lincoln was so good that he's enshrined in the National Wrestling Hall of Fame, which says he recorded only one defeat in a dozen years. Lincoln "was an impressive physical specimen, thin but wiry and muscular, strengthened by hard work in the fields and towering to a mighty 6-feet, 4-inches in height," says an article on the Hall of Fame's website. His most famous bout was against Jack Armstrong, a local bully and wrestling champion in New Salem, Ill. There are differing accounts of that bout, but the consensus is that Lincoln held his own against the "local tough." Lincoln "sure was the big buck of this lick," said one spectator. His wrestling skills were celebrated in a TV ad for Diet Mountain Dew in which Lincoln strips off his shirt during the Lincoln-Douglas debates and begins throwing people off the stage. The tagline: "FACT: Lincoln's favorite sport was wrestling." Sports Illustrated notes that Lincoln was not our only wrestling president. Other grapplers who made it to the White House include George Washington (school champ at the Reg. James Maury's Academy in Fredricksburg, Va.), Andrew Jackson, Zachary Taylor, Ulysses S. Grant, Chester A. Arthur, Theodore Roosevelt and William Taft, who "mastered a wicked move called the Flying Marc that savagely flipped an opponent to the ground." Rumsfeld said wrestling was a favorite sport of Lincoln's. We found lots of documentation of his wrestling prowess, and it's a reasonable inference to assume he enjoyed it. We rate the claim True.

pomt-01491	"Greg Abbott and his surrogates have referred to women who have been the victims of rape or incest as though somehow what they are confronting is a minor issue."	pants on fire!	/texas/statements/2014/sep/25/wendy-davis/wendy-davis-catches-fire-incorrect-claim-about-gre/	Democratic gubernatorial nominee Wendy Davis, who has been pressing Republican candidate Greg Abbott to say if he opposes abortion in all circumstances, told reporters Abbott should disavow a supporter’s comment about rape and incest. According to video posted online by KXAS-TV, NBC5 in Fort Worth, Davis said Sept. 23, 2014: "It is not acceptable that Greg Abbott and his surrogates have referred to women who have been the victims of rape or incest as though somehow what they are confronting is a minor issue. And I am calling on them to disavow those statements and to show their respect for women in this state who have undergone the horrific and heinous crimes of rape and incest and demonstrate their respect for what those situations have placed them in, the trauma that they’ve dealt with and step away from the idea that they, not these women who may be impregnated in these circumstances, somehow are in a better place of knowing how women should handle that situation." Davis, a Fort Worth state senator, was asked if Abbott should be accountable for a comment by someone who doesn’t work for him. She replied that Republican consultant Matt Mackowiak, whose comments she was questioning, has "been a surrogate voice for Greg Abbott and the Greg Abbott campaign. And I think that most telling is the fact that Greg Abbott has not come forward to disavow Matt Mackowiak’s characterization of women who have been victimized by rape and in cases of incest as though somehow they’ve suffered a minor issue." Mackowiak (who has his own Truth-O-Meter report card) took exception to Davis’ characterization of his comments and urged us to check whether whether Abbott or his "surrogates," as Davis said, referred to victims of rape or incest as if they’d experienced minor events. At issue is Mackowiak’s appearance on the Sept. 21, 2014, episode of KXAS-TV’s "Lone Star Politics" during which he and Davis advocate Matt Angle offered conflicting takes on how Abbott, the state attorney general, and Davis had fared in their first debate Sept. 19, 2014. On the show, Dallas Morning News reporter Gromer Jeffers asked Angle, "Matt, do you think Wendy Davis picked up any women voters?" "Absolutely," Angle replied, saying Abbott made it clear he plans to continue defending the state against school districts who say the funding system is unconstitutional. "And also," Angle said, "he again defended his position, his extreme position, that even in cases where women are victims of rape or incest that he would impose himself and others like him in the government to decide what they do with that pregnancy." Next, Jeffers asked Mackowiak if abortion remains a tough issue for Davis in conservative-leaning Texas. Mackowiak replied: "It is, that’s right. Wendy Davis didn’t use the word ‘abortion’ in her announcement speech when she announced for that office and that’s for that reason. Look, Wendy Davis filibustered a bill that would have outlawed, that did outlaw, late-term abortion after five months. That is the law of the land. Texas is a pro-life state. "We can get into minor issues that are 1 percent or 2 percent of the problem. But ultimately, Texas is a strongly pro-life state. Abbott would love to fight this campaign on that issue alone from here on out, but Wendy knows that that’s not strategically wise. Angle: "That’s the first time I’ve heard rape or incest called a minor issue." Mackowiak: "It’s minor in terms of the percentage of the cases, that’s all I’m saying." Angle: "A victim of rape and incest is not a minor problem." Mackowiak (nodding his head): "OK. All right. Great. Right." The day after Davis made this claim, Mackowiak emailed us a statement saying he’s not an Abbott surrogate and had never claimed to be. "I do not believe rape or incest is a minor issue and never said that," he told us. "For any victim of rape or incest, that brutal crime is a major and life-changing issue and the crime deserves to be prosecuted to the full extent of the law. Rather, I said that rape and incest are a small percentage of abortions." Abbott campaign spokeswoman Amelia Chasse told us by email that Mackowiak hasn’t been employed or paid by Abbott’s campaign. By email to our queries, Davis campaign spokesman Zac Petkanas said: "Any Republican who goes on television to do post-debate spin, uses their talking points and defends their positions is an Abbott surrogate." Petkanas said he was not aware of other Abbott surrogates making the rape-incest claim described by Davis. Our ruling Davis said Abbott and his surrogates "have referred to women who have been the victims of rape or incest as though somehow what they are confronting is a minor issue." Davis got this wrong various ways given that the individual in question, a Republican consultant who doesn’t work for Abbott, immediately clarified on the air he was saying few abortions occur after incidents of rape or incest. Also on the air, Mackowiak agreed with the Democrat criticizing him that rapes and incest aren’t minor things. Davis’ camp also identified no other people who declared incest and rapes to be minor things nor is there evidence Abbott said anything of the sort. Pants on Fire!

pomt-14743	"Since 2004, more than 2,000 suspected terrorists have legally purchased weapons in the United States."	mostly true	/california/statements/2015/dec/17/mike-thompson/data-backs-claim-watch-list-questions-linger/	Every year, millions of average Americans legally buy guns in this country. But have thousands of people on the FBI’s Terrorist Watch List also legally purchased guns, and other weapons, on U.S. soil? That’s the claim Rep. Mike Thompson, D-St. Helena, made following the terrorist attack in San Bernardino. Thompson and others in Congress called for a ban on weapons purchases by anyone on the watch list. The U.S. Senate struck down a bill that sought to accomplish that earlier this month. "Since 2004, more than 2,000 suspected terrorists have legally purchased weapons in the United States," Thompson said on floor of the House of Representatives on Dec. 7, urging passage of the bill. Was this true? We decided to fact-check the eye-opening statement. But first, we wanted to learn more about the list itself. The list, which includes the smaller No Fly List, is a database comprising information about "those known or reasonably suspected of being involved in terrorist activity," according to the FBI. National security officials consider it a key tool in preventing future attacks. Civil liberty groups and some elected leaders have called it unconstitutional, citing a lack of due process and vague standards for inclusion on the list. It’s caused headaches at airport security checkpoints for people with similar names to those on the list, including the late Sen. Ted Kennedy, D-Mass., and Rep. Tom McClintock, R-Elk Grove. The database is believed to include hundreds of thousands of individuals, including roughly 10,000 Americans. But being on the list as a "suspected terrorist" does not mean the person has a criminal record, or has ever been charged with a crime. It just means they’re "reasonably suspected" by a federal official of being involved in terrorist activity. Our Research We know it’s legal for suspected terrorists to buy weapons — specifically, guns — because that’s the right Thompson and even President Obama have said they want to take away. But how are purchases by suspected terrorists tracked? And how can anyone know for certain that "more than 2,000" have legally bought weapons over the past decade in the U.S.? Enter the FBI. The federal agency conducts instant criminal background checks on people seeking to buy firearms at licensed gun stores. In 2004, these checks began examining whether an applicant was on the terrorist watch list. Photo by Andrew Nixon/Capital Public Radio In March, the U.S. Government Accountability Office published an analysis of FBI data showing that from February 2004 through December 2014, 2,043 out of 2,233 weapons applications by people on the terrorist watch list were allowed to proceed. Nearly all applications were for firearms. Three were for explosives, all of which were approved. When we contacted Thompson’s office, a staffer pointed us to the GAO analysis to back up the congressman’s claim. The GAO found an average of about 200 successful weapons purchases by the group of people on the list, each year, during the timeframe. Experts we spoke with told us there’s no way of independently verifying information on the list, as it’s not public. They referred to the GAO analysis as the best estimate available. "I have no means of independently confirming who is a reasonable suspect even if I knew the names. I imagine this is true of most average persons. We have to go on trust," Martha Crenshaw, Stanford University political science professor and expert on terrorism, said in an email. The FBI has declined to comment on the watch list’s current size, but we found an estimate on a 2011 FBI fact-sheet that put it at 420,000 individuals. Of those, only about 8,400 were American citizens or legal residents. Current estimates of the number of people on the list -- foreign and American combined -- now hover around 700,000. A 'plausible number' Two experts who helped oversee the watch list told us the congressman’s claim of "more than 2,000" suspected terrorists legally buying weapons over 10 years is realistic. "That’s certainly a plausible number," said Martin Reardon, former chief of the FBI Terrorist Screening Center’s operations branch. The screening center maintains the watch list. Reardon, who now works for an intelligence consulting firm, estimated the number of Americans on it is currently no more than 10,000. Another expert knowledgeable about the list agreed. "Two thousand, over such a long period of time -- 10 years -- does not actually strike me as being overly large because there are a lot of people in this country that are purchasing firearms," said Timothy Edgar, who oversaw civil liberties and national intelligence issues, including the terrorist watch list, under Presidents George W. Bush and Barack Obama. "So it’s not surprising that there’s been a fairly substantial number of encounters with people who are on that terrorist watch list for one reason or another, over the past decade." The data show weapons applications, not the number of individuals making those requests. So presumably, the same person could have made multiple applications. Even so, the experts said, the number cited by Thompson could be much higher. Suspected terrorists could have legally bought weapons at gun shows, where transactions are not subject to federal background checks. Faulty list? While there’s data to back up Thompson’s claim, it’s also important to consider the accuracy of the names on the terror watch list. How do we know, for example, that the people on the list really are "suspected terrorists?" In 2009, the U.S. Department of Justice’s Office of the Inspector General released an audit that found that 35 percent of the identities on the watch list at the time were "associated with FBI cases that did not contain current international terrorism or domestic terrorism designations." Many of the records were for people who had originally "been appropriately watchlisted but should have been removed from the watchlist after the case had been closed," the audit said. The American Civil Liberties Union has repeatedly criticized what it calls the "unconstitutionally vague" standards for inclusion on the terror watch list. It repeated a call earlier this month for major reforms of the database. Edgar and Reardon both acknowledged the list is "not perfect." Edgar added, however, that many of the early problems with the list, which caused some people with the same name as a suspected terrorist to be stopped at airports, have been resolved. Even if a large chunk of the names on the list are outdated, we presume a majority truly are "suspected terrorists," based on our research and that of the experts we spoke with. Our Ruling Rep. Mike Thompson said recently on the House floor that: "Since 2004, more than 2,000 suspected terrorists have legally purchased weapons in the U.S." He backed up his claim with FBI data that show 2,043 people on the agency’s terror watch list successfully applied for weapons at licensed gun shops over the past decade. There’s no way to track how many people on the list legally bought weapons at gun shows, as those transactions aren’t subject to federal background checks. But it makes sense to assume some did. The congressman left out the fact that a federal audit in 2009 found 35 percent of the identities on the list had no ties to current terrorism cases. The audit said many of the names remained on the list when they should have been removed. But given the large size of the terror watch list — with perhaps 10,000 Americans and hundreds of thousands of foreigners — it’s reasonable to assume that 200 or more on the list made legal weapons purchases each year over the past decade.

pomt-09005	Rhode Island voters are moving away from the Democratic party to non-affiliation	false	/rhode-island/statements/2010/jul/12/anthony-gemma/gemma-says-democrat-ranks-are-thinning-voters-shed/	Anthony Gemma, one of four Democrats running for the 1st Congressional District seat being vacated by Rep. Patrick J. Kennedy, was vying for the party's endorsement on June 28 when he spoke about the percentage of registered Democrats and suggested that the party's share was declining. "What's at stake for the Democratic party in the upcoming election and beyond? Today 41 percent of Rhode Islanders are registered Democrats. Forty eight (percent) are unaffiliated. It is the common political wisdom that the trend away from the Democratic party to non-affiliation will continue and intensify. But I have the courage to be your congressman. I will lead the fight to reverse that trend, to reinvigorate [the] populism that has never left the heart of the Democratic party." It certainly seems that more voters are unwilling to sign up with a party these days. But is the trend really there? So we checked with the secretary of state's office. The numbers provided to us by spokesman Chris Barnett seem to show that Gemma misspoke a bit. He should have said that 41 percent of registered voters are registered as Democrats. Not all Rhode Islanders are registered to vote. The actual percentage as of June 18: 40.9 percent of the 701,180 registered voters are declared Democrats. Unaffiliated voters make up 48.6 percent and Republicans have 10.4 percent. (The Moderate Party had 312 registered voters, or 0.044 percent.) But we were interested in the trend. Barnett supplied numbers going back to Sept. 12, 2006. Looking at those, it's hard to see where Democrats have been losing ground. On Sept. 9, 2008, Democrats essentially made up the same percentage of voters: 40.8 percent. The percentage of unaffiliated voters was also a bit lower than today, at 48.2 percent. Two years before that, on Sept. 12, 2006, 35.2 percent of the voters declared themselves as Democrats, a significantly lower ratio. The unaffiliated made up 54.5 percent of the voting population, higher than today. So, if anything, the popularity of the state Democratic party has grown since 2006 and the share of unaffiliated voters has declined. When we asked the Gemma campaign about the claim, spokesman Ray Rickman, who served as deputy secretary of state from 2001 to 2002, said Gemma's staff was harking back to an earlier era. "Two or three of us have been around forever and we remember when 60 percent of everybody, or even higher, were Democrats and the number of unaffiliated was 12 percent, or whatever," he said. He said the campaign was unable to find earlier numbers, a problem Barnett in the secretary of state's office had also brought up. Until the last several years, "they didn't collect it because it changes almost weekly," Rickman said. "And people only wanted to know what the vote was, not what the registration was." The only way to get such numbers would be to compile historical records from all 39 municipal canvassing boards, which would be cumbersome, he said. So we dug a little deeper, and found a Providence Journal story from March 7, 2000, reporting that then-Secretary of State (and now Congressman) James Langevin tracked the number of eligible voters going back to 1970. The story included a breakdown of the 2000 numbers by party. The data: fewer than 9 percent were Republicans, 56 percent were unaffiliated (far higher than today) and 35 percent were Democrats (significantly lower than today).

pomt-04841	Says Joe Garcia "voted to raise our utility rates."	half-true	/florida/statements/2012/aug/13/gloria-romero-roses/gloria-romero-roses-says-congressional-candidate-j/	Democrats are battling in a primary to take on U.S. Rep. David Rivera, R-Miami, who remains the subject of a federal investigation into undisclosed payments from the Flagler Dog Track to his mother's company. One of the top Democratic contenders is Joe Garcia, who lost two previous congressional races, including one against Rivera in 2010. This year Garcia jumped late into the race after Democrats recruited political newcomer Gloria Romero Roses. They are the top two Democrats competing in the newly drawn District 26, a closely split Republican-Democratic district that stretches from Miami-Dade to Key West. Romero Roses attacked Garcia in a mailer: "Trading on his cozy relationship with energy lobbyists to raise tens of thousands of dollars for his failed campaigns -- after he voted to raise our utility rates." The mailer is referring to Garcia’s tenure as a commissioner from 1994 to 2000 on the Florida Public Service Commission, which regulates utilities and sets electric rates. A footnote cites multiple newspaper articles most of which overlapped with Garcia’s commissioner tenure. We wanted to check if Garcia "voted to raise our utility rates." For this claim accusing Garcia of raising utility rates, Romero Roses’ campaign sent us a list of what they said were multiple examples of rate hikes. First, some background on the Public Service Commission. The governor appoints members to the commission who must be approved by the Senate. When utilities -- electric, natural gas, water, and wastewater -- want a rate hike, they must get the commission’s approval. The commission has to set rates that allow investors an opportunity to earn a reasonable return. The commission does not set rates for publicly owned or cooperative utilities. We interviewed J.R. Kelly, the public counsel who serves as the public’s advocate for utility related matters. Kelly said he couldn’t speak to Garcia’s votes while on the commission, because Kelly started at the Office of the Public Counsel about five years ago -- many years after Garcia’s tenure ended. But he spoke to us in general about the commission. The commission usually grants some percentage of the increase that utilities seek, he said. The utilities have the burden to prove that they warrant the increase. Electrical utilities can also get an increase to pay for rising fuel costs which is separate from any rate hike on base rates. If a utility meets the burden of proof for the rate increase, "the commission is pretty much bound to approve what they are asking for." Rate increase votes We aren’t going to dissect here all the votes cited by the Romero Roses campaign. However, we did review the meeting minutes and news articles the Romero Roses campaign provided about those votes. We sent the list to Garcia’s campaign and they generally didn’t dispute the votes but raised some caveats, and we found some of our own caveats. • One vote was a fuel surcharge -- not a base rate increase: When gas prices rise, electric companies are entitled to a fuel surcharge to cover their costs, according to state law. The Tampa Bay Times wrote that millions of Floridians would see their electric bills go up between $2.67 and $4.39 a month for the typical household in 2000 that used Florida Power and Light, Tampa Electric or Florida Power Corp. The minutes show he wasn’t participating in that vote though at some point he was at the meeting. Romero Roses' campaign obtained the minutes while our factcheck was underway and agrees Garcia didn’t participate in that vote. • Many were increases only in certain areas of the state or had a limited scope. One vote in 2000 was a pilot prepaid electricity program for low-income customers designed to help them avoid service charges. A newspaper article said it would raise rates 8 percent but a commissioner described the program as "optional." The Fort Pierce News wrote that Garcia was in favor of the pilot: "That extra cost needs to be borne by those who are going to use it..." There were two votes to raise rates for City Gas Company that served Miami-Dade and Broward counties -- one was an interim increase approved in August 1996 and the other was an increase approved in October 1996. Business Wire wrote that the interim hike equaled a 4.8 percent average increase while the Miami Herald wrote the October vote would raise rates on average $2.34 a month. Customers had a temporary 4.8 percent increase and then when the increase later became permanent it went up to 5.8 percent. A 1997 vote allowed Florida Power to raise rates for 1.3 million customers by 40 cents a month for the average customer. Florida Power sought the increase to pay for a legal settlement. The commission’s vote sheet shows that Garcia voted in favor. Romero Roses’ campaign said that would have applied to the Miami area. Garcia’s campaign said it was cheaper for the customers to have the case settled and pay a small increase rather than Florida Power continue the litigation. • Not every vote was technically a vote to raise rates: The commission voted in 1995 to direct Southern State Utilities to include three additional counties in its rate hike request. The utility had planned on excluding them. The Tampa Bay Times wrote in 1996 that the impact of a rate increase would vary -- some customers would pay about $30 more a month while others would experience a decrease. The Times wrote that Southern State Utilities was the state’s largest water utility and served customers between the Panhandle and Naples. Garcia says he cut rates We sent Garcia’s campaign a list of his commission votes cited by Romero Roses. Garcia did vote in favor of raising rates while a commissioner, said his spokesman, Jeffrey Garcia. But the campaign argues those votes do not provide a full picture of his actions on the commission -- including his 1999 vote in favor of a $1 billion settlement with FPL. "At the time that was the largest decrease ever by far and it outweighed any increases that took place during the previous six years," Jeffrey Garcia said. In May 1999, the PSC unanimously voted in favor of the $1 billion settlement reached by the public counsel at the time, Jack Shreve. The settlement translated to a monthly average savings of $5 a month for three years. Joe Garcia told PolitiFact that people paid less on utility bills in 2000 when he left the commission compared to 1994. "By the time I was done, utility rates had gone down," he said. "Peoples’ phone bills had gone down. Peoples’ gas bills had gone down. Particularly in the gas and telecommunication area we opened up competition so peoples’ rates automatically went down.’" Garcia didn’t have documentation to prove that the $1 billion FPL cut washed out votes for increases, but he pointed to Miami Herald editorials in 2000 that described him as consumer friendly. "Mr. Garcia was committed to consumer protection, yet admirably even-handed in balancing the diverse, competing telecommunications interests of the region," the Miami Herald wrote in one editorial in 2000. Another 2000 Miami Herald editorial praised Garcia as the "consumer friendly" head of the commission and said he repeatedly sought legislative funding to promote a federal program to help provide poor families with telephones. State Sen. Mike Fasano, a Republican from Pasco County who long battled a water utility, said it's wrong to claim that the $1 billion cut for Florida Power and Light would wipe out other utility increases everywhere in the state. "For them to suggest let’s balance it off because he voted for a rate cut for FPL, how does that help people in Pasco County?" Fasano said, because Pasco consumers aren’t served by FPL. "It doesn’t." Our ruling Romero Roses said Joe Garcia "voted to raise our utility rates." He did take votes in favor of utility rate increases while serving on the Public Service Commission between 1994 and 2000. The role of commissioners is to review rate increases and determine if they are warranted and if so grant them. But Garcia’s tenure on the commission can’t be boiled down into a simple sentence. Some of those increases contain caveats -- for example, they were limited to only part of the state or to certain customers. Garcia also voted in favor of a $1 billion settlement for consumers who used FPL. Whether all of Garcia’s votes for increases or decreases add up to on average less or more for a consumer could vary depending on where that consumer lived at the time. We rate this claim Half True.

pomt-04975	Stimulus dollars paid for "windmills from China."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/jul/23/mitt-romney/stimulus-windmills-china-romney-ad/	In the 2010 mid-term elections, Republicans won a lot of seats by running against government spending and especially the stimulus. The Romney campaign revived that theme in an ad that asks ‘Where did all the money go?’ The answer in the ad is not subtle. Image after image of dollar bills go up in flames. "So where did the Obama stimulus money go? Windmills from China," the ad says. It also mentions cars from Finland, which we dealt with in a separate fact-check. For this one, we’ll focus on whether stimulus money paid for windmills from China. Windmills from China have something of a history when it comes to political messaging. PolitiFact looked into Sarah Palin’s claim that nearly all of the renewable energy stimulus dollars went to Chinese turbine makers. We rated that False. A version came up again this year in the Ohio federal Senate race. PolitiFact found that the Republican making the charge believed that a large wind project in Texas would have purchased 300 Chinese turbines. In fact, that project never got off the ground. The concern over foreign beneficiaries of taxpayer money is not exclusively Republican territory. Sen. Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., has raised a stir about the fraction of money for renewable energy going to foreign businesses. The Romney campaign sent us supporting documents for the ad’s claim. Among the reports and articles they cite, one refers to that massive project in Texas that was never built and will never receive stimulus money. Others stem from the Investigative Reporting Workshop, a nonprofit journalism project at American University. The Investigative Reporting Workshop’s report backs up the ad’s claim but paints a murkier picture than the Romney campaign would have you think. The author tallied $2.6 million in stimulus money going to Chinese makers of wind turbines. However, the reporter, Russ Choma, also says that none of the farms used turbines entirely built in China. Additionally, he couldn’t say for sure how much stimulus money made its way to China. "Some money definitely did, but it is safe to say more money went to creating jobs in the U.S. and Europe," he wrote. A Challenging Money Trail Federal support for renewable energy projects came through the 1603 tax credit program. So far, this program has paid out about $5.2 billion to wind farms nationwide. Once a project is on line and delivering power, that program pays money to the project developer -- as much as 30 percent of the project cost. Along the way, the developer pays the companies that provided the materials. Following the money becomes complicated because wind turbines are about as intricate as airplanes. To choose an example, let’s look at a wind farm going up in Alaska. The lead contractor is General Electric, the world’s third-largest supplier of wind turbines and an American firm. But according to the Anchorage Daily News, "The blades are made in Brazil, the units that contain the generator come from Southern California, the connecting hubs from the Florida Panhandle and the towers are made in China." This $65 million project isn’t eligible for the 1603 money until it begins producing power. When it does, it could receive as much as $20 million from Washington. More detailed information would be needed to assign those funds to the manufacturers. We called the American Wind Energy Association, an industry trade group, to see if they knew of any Chinese turbines paid for with American stimulus dollars. They said they did. Their best guess is the number is six -- five in Texas and one in Iowa. But "that might not be exactly right," said Liz Salerno, director of industry data and analysis. "Because some of the blades and towers in Texas might have come from American firms." If it is six, that represents a tiny fraction of all the turbines installed with stimulus dollars. Salerno says the program funded more than 12,000 turbine installations over three years. Chinese components might have shown up in various places, but if one is counting complete Chinese "windmills," then they account for less than 1 percent of the total. Elsewhere, we have reported that due to the limited size of the American wind energy industry, most of the stimulus money to expand wind power went to foreign companies or their American-based subsidiaries. That does not mean that every dollar left the country. Some foreign companies built manufacturing plants in the U.S., for example. That created jobs for American workers. The U.S. Energy Department estimates that the 1603 program went to projects that involved between 95,000 and 155,000 jobs. Those estimates cover all kinds of renewable energy generation work, but wind projects got over 80 percent of the funds. Manufacturing jobs in the wind industry began growing in 2005, and that trend continued through 2011. They now number about 30,000, according to the American Wind Energy Association. Our ruling Mitt Romney’s ad said that stimulus dollars paid for windmills from China. By depicting dollars going up in flames, the ad suggests that the U.S. gained nothing from the stimulus spending, and the money largely went to countries such as China. In reality, many American firms connected to the wind industry expanded during the years of the stimulus. Only a small fraction of the money spent on wind energy went to China. This statement contains a grain of truth but ignores other information. We rate it Mostly False.	None	Mitt Romney	None	None	None	2012-07-23T16:26:33	2012-07-18	['China']
pomt-06154	"Wisconsin election officials to accept Mickey Mouse, Hitler signatures" on recall petitions.	mostly false	/wisconsin/statements/2011/dec/18/maciver-institute/conservative-group-says-wisconsin-allow-mickey-mou/	The Government Accountability Board, which oversees Wisconsin elections, met Dec. 13, 2011 to discuss petitions that are being circulated to recall Republican Gov. Scott Walker. Later that day, the conservative MacIver Institute posted a video report with a provocative headline: "Wisconsin election officials to accept Mickey Mouse, Hitler signatures." Sounds daffy, even uber daffy. But similar reports appeared across the nation on sites such as Politico.com and FoxNews.com. Moreover, the Madison think tank’s video included a clip from the meeting in which Government Accountability Board members and staff talked about Disney’s most famous character and history’s most famous dictator. Would their signatures really be accepted on Walker recall petitions? A pivotal word here is accept. MacIver’s statement suggests that such signatures not only will be accepted by the state but also counted toward the more than 540,000 signatures needed to force a recall election in 2012. Indeed, the narrator in the video claimed the board had said all signatures listed with a Wisconsin address "will be counted." Two points emerged from the video’s clip of the discussion between a Government Accountability Board member and board staffers: 1. A signature with a name that does not include a Wisconsin address would automatically be stricken. A staff member noted that the name of Adolf Hitler was stricken from a petition submitted in the state Senate recalls in the summer of 2011 because the address listed was Berlin, Germany. 2. A signature bearing a name such as Mickey Mouse would not automatically be stricken if it is listed with a Wisconsin address -- but it would be "flagged" for additional review. The board has said each signature will initially be reviewed by two people -- staff members of the board or temporary workers hired to review the petitions. But, as we reported in a recent item about signing recall petitions multiple times, the board has said it will only do a general review of the names and that for a signature to be stricken it must be formally challenged by Walker. Walker and two tea party groups are assembling teams to review petitions for possible challenges. Some conservatives, however, fear it will be difficult to detect duplicate signatures and signatures for bogus but common-sounding names. (Two days after the video posting, Walker and the Republican Party of Wisconsin sued the board over its procedures, asking a judge to order the board, which is composed of six former judges, to look for and eliminate duplicate signatures, clearly fake names and illegible addresses.) We asked MacIver Institute spokesman Brian Fraley if he had evidence beyond the video to back the group’s claim. He said he did not. So, Mickey Mouse and Hitler signatures listed with an address in Wisconsin would be accepted in the sense that they would not be immediately rejected if spotted by GAB workers. But such signatures would actually be counted only if the apparently fictitious signatures went undetected -- by board workers, Walker representatives and other petition reviewers. Once detected, Walker could ask the board to strike those signatures. The board would decide the challenges at a public meeting. News reports about Mickey Mouse and Hitler signatures led the Government Accountability Board to issue a statement the next day about its process for handling "potentially fictitious" names. Two key points from the statement: 1. Recall committees have an incentive to strike fictitious names before submitting their petitions to try and ensure they have collected enough valid signatures. To be valid, a signature must be from a person who is qualified (though not necessarily registered) to vote in Wisconsin. Graeme Zielinski, spokesman for the state Democratic Party, has saidthe recall committees will strike obviously fictitious names. 2. In challenging signatures, Walker can submit evidence to back the challenges. And the Government Accountability Board can use resources such as voter registration lists in deciding whether to strike a signature. Our conclusion The MacIver Institute said "Wisconsin election officials to accept Mickey Mouse, Hitler signatures" -- suggesting such signatures would automatically be counted toward the number needed to force Walker into a recall election. For such signatures to actually be counted, they would have to pass undetected through petition circulators, the recall committees, a pair of Government Accountability Board reviewers, Walker’s representatives and other groups that review the petitions. If such signatures were found, Walker could formally challenge them to the board to get them stricken. There’s an element of truth in MacIver’s statement in that fictitious signatures listed with Wisconsin addresses would be accepted -- but only for review. The statement, however, ignores critical facts -- namely that the signatures would have to pass through several layers of review to actually be counted. That’s our definition of Mostly False.

pomt-04835	Says Mitt Romney "wants to end tax credits for wind producers."	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/aug/14/barack-obama/obama-says-romney-would-end-wind-power-tax-credits/	President Barack Obama raised concerns about the future of wind power at a campaign event in Colorado, a state that has done well with wind energy. Over 6 percent of its power comes from wind and a Danish turbine maker recently built a manufacturing plant there. But the industry is fragile and Obama played to that when he said, "At a moment when homegrown energy is creating new jobs in states like Colorado and Iowa, my opponent wants to end tax credits for wind producers." Obama was referring to Renewable Energy Production Tax Credits. The president says Mitt Romney wants to get rid of them -- and the Romney campaign agrees. A Romney spokesman, Ryan Williams, says when the tax credits expire at the end of this year, Romney has no plans to renew them. "Wind energy will thrive wherever it is economically competitive," Williams said. It's worth noting that Romney's position on the tax breaks for wind energy is a major issue within the wind power industry. These tax credits have been part of American energy policy since 1992. For every kilowatt hour of power from wind, the government gives the producer a tax credit worth 2.2 cents. If the average price of electricity is around 8.5 cents, as it was in Colorado in 2010, then the tax break can make wind power more competitive. The tax credit has come and gone over the years. Investment analyst, Aris Karcanias, managing consultant at Navigant BTM, says as the tax credit goes, so goes the wind industry. "The Production Tax Credit remains the largest driver of industry growth in the United States," Karcanias said. "And uncertainty over its renewal has historically been accompanied by repeated ‘boom and bust’ cycles of growth." The past few years have been one of the "boom" times. The National Renewable Energy Laboratory estimates that wind projects created at least 52,000 jobs between 2009 and 2011. The Congressional Research Service reports that the country will add a record 10 to 12 gigawatts of capacity by the end of 2012. After the policy runs out, new construction is expected to plummet. But the congressional analysts don’t say that extending it would necessarily lead to an upswing. They say that competition from cheap natural gas and a limited rise in the demand for power will tend to put a damper on the industry regardless of federal tax policy. Our Ruling Barack Obama said Mitt Romney plans to put an end to tax credits that benefit the wind power industry. Romney agrees. We rate the statement True.

pomt-03440	"People want the minimum wage, they want marriage equality, they want women’s health care. There’s issues that actually that really do matter, social issues that matter to the people of this state. So I know Barbara would support those issues, I know the governor hasn’t. You’ve seen the actions he’s taken on them."	mostly true	/new-jersey/statements/2013/jun/23/stephen-sweeney/steve-sweeney-claims-chris-christie-doesnt-support/	When it comes to rallying support for minimum wage, marriage equality and women’s health care, Gov. Chris Christie is very far apart from Democrats on those key issues, according to state Senate President Steve Sweeney (D-Gloucester). Sweeney emphasized the divide in a recent interview during the June 1 episode of ‘On The Record with Michael Aron’ on NJTV. "People want the minimum wage, they want marriage equality, they want women’s health care," Sweeney said. "There’s issues that actually that really do matter, social issues that matter to the people of this state. So I know Barbara would support those issues, I know the governor hasn’t. You’ve seen the actions he’s taken on them." Sweeney last week endorsed Barbara Buono, a Democratic state senator from Metuchen, in November’s gubernatorial contest with Christie. For this fact check we’re looking only at the claim that Christie doesn’t support these issues -- concerns that PolitiFact New Jersey has addressed previously. What we have determined is that while Christie sees these issues differently than Democrats, it’s not quite true that he doesn’t support them at all. Let’s look back at claims on each topic, starting with minimum wage. In January Christie vetoed a Democratic proposal raising the minimum wage from $7.25 to $8.50 an hour, with future increases tied to inflation. So he didn’t support the Democrat proposal -- but he offered an alternative that Democrats reject: phase in a $1 increase over three years and eliminate automatic hikes. Next, marriage equality. Christie, a Catholic, has said repeatedly that same-sex marriage goes against his beliefs, but has said he supports civil unions and ensuring that same-sex couples have the same legal protections as married couples. Back in February, Christie conditionally vetoed a bill legalizing same-sex marriage and suggested a referendum on gay marriage for the Nov. 5 general election. That suggestion drew fire after several lawmakers, including Sweeney, said same-sex marriage is a civil rights issue and doesn’t belong on a ballot. Finally, let’s look at where Christie stands on women’s health care. State Sen. Loretta Weinberg (D-Bergen) in May 2011 claimed that six of New Jersey’s 58 family planning centers closed after Christie stripped $7.5 million in funding for the centers from his first budget for fiscal year 2011. Representatives of those clinics previously told us that state funding cuts forced the closures. Christie has since rejected at least three efforts by the Legislature to restore the family planning funding that he cut, noting on several occasions that New Jersey residents have access to "comprehensive reproductive health care services" at other sites and the state can’t afford to "provide duplicative funding for family planning centers." The centers that closed were in rural parts of South Jersey. To recap, the governor proposed an alternative to the Democrats’ proposal on minimum wage that would mean a smaller hike for low-income earners; opposes same-sex marriage personally but suggested it be a matter for public referendum; and cut funding for women’s health care, saying family planning services were available elsewhere. "That’s 100 percent accurate in terms of the distortions and outright misrepresentations of the Governor’s positions that have been repeated over and over by the Buono campaign and its allies," Christie for Governor campaign spokesman Kevin Roberts said in an e-mail. "Unfortunately it’s not a surprising tactic from an increasingly desperate campaign that continues to fall further and further behind." Senate Democrats spokesman Chris Donnelly could not be reached for comment. Our ruling Sweeney said, "People want the minimum wage, they want marriage equality, they want women’s health care," Sweeney said during the June 1 episode of ‘On The Record with Michael Aron.’ "There’s issues that actually that really do matter, social issues that matter to the people of this state. So I know Barbara would support those issues, I know the governor hasn’t. You’ve seen the actions he’s taken on them." We’ve determined that Christie appears to support a minimum-wage hike, albeit one that is quite a bit smaller than the one supported by Democrats; opposes gay marriage, but supports civil unions and letting voters decide the matter via referendum; and cut funding for that women’s health care that closed six family planning centers in the state.

pomt-12300	There "are not cuts to Medicaid" in the GOP health care proposals.	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2017/jun/26/kellyanne-conway/does-senate-health-care-bill-cut-medicaid/	Politics and math don’t always get along, and counselor to the president Kellyanne Conway raised a common complaint about how people talk about the future of Medicaid spending under the Senate Republican health care bill. In an interview Sunday, ABC news host George Stephanopoulos brought up the bill’s projected $800 billion in Medicaid savings and asked Conway if that undermined the president’s campaign promise to spare Medicaid from cuts. "These are not cuts to Medicaid, George," Conway said on This Week on June 25. "This slows the rate for the future." Conway was weighing in on a long-running debate over what qualifies as a cut. And on one level, she has a point, we at PolitiFact found. Future savings are not always "cuts." But in the case of the GOP health care bill, there are indeed cuts that go beyond dollars spent. The math on Medicaid To first vet Conway’s statement that there are no cuts to Medicaid, we need to begin with a few basic numbers. The Congressional Budget Office estimated that under current law, from 2018 through 2026, the federal government would spend about $4.62 trillion dollars on Medicaid. For the Senate bill, the CBO estimated that total Medicaid spending would be about $770 billion less. But you can also compare how much Washington spends in 2018 — the first year a health care bill would take effect — and what it would spend in 2026. If things stay as they are, spending goes from $415 billion to $624 billion. Under the Senate Republican bill, spending goes from about $403 billion to about $460 billion. Point being, spending increases under either scenario, it just increases at a far slower rate under the Senate bill. This graph from the CBO shows the trajectories for both. The GOP changes The Senate bill takes several steps to restrain Medicaid spending. It rolls back who is eligible. Before Obamacare, Medicaid covered low-income children, pregnant women, elderly and disabled individuals, and some parents, but excluded other low-income adults. Under the Affordable Care Act, 31 states and the District of Columbia exercised the option to make Medicaid available to anyone making up to 133 percent of federal poverty. For a family of three, that would be about $27,000 a year. The Senate bill eliminates that option as of January 2018. This shuts out the Medicaid option for over 2.5 million people in states that didn’t expand eligibility. The bill also makes federal payments to expansion states less generous. Under Obamacare, Washington covers at least 90 percent of the cost of covering people in the expansion group. That’s a better deal than the regular match, which can be anywhere from 50 to about 70 percent. The Senate bill phases out the higher rate for expansion states and by 2024, the match falls back to the regular rate. The bill further ends Medicaid’s days as an open-ended promise to cover a certain percentage of a state’s costs. Instead, the bill shifts the program to a capped amount. The cap might apply on a per-person basis, or states might opt to take their money as a block grant. In either case, the amount would rise each year, but using a lower inflation factor than is used today. Rhetoric: Medicare and Medicaid It’s the specific nature of those changes that are more important than the total dollars spent. When Democrats passed the Affordable Care Act in 2010, it included less money for Medicare over the years. In a mirror image of today’s debate, Republicans, notably House Speaker Paul Ryan, accused Democrats of cutting a vital health care program for the elderly. Democrats argued back that spending increased. We did a series of fact-checks about the back-and-forth and generally rated the Republican attacks Half True. Then, Democrats reduced payment levels to health care providers. Now, Republicans propose reducing payments to states. But at least in terms of the money trends, both situations follow the same general outlines -- with one key difference: The Democrats didn’t change the eligible population, and the Republicans do. That’s a cut. Fewer people will have access to Medicaid no matter how much money is spent. Conway, in fact, highlighted the Republican goal. "Medicaid's imperative, its founding was meant to help the poor, the sick, the needy, the disabled children, some elderly women, particularly pregnant women," she said on ABC. "We are trying to get Medicaid back to its original moorings." Our ruling Conway said that Republicans are not cutting the Medicaid program. The Republican health care proposals would slow the rate at which Medicaid spending increases, but spending would still increase. However, the proposals include policy changes that will leave fewer people eligible for Medicaid. That’s a cut. Conway’s claim has an element of truth but leaves out critical facts that would give a different impression. We rate the claim Mostly False.

pomt-10003	The Employee Free Choice Act mandates the "elimination of the secret ballot."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/mar/27/arlen-specter/secret-ballots-would-be-rare-not-eliminated/	Business groups and other opponents of a bill to make union organizing easier contend that the measure would eliminate the secret ballot in union elections. This is point one from the U.S. Chamber of Commerce , which is leading the opposition. Rush Limbaugh discussed the topic on March 10 and said "you cannot vote in private" under the bill. And Sen. Arlen Specter, the Pennsylvania Republican who dealt a severe blow to the bill's prospects when he announced his opposition March 24, cited the issue as his primary concern. "On the merits, the issue which has emerged at the top of the list for me is the elimination of the secret ballot, which is the cornerstone of how contests are decided in a democratic society," Specter said on the floor of the Senate. Here's how union elections work now: Union organizers try to get employees in a particular business or unit of a business to sign cards indicating they want the union to represent them in negotiations with the employer. The employer is not permitted to see the cards before they are turned in to the National Labor Relations Board — or often even after that — or engage in any other kind of surveillance to try to discern which employees are union adherents and which are not. If more than 30 percent of the employees sign, the union can ask the National Labor Relations Board to conduct an election. If more than 50 percent sign, the employer must either accept the union or ask the board for an election. Most employers ask for an election. It takes place a few weeks later at the employer's place of business. It's a secret-ballot election and is run by the National Labor Relations Board. If a majority votes for the union, the union wins. Here's what would happen under the Employee Free Choice Act: Just like before, if unions got more than 30 percent of the employees to sign cards, they could ask for a secret-ballot election. But if they got more than 50 percent, the union would win automatically. The employer would no longer have the right to insist on a secret-ballot election and would have to negotiate with the union. "Decertification" elections, where the employees vote on whether to cease being represented by their union, are currently secret-ballot elections, and would continue to be under the Employee Free Choice Act. As a practical matter, secret-ballot elections would be far less frequent if the Employee Free Choice Act were passed. But they would still take place under certain circumstances: during decertification contests, or on the occasions where unions won the support of more than 30 percent but less than 50 percent of the employees (but unions don't generally ask for elections unless they have the support of more than half). There would also continue to be secret-ballot elections in instances where a majority of employees say they want one. That is, where more than 50 percent of the employees sign cards requesting a vote on unionization rather than cards saying they want a union to represent them. So we find Specter's claim to be Mostly True.	None	Arlen Specter	None	None	None	2009-03-27T14:02:03	2009-03-24	['None']
pomt-10094	"In April, Sen. McCain came out against helping women earn equal pay for equal work."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/oct/29/barack-obama/mccain-opposed-law-for-equal-pay-lawsuits/	In a direct appeal to women voters, a recent Obama campaign television ad features a handful of female supporters taking shots at Sen. John McCain. Borrowing from a common theme on the campaign trail, one of the women, Sherri Kimbel, calls out McCain on the issue of equal pay for women. "In April, Sen. McCain came out against helping women earn equal pay for equal work," Kimbel said. So we’re clear, McCain did not make some sort of public pronouncement in April that he is against helping women earn equal pay. To the contrary, McCain has repeatedly stated that he is for equal pay for equal work. Kimbel is referring specifically to McCain’s opposition to the Ledbetter Fair Pay Act, a law designed to make it easier for women to sue their employer over unequal pay. The law was named after Lilly Ledbetter, a former 19-year supervisor at a tire plant in Alabama who sued the company after discovering several months before her 1998 retirement that, for years, she was being paid less than her male counterparts. Ledbetter was awarded more than $3-million by a jury. But the Supreme Court overturned that judgment in March 2007, ruling 5 to 4 that a 180-day statute of limitation for her to file a lawsuit had started from the first instance of discrimination, meaning that her suit about more than a decade of discrimination was untimely. Numerous women’s rights activists decried the ruling, arguing that it was unfair to expect that a woman would know within six months after her hiring or promotion that she was getting unequal pay. A handful of like-minded officials in Congress quickly drafted legislation so that the 180-day window to file a suit could start with each new discriminatory paycheck, rather than when the person was hired or promoted. The bill passed the House but stalled in the Senate after a 56-42 vote fell short of the needed 60 votes for the legislation to proceed and overcome a filibuster. The vote came down largely along party lines, and Obama took time out of his campaign to vote for it. Republicans who opposed it argued the proposal to ease the filing deadlines would prompt a rash of lawsuits and unfairly burden companies with litigation over outdated cases. Although McCain was campaigning in New Orleans and not present for the vote, he told reporters at the time that he opposed it. "I am all in favor of pay equity for women, but this kind of legislation, as is typical of what’s being proposed by my friends on the other side of the aisle, opens us up to lawsuits for all kinds of problems," McCain said. McCain echoed that stance when Obama highlighted the legislation during the final presidential debate. "That law waived the statute of limitations, which you could have gone back 20 or 30 years," McCain said. "It was a trial lawyer’s dream." That’s not entirely accurate. The law would have started the 180-day clock on filing a discrimination lawsuit from the time "an unlawful employment practice" occurs, and would have included each time compensation is paid. The law stated that a person could seek relief including recovery of back pay for up to two years. Back in August, PolitiFact ruled on a statement from Sen. Hillary Clinton that McCain "still thinks it’s okay when women don’t earn equal pay for equal work." We ruled the statement False, noting that opposing that one bill was not the same as thinking it’s okay if women don’t get equal pay for equal work. We also noted that Clinton’s assertion was flatly contradicted by public statements McCain has made. On April 23 he said he is "all in favor of pay equity for women," then said in July, "I’m committed to making sure that there’s equal pay for equal work." The claim in the recent Obama campaign ad is more carefully worded, however. It includes a small print reference to the Ledbetter bill, and could reasonably be said to be a comment about McCain's position on that one bill. So its truth lies in the extent to which you believe MCain's position was "against helping women earn equal pay for equal work." That’s certainly the view of the National Organization for Women, which has endorsed Obama for president. Equal pay laws have been fairly stable for decades, NOW president Kim Gandy told PolitiFact, and the Ledbetter bill was the most important piece of legislation in years to gauge congressional support for it. "It’s disingenuous to say ‘I support equal pay for equal work’ but then not support any way to enforce it legally," Gandy said. The wording of the claim in the ad makes our ruling tricky. Interpreted broadly, one might be led to believe that McCain made a decision to oppose any help for women getting unequal pay. And that would be misleading, because we are only talking about McCain's opposition to a single piece of legislation that would have eased the statute of limitations for bringing a lawsuit over unequal pay — weighed against McCain's numerous pronouncements of support for equal pay for equal work. On the other hand, one could argue that the woman is simply stating an opinion about McCain's vote on the Ledbetter bill. McCain did oppose it. And one could certainly argue the bill was designed to help women get equal pay for equal work. And so we rule the statement Mostly True.

pomt-14627	"I never once asked that (Megyn Kelly) be removed" as a debate moderator.	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/jan/29/donald-trump/donald-trump-falsely-claims-he-never-once-asked-me/	If you read the news, Donald Trump’s boycott of the Fox News/Google debate is the result of his ongoing war with anchor Megyn Kelly. Trump, however, says that’s not true. He says a biting Fox News release is why he pulled the plug. "Well, I’m not a person that respects Megyn Kelly very much. I think she’s highly overrated. Other than that, I don’t care," he told CNN an hour before the debate. "I never once asked that she be removed. I don’t care about her being removed. What I didn’t like was that public relations statement where they were sort of taunting. I didn’t think it was appropriate. I didn’t think it was nice." His assertion that he "never once" asked for Kelly’s removal piqued our interest. We took a look at Trump’s public comments over the past couple of days. Contrary to what Trump said on CNN, he had been calling for Kelly’s exclusion for days before the debate and the "taunting" Fox statement. Here’s the timeline: Jan. 23: This latest chapter of the Trump-Kelly spat started when Trump voiced his disapproval a few days before the debate on Twitter. "Based on @MegynKelly's conflict of interest and bias she should not be allowed to be a moderator of the next debate," Trump tweeted Jan. 23 and made similar comments in a campaign rally in Iowa the same day, Fox responded, "Megyn Kelly has no conflict of interest. Donald Trump is just trying to build up the audience for Thursday's debate, for which we thank him." Trump repeated his position that Kelly "should recuse herself from the upcoming Fox News debate," according to Boston Globe reporter James Pindell. Jan. 24: According to New York, Trump began to threaten a boycott a day later and toy with the idea of holding his own event. "Let’s see what happens," Trump campaign manager Corey Lewandowski told the magazine. "It’s fair to say Mr. Trump is a significant ratings driver for these debates. If we aren’t on stage for some reason, they wouldn’t have the record 24 million viewers and would be back with 1-2 million people." Jan. 25: CNN’s Wolf Blitzer asked Trump if he’ll show up given his beef with Kelly. Trump gave conflicting responses but doubled down in his Kelly criticism. "I’ll see. If I think I’ll be treated unfairly, I’ll do something else," he said. "I think she’s very biased and I don’t think she can treat me fairly, but that doesn’t mean I don’t do the debate. I like doing the debates." Fox responded, "Sooner or later Donald Trump, even if he's president, is going to have to learn that he doesn't get to pick the journalists — we're very surprised he's willing to show that much fear about being questioned by Megyn Kelly." Trump’s indecision was echoed by Lewandowski, who told New York, "We haven't said he'll be there, and we haven't said he won't be there. The bottom line is Megyn Kelly shouldn't be rewarded for her media bias." Jan. 26: Two days before the debate, Trump polled his Twitter followers, asking,"Should I do the #GOPDebate?" (Of over 150,000 responses, 56 percent were "Yes.") In the tweet, Trump posted a link to an Instagram video, in which he said, "Megyn Kelly is really biased against me. She knows that, I know that., everybody knows. Do you really think she can be unbiased in a debate?" Trump also retweeted several attacks on Kelly including one that claimed, "Fox will drop Kelly if it means no Trump." Fox News released two statements in response. "We learned from a secret back channel that the Ayatollah and Putin both intend to treat Donald Trump unfairly when they meet with him if he becomes president — a nefarious source tells us that Trump has his own secret plan to replace the Cabinet with his Twitter followers to see if he should even go to those meetings," the network wrote. "Megyn Kelly is an excellent journalist, and the entire network stands behind her — she will absolutely be on the debate stage on Thursday night," Fox News CEO Roger Ailes told Mediaite. Later that night, Trump hosted a press conference announcing that his boycott and veterans rally as a response to to the network "playing games." "See, the point is with me they’re dealing with somebody that is a little different. They can’t toy with me like they toy with everybody else. So let them have their debate and let’s see how they do with their ratings," he said. "I came here to do the debate. When they sent out the wise guy press releases done a little while ago, done by some PR person along with Roger Ailes, I said ‘bye bye,’ okay?" Trump denied that he was afraid to debate, pointing out his participation and past performance, and reiterated his distaste for Kelly. "This to me isn’t a reporter. This to me is just a lightweight. Megyn Kelly shouldn’t be in the debate. I don’t care about Megyn -- when Megyn Kelly didn’t ask me a question, she made a statement last time, I thought it was inappropriate," he said. Fox, in turn, responded with another statement emphasizing Trump’s agenda against Kelly and alleging that Lewandowski had personally threatened the anchor: "We’re not sure how Iowans are going to feel about him walking away from them at the last minute, but it should be clear to the American public by now that this is rooted in one thing – Megyn Kelly, whom he has viciously attacked since August and has now spent four days demanding be removed from the debate stage." Jan. 27: Trump took to Twitter to rebut claims that Kelly was why he pulled out: "It was the childishly written & taunting PR statement by Fox that made me not do the debate, more so than lightweight reporter, @megynkelly." He emphasized to Fox’s Bill O’Reilly that it was ultimately the network’s disrespectful statements that led to his decision: "I was not treated well by Fox. They came out with this ridiculous P.R. statement, it was like drawn up by a child. And there was a taunt. And I said, you know, "How much of this do you take?" I have zero respect for Megyn Kelly. I don't think she's very good at what she does. I think she's highly overrated. And, frankly, she's the moderator, I thought her question last time was ridiculous." Our ruling Trump said, "I never once asked that (Megyn Kelly) be removed" as a debate moderator. This statement greatly downplays Trump’s comments ahead of the debate, even if his absence really had more to do with a mocking Fox News release in the end. Trump mused about skipping the debate because of Kelly for a couple days before that news release. He went so far as to say Kelly "should not be allowed" to moderate, that she "should recuse herself," and she "shouldn’t be in the debate." We rate Trump’s claim False. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/01d87b8c-fc53-4442-ab4a-fa192a82d35f	None	Donald Trump	None	None	None	2016-01-29T00:53:56	2016-01-28	['None']
pomt-08303	"Liberal out-of-state special interests are spending millions on 5 and 6 to change the way Florida draws its congressional and legislative districts."	half-true	/florida/statements/2010/oct/31/protect-your-vote/opponent-amendments-5-6-claims-liberal-out-state-d/	The group fighting a proposal to change how the state Legislature draws state and congressional district boundaries says in a new TV ad that the issue is being funded and supported largely by liberal, out-of-state special interests. Amendments 5 and 6, which will appear on the Nov. 2, 2010, ballot, seek to amend the state Constitution so that districts are compact, contiguous and rely on existing city, county and geographical boundaries. The group backing the changes, Fair Districts Florida, says the changes to the Constitution would prevent elected leaders from drawing legislative boundaries to benefit incumbents or one political party. But opponents, including the group Protect Your Vote, say the changes create standards that are impossible to meet and may actually make preserving minority representation more difficult. Instead, the opposition group — funded primarily by the Republican Party of Florida — characterizes the amendments as "designed to elect more Democrats." A new ad by the group says: "Take a close look at Amendments 5 and 6. They are a con job and a power grab. "Liberal out-of-state special interests are spending millions on 5 and 6 to change the way Florida draws its congressional and legislative districts so they can elect more liberals to support the Obama-Pelosi agenda. "More taxes, more spending, more debt, more job loss. "How can the same liberal groups that helped bring America to its knees put Florida back on its feet?" The "liberal, out of state special interests" claim is accompanied by symbols of the AFL-CIO, SEIU, the American Trial Lawyers Association, the American Civil Liberties Union, and ACORN — the Association of Community Organizations for Reform Now. Below the symbols is text that says "Spending on 5 & 6 ... $5,786,364." In this claim, we're checking that "liberal, out-of-state special interests are spending millions" supporting Amendments 5 and 6. For the record, here are official summaries of the two amendments. They are almost identical, with 5 applying to the state Legislature and 6 to Florida’s congressional districts. Amendment 5 — Legislative districts or districting plans may not be drawn to favor or disfavor an incumbent or political party. Districts shall not be drawn to deny racial or language minorities the equal opportunity to participate in the political process and elect representatives of their choice. Districts must be contiguous. Unless otherwise required, districts must be compact, as equal in population as feasible, and where feasible must make use of existing city, county and geographical boundaries. Amendment 6 — Congressional districts or districting plans may not be drawn to favor or disfavor an incumbent or political party. Districts shall not be drawn to deny racial or language minorities the equal opportunity to participate in the political process and elect representatives of their choice. Districts must be contiguous. Unless otherwise required, districts must be compact, as equal in population as feasible, and where feasible must make use of existing city, county and geographical boundaries. Through Oct. 8, Fair Districts Florida had raised $6.9 million, more than two-thirds of which came in large donations of $25,000 or more. We’re looking at contributions before Oct. 8 because new reporting Oct. 28 wasn’t taken into account for Protect Your Vote’s ad. It’s well-covered ground that "liberals" — or at least groups that traditionally support Democrats — are dominant contributors to Fair Districts Florida. The Orlando Sentinel and other news organizations characterize the issue as one of incumbents vs. those out of power, since Republicans will draw the new lines in 2012 based on fresh data from the 2010 census. Republicans also drew them 10 years ago, since they had gained control of the state Legislature after a redistricting effort led by Democrats the previous decade had been redrawn by the courts. The resulting congressional delegation had 15 Republicans and 10 Democrats even though registered Democrats outnumber Republicans in the state. The Orlando Sentinel analyzed campaign contributions and concluded in an Oct. 20 article that "Democrats and their traditional allies have provided more than $5.7 million of the $6.9 million raised by Fair Districts Florida." But what about the part of the claim that says "out of state?" Campaign contributors provide an address, so it’s easy to separate contributions inside Florida from those outside it. PolitiFact Florida removed contributions from Florida addresses (ignoring a handful of small contributions that didn’t come with an address), and came up with $2.2 million in outside funding, with large contributions from the liberal group America Votes and labor union the National Education Association. That $2.2 million is about 32 percent of Fair District Florida’s funding through Oct. 8. PolitiFact Florida also wondered about contributions from the groups whose logos appeared in the ad along with the amount "$5,786,364." How much had they contributed? We confirmed that SEIU contributed $625,000; Florida ACORN, $25,000 (back in 2007); and AFL-CIO chapters more than $18,000. But we were unable to find contributions from the American Trial Lawyers Association or the American Civil Liberties Union. We contacted Ryan Duffy of public relations firm Ron Sachs Communications, who had provided us with a link to the ad and a four-page document supporting its claims. Did the Protect Your Vote campaign also come up with $2.2 million in out-of-state contributions and zero campaign cash from the ATLA and ACLU? On the "out-of-state" question, he responded that according to Politico, America Votes had contributed $500,000 to the Florida Watch Ballot Committee, which in turn handed the money to Fair Districts Florida — making it out-of-state money that merely looked like in-state money. The same was true of a Florida Education Association donation of $500,000 after it received the same-sized donation from the National Education Association, he wrote. He added: "These findings suggest the possibility that even more money than this is being filtered through local organizations that has yet to be uncovered." Meanwhile, he acknowledged that the American Trial Lawyers Association and American Civil Liberties Union were not direct contributors to Fair Districts Florida. Rather, he said, they were included in the ad because donations from attorneys amounted to $1.2 million and 18 percent of the total contributions made to Fair Districts Florida, while the ACLU used its own money to organize rallies, distribute campaign literature, issue news releases and send out e-mail alerts in support of Amendments 5 and 6. "Thus while the ACLU does not show up as a donor, it is clear that both the Florida and national organizations have contributed numerous resources (e-mails to their mailing list, organization of rallies, promotion on their website etc) to Fair Districts Florida," Duffy wrote. What does the Truth-O-Meter make of all this? When it comes to the phrase "Liberal, out-of-state special interests are spending millions on 5 and 6," the Protect Your Vote group does reasonably well. PolitiFact Florida identifies $2.2 million in out-of-state money — though it’s not immediately possible to confirm all 230 contributions are from "liberal" donors or "special interests." Many donations come from individuals. But arguments from Duffy about the Florida Watch Ballot Committee and National Education Association hold some weight, providing an additional $1 million that fits the "out-of-state special interests" category and tipping the claim closer to true. But this claim wasn’t made in isolation: The words appeared just as five logos and a number flashed on the screen for viewers. The AFL-CIO, SEIU, American Trial Lawyers Association, American Civil Liberties Union and ACORN logos appear above text that says: "Spending on 5 & 6 ... $5,786,364." We know two of those organizations didn’t contribute directly to Fair Districts Florida, and the rest contributed less than $669,000 combined. Also, the number on the screen represents "liberal" donations to Fair Districts Florida — not just those from out of state. Anyone watching without other background could fairly conclude that nearly $5.8 million had been contributed by "liberal, out-of-state special interests," with significant contributions from the organizations on the screen. That’s simply not the case. Meanwhile, it’s not clear that the message itself came from a partisan group — the top six donations to Protect Your Vote come from the Republican Party of Florida: $750,000 as of Oct. 8, and $1.9 million since then. "Liberal, out-of-state special interests" is the claim we’re checking, and there are clearly more than $1 million in donations that fit that category, and possibly more. But the mix of group logos and dollar figures is misleading. Not all those groups contributed money directly. Those who did contributed less than $1 million combined. And the number dramatically overstates "liberal, out-of-state special interests" since it represents all "liberal" donations from both inside and outside the state. We rate this claim Half True.

pomt-11569	Georgia "has the lowest minimum wage in the country."	mostly true	/georgia/statements/2018/feb/05/stacey-evans/does-georgia-have-lowest-minimum-wage-country/	Stacey Evans, a Democrat running to be Georgia’s next governor, claims workers are at an economic disadvantage in part because of the state’s minimum wage. "I want Georgia to be the best place to work, live, and raise a family. Right now, it isn’t," Evans said on her campaign website. "Georgia is 40th in income inequality, 40th in high school graduation, and has the lowest minimum wage in the country." We wondered if Georgia in fact has the lowest minimum wage in the nation. It does, but it’s not alone (tied with Wyoming), and most of hourly wage employees are paid above the state’s minimum wage: at least $7.25, which is also the federal minimum wage. Georgia’s minimum wage and how it compares to the rest of the nation Georgia’s state law sets the minimum wage at $5.15 per hour, but the federal Fair Labor Standards Act still applies, meaning most employees are covered under the federal minimum wage of $7.25 per hour. Wyoming, which equally has a $5.15 minimum wage, also says that when the federal minimum wage is higher than the state’s, the federal minimum wage applies to most workers. "Like Georgia, Wyoming also has a $5.15 minimum wage, the lowest in the country. And while, thankfully, many Georgians are protected by a federal wage floor, many Georgians are not," said Adam Ney, research director for the Evans campaign. "The fact remains that Georgia has the lowest minimum wage in the country and that we must increase it because everybody deserves a fair day’s pay for a hard day’s work." Who doesn’t get the federal minimum wage? There are exemptions in the law for certain farm workers, seasonal workers, health aides, and workers who receive tips. In 2016, Georgia had about 2.3 million workers paid hourly rates, and 51,000 of them (or 2.2 percent) were paid below the federal minimum wage, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. An estimated 90,000, or 3.9 percent, were paid at or below the federal minimum wage. Overall, Idaho, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, and South Carolina had the highest percentages of hourly paid workers earning at or below the federal minimum wage, at or about 5 percent, BLS said. Georgia is one of seven states that have either a lower state minimum wage than the federal standard, or no state minimum wage at all, said Wesley Tharpe, research director at the left-leaning think tank Georgia Budget and Policy Institute. "In practice, the vast majority of workers in every state are subject to the federal requirement of $7.25 an hour," Tharpe said. Tipped workers, including servers, are also paid a lower hourly rate in most states including Georgia, Tharpe said. "Some evidence suggests their tips don’t always sum to get them about the required $7.25 federal rate," he said. Our ruling Evans said Georgia "has the lowest minimum wage in the country." Georgia’s minimum wage of $5.15 per hour is the lowest in the nation, but Wyoming also has the same minimum wage. Also, most of Georgia’s workers paid hourly rates earn the federal minimum of $7.25. Evans’ statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information. We rate it Mostly True.

pomt-04485	U.S. Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse "rewarded Wall Street executives with millions in bonuses."	pants on fire!	/rhode-island/statements/2012/oct/07/barry-hinckley/us-senate-candidate-barry-hinckley-says-incumbent-/	Republican Barry Hinckley's latest advertisement, released as part of his effort to unseat Democrat Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse, is a study in contrasts. The first half focuses on Hinckley with color images, pleasant music, and a message of trust, hard work and job creation. In the second half, the music turns ominous, the images are black and white, and the allegations roll like thunder. "Whitehouse voted to bail out Wall Street and then rewarded the Wall Street executives with millions in bonuses," a female narrator says. Black and red lettering gives a similar message. Here we will focus on the part about bonuses, which provoked outrage when they were disclosed. PolitiFact Ohio looked at a similar claim last spring when Josh Mandel, a Republican, accused Democrat Sen. Sherrod Brown of giving "huge bonuses" to executives, ruling it Pants on Fire. Other fact-check organizations have looked at variations on the same theme and come to similar conclusions. When we watched the Hinckley commercial, titled "Trust," it struck us right away that there was something else amiss in Hinckley’s attack on Whitehouse. The ad talks about two different actions Whitehouse supposedly took -- voting to bail out Wall Street and THEN rewarding executives. Yet the source the ad cites for both alleged actions is the same, "H.R. 1, CQ Vote #64." Both in the same vote? Hinckley campaign manager Patrick Sweeney told us that the attribution for the bailout vote was listed incorrectly. So noted. To look at the real issue, let's look at the chronology of the Wall Street bailout and the subsequent stimulus bill, in which executive bonuses were among the issues. We'll start with 2008 and legislation commonly known as the Wall Street bailout. With stocks falling, the mortgage market in chaos and talk of a run on bank investments, the Bush administration proposed spending $700 billion to stabilize financial institutions. They included the mortgage lending agencies such as Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac (which the feds took over on Sept. 6, 2008); financial institutions such as Citigroup, Goldman Sachs, and Bank of America; corporations such as Chrysler and General Motors; and one of the world's biggest insurance companies, American International Group (A.I.G). The federal government took over A.I.G. with an initial $68 billion loan, also in September 2008. More payments to A.I.G. would follow. To say that the law, known as the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008 and enacted on Oct. 3, 2008, was designed to bail out Wall Street is a fair characterization. To do that, the law set up a fund under the Troubled Asset Relief Program, known as TARP. Now let's step forward to 2009, with a new president and new Congress. H.R.1, referred to in the Hinckley ad, is the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, known to most people as the stimulus bill. It was designed to create as many jobs as quickly as possible in an attempt to stimulate an economy hobbled by the financial manipulations that led to the recession, particularly the subprime mortgage debacle. On Feb. 10, 2009, the Senate approved the bill and, in one provision, put a limit on executive bonuses. It banned any company receiving TARP money from paying bonuses to its 25 highest-paid employees. But the restriction didn't stay in. Because the House and Senate passed two different versions, a committee of Senators and House members, all Democrats, met behind closed doors to work out the differences. At the request of the White House and the Treasury Department, the language banning such bonuses was modified to allow bonus payments that had been negotiated before the law was enacted. The Obama administration, at the time, feared that a ban would be the subject of legal challenges, and might discouraging financial institutions from accepting bailout money. The stimulus was signed into law by President Obama on February 17, 2009 after mostly-party line votes in the House and Senate. Then came the brouhaha over bonuses. A.I.G., which was promised $180 billion in assistance from the federal government, announced that it had paid out $165 million in retention bonuses, including more than $1 million each to 73 employees. Almost all of them were "employees in the financial products unit responsible for creating the exotic derivatives that caused A.I.G.'s near collapse and started the government rescue to avoid a global financial crisis," according to the New York Times. Outrage ensued, fueled in part by the fact that, at the time the bonuses were awarded, the federal government owned nearly 80 percent of the company. Whitehouse, who had complained about lavish executive salaries among companies getting bailout money before the stimulus bill was approved, responded to the A.I.G. bonuses by calling on the Obama administration to "abrogate the contracts between A.I.G. and its executives under which these payments were made." Sweeney, Hinckley's campaign manager, looks at it differently. "The bonus controversy became inevitable the second that TARP passed the Senate and rescued A.I.G.," he said in an e-mail. The bonuses, he said in the e-mail, "were a predictable result of corrupt and rushed 'crisis' legislation that Whitehouse supported. If he didn't do enough research to know the likely result, it simply proves that he is a bad (out of touch?) legislator -- and THIS is our claim." But that's not the claim the commercial made, nor is it the claim we're checking here. Our ruling Barry Hinckley's commercial claims that Sheldon Whitehouse "rewarded the Wall Street executives with millions in bonuses." Whitehouse voted for the law that provided for the bailout of big financial institutions such as A.I.G. but the law did not call for any bonuses. Whitehouse subsequently voted for a stimulus bill that limited executive bonuses in companies that accepted bailout money, a provision watered down when Democrats in the House and Senate hammered out a compromise. The bailout may have given the institutions the resources to pay bonuses -- as impolitic as that was -- but in this case it was A.I.G., not the senators, that did the deed. The bailout money was never intended to provide bonuses and neither Whitehouse, nor any other member of Congress, voted to approve any bonuses. The notion that Whitehouse worked to reward anybody who caused the near-collapse of the U.S. financial system isn't just false, it's ridiculous.

pomt-11792	"‘The largest bust in U.S. history’ 412 Muslims arrested from Michigan!"	false	/punditfact/statements/2017/nov/21/freshmedianewscom/misleading-headline-says-412-michigan-muslims-bust/	Hundreds of Muslim doctors in Detroit were arrested by the federal government in a record-breaking bust, stated an article on Facebook. "The largest bust in U.S. history: 412 Muslims arrested from Michigan," stated a headline we saw in November on Fresh Media News. Facebook users flagged the post as being potentially fabricated, as part of the social network’s efforts to combat fake news. While the headline is fake, because it describes all of the suspects as Muslims from Michigan without evidence, a key element of the story is based on real events: The federal government did charge 412 people nationwide in a health care bust in July. Fresh Media News calls itself a website that provides "daily updates of the hidden things." We found no disclaimer or contact information on the website and sent a message via Facebook and did not get a reply. Similar articles ran on other websites in July. The article portrays Michigan Muslims as rampant criminals. "The state of Michigan is clearly turning into a Sharia swamp, thanks to the reckless immigration policies of Obama over the last 8 years," stated the article. Fresh Media News claims that federal officials made a bust in a $1.3 billion fraudulent scheme involving Medicare fraud, ripping off insurance companies and prescribing opioids. Some of the basic details are muddled -- the headline says the 412 suspects were from Michigan while part of the article says officials arrested 412 people nationwide. Here is what actually happened: On July 13, U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions announced the "largest health care fraud takedown operation in American history." Federal authorities charged 412 defendants across about two dozen states, including doctors, nurses and other licensed medical professionals, for their alleged participation in health care fraud schemes involving approximately $1.3 billion in false billings. Thirty-two of the defendants were from the Eastern District of Michigan. Fresh Media News cited some accurate details in the case, including that the FBI raided medical offices in Detroit’s historic Fisher building and named one of the actual Michigan defendants: Mashiyat Rashid. Prosecutors allege that Rashid ran a conspiracy starting in 2008 that involved six other defendants and various companies in which they recruited homeless people as patients and sent phony bills to Medicare, according to The Detroit News. The Detroit News described Rashid as a "Muslim businessman, who moved to the United States from Bangladesh and is a U.S. citizen." While Fresh Media News wrote without evidence that the 412 suspects were Muslims, nothing in the federal documents we reviewed, including Sessions’ remarks, mentioned the religion of the defendant. We contacted Sessions’ press office and did not get a reply. It’s not surprising that a fake news story would target Muslims in Michigan. The Muslim population has been growing in Michigan for decades and is now about 2.75 percent of the state’s population as of 2015, according to a report by Muslims for American Progress, a project by the Institute for Policy Studies and Social Understanding that aims to educate the public about Muslims. (A Pew study estimates that Muslims comprise about 1 percent of the U.S.) Michigan Muslims comprise more than 15 percent of the state’s medical doctors and more than 10 percent of the state’s pharmacists. Our ruling Fresh Media News wrote in a headline " ‘The largest bust in U.S. history’ 412 Muslims arrested in Michigan!" The federal government announced the bust of 412 people in a health care fraud scheme in July, but the suspects were from across the nation. We found no evidence that all the suspects are Muslims.

pomt-10225	Sarah Palin "got more votes running for mayor of Wasilla, Alaska, than Joe Biden got running for president of the United States."	pants on fire!	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/sep/04/mike-huckabee/hes-wrong-even-without-counting-all-the-votes/	Since being chosen as Sen. John McCain's running mate, Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin has taken some heat for her rapid rise from small-town mayor to a national election. So proponents have sought to amplify her achievements to date, which is what led former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee to say this at the Republican National Convention: "She got more votes running for the mayor of Wasilla, Alaska, than Joe Biden got running for president of the United States," Huckabee said Sept. 3, 2008. He made the same remark earlier that day to Florida Republicans at the Airport Marriott in Bloomington, Minn. Biden dropped out of the presidential race in January, after an unimpressive finish in the Jan. 3 Iowa Democratic caucuses. Because of the nature of the caucus process, which involves people gathering and regathering in groups in high school gyms and living rooms across the state to signal their candidate preferences, it is difficult, if not impossible, to get a fix on how many Iowans supported Biden. According to a Jan. 4 article in the Cedar Rapids Gazette, the Associated Press calculated "state delegate equivalent numbers" that showed Biden got perhaps 2,329 votes across the state. CNN reported essentially the same number, 2,328. It's not clear whether Huckabee was referring to Palin's 1996 election, or her re-election in 1999 — so let's use both numbers. Palin got 651 votes in Wasilla's 1996 election. She did a little better in her 1999 re-election bid, picking up 909 votes. According to Wasilla's deputy clerk, Jamie Newman, the city population now stands at 7,025. Although the precise Iowa tally isn't available, Biden's support as reported by AP and CNN exceeds Palin's 1,560-vote combined total. And it seems likely, based on those projections, that at least 910 actual Iowans supported him, which would mean that as an active candidate, Biden exceeded Palin's single most successful mayoral race. But Biden kept picking up votes even after he dropped his presidential bid. Biden got 638 votes in New Hampshire's Jan. 8 primary. On Super Tuesday in February, he got 3,788 primary votes in Barack Obama's home state of Illinois, and 4,321 primary votes in Hillary Rodham Clinton's home state of New York. If Huckabee is going to compare a small-town mayoral election to a national presidential race, then it's only fair to look beyond the single, hard-to-quantify caucus for which Biden was an active candidate. Iowa aside, his combined 8,109-vote total in Obama's and Clinton's home state primaries alone is bigger than Wasilla's entire population. Pants on Fire is our ruling.

pomt-13538	"None of the polls being conducted right now have us on the top line. None of them. It's always Trump and Clinton and then second question, third question. ... If we were included in the top line, as Johnson/Trump/Clinton, we'd be at 20 percent."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/aug/29/gary-johnson/johnson-questions-pollsters-he-tries-join-clinton-/	The only poll that matters, dealers in political cliches tell us, is the one taken on Election Day. For third party candidates, the Committee on Presidential Debates has imposed another consequential metric: they must reach 15 percent in a select set of polls if they want access to the debates and the attention and credibility that are attached. Right now, it looks like Clinton and Trump will be alone on stage come debate season. But if the polls were just conducted differently, Libertarian presidential candidate Gary Johnson has suggested he would easily meet that requirement. "None of the polls being conducted right now have us on the top line. None of them. It's always Trump and Clinton and then second question, third question, ‘Well, what if you add Johnson-Weld?’," Johnson told CNBC on August 22. In a couple of other cases Johnson specified how well he thinks he’d be doing if he were listed as an option in pollsters’ first horse-race question: 20 percent, more than enough to qualify for the debates. "I think if we were included in the top line, as Johnson/Trump/Clinton, we'd be at 20 percent. A lot of that has to do with how polarizing the two of them are. But that's the issue right now. We need to be top line on the polls," Johnson said in another CNBC interview on Aug. 11. This would be quite a swing. Theodore Roosevelt was the last third-party presidential candidate to register more than 20 percent of the vote on Election Day, running as a Bull Moose in 1912, and Ross Perot reached 18.9 percent in 1992. We decided to look at whether the polls are really being conducted the way Johnson says, and if it really has such a dramatic impact. We looked at 25 national polls conducted in July and August, chosen off of a list compiled by FiveThiryEight.com. Based on this list, we can say that Johnson is certainly wrong that every poll asks about Clinton and Trump before adding his name in a later question. Eleven of the polls we looked at -- close to half -- included Johnson in their first or only question about the presidential horse-race. None of these polls vaulted Gary Johnson to 20 percent. In fact, he did slightly worse, on average, when he was included in the first horse-race question. Johnson’s average in the 25 polls was 9 percent. When he was listed in a later horse-race question, his average performance was slightly higher than that average. In the polls where he was listed in the first or only horse-race question, Johnson did slightly worse on average. Some of his best performances -- 12 percent in polls conducted for Fox News and International Business Daily and 13 percent in a poll conducted for CNN -- were in polls that listed him in a later question. We ran Johnson’s theory by several academics who study polling. While research hasn’t been done on the specific question Johnson addresses, they told us that question order could have an effect on polling results. All of them were, however, skeptical that the effect could be as large as Johnson suggested. "It's not a totally crazy notion to think that including him in the first round versus not might affect his support. As a researcher, I would ask how big an effect that would have to be to get the kind of outcome he said. … You would have to have an effect of about 12 percent shift, which to me is just implausible," Adam Berinsky, a professor of political science at MIT. Even if there was some sort of bias introduced by the question order, it wouldn’t necessarily be in his favor. "(Trump and Clinton) have the lowest favorability ratings of presidential candidates in recent memory. So I could spin a story that would suggest if you first ask about Clinton or Trump without Johnson, you kind of prime people to think ‘I don’t really like either of these folks.’ And then you include the question with him in it, and they say, ‘Oh, there’s another option," Berinsky said. When reached for comment about this article, Johnson communications director Joe Hunter wrote in an email that, "As far as the issue of whether a third candidate is included in the first ballot test question, or added to a subsequent question, we believe it does, indeed, make a difference, and pollsters with whom we work agree." Since Johnson’s likely to appear on the ballot in all 50 states, it's worth considering why any pollster puts forward a horse-race question without including his name. Support for third party candidates tends to flag down the stretch, with many of their supporters leaving for one of the major party options. Questions that only offer those candidates allow pollsters to get a sense of how people currently registering support for third parties might break if that happens. It's worth noting that Johnson seems to be bucking this trend, according to a recent article by the polling analysts at 538. Based on current polling, 538’s polls-plus general election forecast, which adjusts for economic factors and historical trends, expects Johnson to earn a bigger percentage of the vote than any third-party candidate since Ross Perot in 1992. Our ruling Johnson said that polls ask about a straight Clinton/Trump race first, cueing them to ignore his name when it appears later. He said that including his name in the first questions pollsters asked about the horse-race could increase his support to 20 percent. Many polls do include Johnson’s name in their first horse-race poll, and Johnson does not do better in these polls. Experts say the jump Johnson is talking about is implausible. We rate the claim False. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/5b71a65b-45a3-4b7b-bb80-9222bc73ff4e	None	Gary Johnson	None	None	None	2016-08-29T12:06:39	2016-08-22	['Bill_Clinton']
pomt-03577	Says President Barack Obama’s proposed budget includes two new tax increases that would collect about $14 billion.	mostly true	/georgia/statements/2013/may/17/tom-price/price-takes-obama-task-budget-proposals/	U.S. Rep. Tom Price of Georgia has some specific concerns about President Barack Obama’s proposed budget. A post on the Roswell Republican’s Twitter page summarized his objections. "POTUS’ budget adds 2 new tax increases to IRA & 401(k) savers. A total tax increase of $14billion. #ObamaTaxHike," it read. POTUS is an acronym for president of the United States. A PolitiFact Georgia Twitter follower was skeptical about whether Price had his facts right and asked us to investigate. Price spokesman Ryan Murphy explained the congressman’s claim. Price was referring to two changes in the proposed budget. The first would require some beneficiaries of individual retirement accounts to take their inherited distributions over a five-year stretch. The second change would limit the accrual of tax-favored retirement plans. It would cap how much money people could accumulate in tax-deferred retirement accounts at $3.4 million. "The total revenue impact comes to $14.253 billion over ten years," Murphy said via email. A White House report Murphy forwarded us detailed Murphy’s claim. The report includes both proposed changes that Murphy mentioned. It also contains a table that says changing the rules for beneficiaries would bring in an additional $4.9 billion in revenue to the federal government over 10 years. By creating the cap, the chart shows the federal government would pocket an additional $9.3 billion over 10 years. Together, it’s slightly more than $14 billion, as Murphy said. The White House communications department asked us to send our questions in writing. We did so twice and did not get a response. Grover Norquist, the outspoken leader of Americans for Tax Reform, wrote about these proposed changes in a list of the top 10 tax increases in Obama’s budget. Some experts say the percentage of Americans who would be affected by these changes is small. Less than 1 percent of IRA and 401(k) account holders have more than $3 million in their portfolios, one study shows. Eric Toder, an expert at the Tax Policy Center in Washington, agreed these changes would affect a small number of Americans. Toder said by limiting the beneficiary withdrawals to just five years, "you are going to be paying more taxes." Tax experts say the five-year requirement makes recipients withdraw a larger sum of money, but it could also put that person into a higher tax bracket and make him pay more in income taxes. Currently, there’s no limit on how much you can accumulate in a retirement account. If approved, investors would have to put more money in taxable accounts once they exceed the limit, Forbes.com says. Toder said there’s been some discussion on Capitol Hill about limiting the accrual, but he doesn’t think there’s much interest in Congress to make either one of these changes. Still, is it accurate to label these as tax increases since they’re not typical changes in a tax rate? Toder compared it to changing the mortgage interest deduction on income taxes, an idea that was discussed during last year’s presidential race. For homeowners, he said, such a change would be a tax increase. "Technically, they are tax increases," he said of the proposed changes. William McBride, the chief economist at the nonpartisan Tax Foundation in Washington, agreed with Price’s assessment. "Yes, these count as increases," McBride said via email. To sum up, Price claimed on Twitter that the president’s budget includes two new tax increases that would total $14 billion. The changes could add that much money to Uncle Sam’s coffers over a 10-year period. Calling them tax increases is a matter of semantics. That could imply it would affect large numbers of people who got Price’s tweet. The changes would affect a very small percentage of account holders, studies show. That’s important context that is missing. We rate Price’s claim Mostly True.	None	Tom Price	None	None	None	2013-05-17T06:00:00	2013-05-01	['None']
pomt-06646	Says "Rick Perry doubled spending in a decade."	mostly false	/texas/statements/2011/sep/14/keep-conservatives-united/pro-bachmann-group-says-texas-spending-has-doubled/	A group favoring U.S. Rep. Michele Bachmann of Minnesota for president posted an ad online this month suggesting Gov. Rick Perry, the leading hopeful for the Republican presidential nomination, isn’t a fiscal conservative. In the spot, targeted at South Carolina voters, the narrator says Perry "doubled state spending in a decade." That claim by the Keep Conservatives United super PAC immediately rang a bell with us. In August 2010, Texas Democratic gubernatorial nominee Bill White said the state budget had gone up over 80 percent under Perry, the governor since late 2000. We rated White’s statement Mostly True. Between 2000-01 and 2010-11, spending from all sources including federal and local aid increased nearly 79 percent, from nearly $101.8 billion to almost $182.2 billion. Then again, we noted, there are ways to analyze the increase that whittle the growth percentage. Adjusted for population growth and inflation, spending increased 18.2 percent over the period. Also, expenditures of state general revenue — the money most directly influenced by legislators and the governor — decreased by 4.5 percent, according to the state’s advisory Legislative Budget Board. The pro-Bachmann group offers as backup for its claim data from two comprehensive annual financial reports issued by the Texas state comptroller’s office which account for state finances in accord with standards set by the Governmental Accounting Standards Board. Counting spending from general revenue (basically state tax dollars), special revenue (meaning income restricted to specific programs), capital projects and debt service, the reports show spending of nearly $45 billion in the fiscal year that ended Aug. 31, 2000, and $90.4 billion in the year that ended Aug. 31, 2010, — an increase of nearly 101 percent. So, there’s a way to stake the "doubling" claim. We wondered how spending looks based on the actual state budgets adopted on Perry’s watch. At our inquiry, budget board staff provided revised figures for 2000 through 2010 and added information from the 2011 budget year and 2012-13 state budget that Perry signed into law in June. Interestingly, the 2000-01 and 2010-11 expenditures from all sources have changed since our 2010 fact check; the updated figures indicate an 86 percent increase in raw spending over the period, which drops to 22 percent if adjusted for population growth and inflation. Between 2000 and 2010, the years singled out by the pro-Bachmann group, spending from all sources increased 86 percent, or 21 percent adjusted for inflation and population growth, according to the board’s figures. Spending from state general revenue rose 44 percent, though that was actually down 6 percent in 2010 from 2000 when adjusted for inflation and population growth — as noted in a Sept. 1, 2011, Perry campaign email challenging the ad. When we delved into spending growth for our 2010 fact check, Dale Craymer, president of the Texas Taxpayers and Research Association, suggested that any comparison of the 2000-01 budget and the 2010-11 budget take into account two factors in the latter budget that weren't at play in 2000-01. First, Perry and state lawmakers agreed several years ago to cover reductions in school property taxes with state revenue; that's costing $14 billion in the 2010-11 budget. Craymer said that commitment doesn't translate to an increase in government spending; it's a shift in which level of government is doing the spending. Second, the 2010-11 budget included about $12 billion in one-time federal stimulus aid. Remove the combined $26 billion out of the comparison and the state budget increase since 2000-01 falls to 53 percent. In a recent follow-up interview, Craymer stuck with his 2010 caveats. He also cautioned against reaching conclusions based on the state’s annual financial reports which, he said, have to account for far more than actual spending in a fiscal year. He said the best source for comparisons of spending under any governor would be the state budgets they signed into law as tracked by the budget board. In an interview, Billy Hamilton, the state’s former deputy comptroller, aired a similar view, noting that major debt decisions reflected in the financial reports were approved directly by voters in amendments to the state constitution. Those reach the ballot without the governor having a say. Researcher Bob Harris, the pro-Bachmann group’s treasurer, told us in an interview: "I wanted to get the whole picture ... This was the comprehensive report." R.J. DeSilva, spokesman for the comptroller’s office, said by email the report each year "aggregates the state's assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and presents a broader accounting scope that includes more than the allocation of general revenue funds through the state's budgeting process. For example, accounting principles dictate the depreciation of a state vehicle has to be shown as part of expenses in the (report), although it is non-cash activity which is not included in the budget process." Asked to elaborate, DeSilva replied: "Another example would be higher-education spending of local funds (like tuition revenue). That spending is included in the (report), but it’s not part of budget appropriations by the Legislature." All told, we can see the appeal of using a financial report with "comprehensive" in its title. And the financial reports, piling in all kinds of spending factors, seemingly back up the "doubling" claim. However, we’re not convinced the reports are the best way to check spending under gubernatorial sway. It’s why we tend to hew to figures in the state’s budgets. And according to the latest updates of budgeted spending, spending from all sources increased 86 percent over the years analyzed by the group, 21 percent once population growth and inflation are counted. Budgeted spending the governormost affected, of state general revenue, went up 44 percent, though that decreased 6 percent once inflation and population growth are weighed. We rate the statement Mostly False.	None	Keep Conservatives United	None	None	None	2011-09-14T15:38:26	2011-09-01	['None']
pomt-03953	The United States does "not have a system through which growers and dairies can bring a workforce legally into the U.S."	mostly false	/florida/statements/2013/feb/18/marco-rubio/marco-rubio-says-us-farmers-have-no-way-bring-work/	Sen. Marco Rubio says that one of the reasons we need immigration reform is to help farmers who don’t have a way to legally hire workers. Rubio, R-Fla., and a bipartisan group of senators have put forward a major proposal on immigration, and Rubio has been defending it to conservative audiences, including in a Jan. 30 column on RedState.com. Rubio wrote that the country needs "a stable and affordable domestic supply of food. ... Agriculture has always required a significant workforce from abroad, but we do not have a system through which growers and dairies can bring a workforce legally into the U.S." Rubio called for a "modernized agricultural worker program" that "allows our growers to contract the seasonal and year round labor they need legally." In a related fact-check, we explored his broad claim that "Agriculture has always required a significant workforce from abroad." Here we research whether the U.S. has a system for farmers to legally import foreign workers. The H-2A seasonal visa process The United States does have a system to allow farmers to hire seasonal workers. It’s called the H-2A visa program. But the H-2A visa program has several restrictions and has been widely criticized as inadequate. We turned to a 2013 Congressional Research Service report to explain the process. Farmers apply for certification from the Labor Department to ensure that U.S. workers are not available; the majority of these requests are granted. (Florida ranks fifth for the number of granted certifications.) Employers then submit a petition to the Department of Homeland Security to bring in foreign workers. If that application is approved, foreign workers can go to a U.S. embassy or consulate and apply for the visa from the State Department. Employers must meet a list of requirements, including providing workers with housing, transportation, and other benefits, such as workers’ compensation insurance. No health insurance coverage is required. The number of H-2A visas have soared from about 6,500 in 1992 to a high of about 64,400 in 2008. There were about 55,400 H-2A visas issued in 2011, based on preliminary data. However, despite that growth, the program is small relative to total farm employment. For example in 2007, (the most recent Census of Agriculture from the USDA) there were about 2.6 million hired farm workers and about 50,800 H-2A visas granted. "Critics of the H-2A program cite the low levels of participation as evidence of the program’s inadequacy to meet the needs of U.S. agricultural employers," the Congressional Research Service said. "Others, however, attribute the program’s low utilization to the availability of unauthorized workers, who are willing to work for lower wages than legal workers." Many farm groups and a bipartisan group of senators, including Sen. Bill Nelson, D-Fla., have complained that the process is too difficult and doesn't provide enough workers. The program requires that workers be temporary or seasonal. Many agriculture jobs -- for example livestock or dairy farms -- require year-round labor, and a coalition of farm groups is pushing for an 11-month a year guest worker program. "There is a legal program," said Debby Wechsler, executive secretary of the North Carolina Strawberry Association. "It is considered by agriculture to be broken and needing to be fixed. Rubio is definitely wrong when he says there is no program now, but he is right when he says something needs to be done." Ervin Lineberger, who owns a North Carolina blackberry and grape farm, told PolitiFact that he looked into using the H-2A program a couple of times and concluded that it wouldn’t work for him. One problem was that he would have to supply housing, and he only does that now for four workers, though he hires 50 -- mostly Mexicans -- during the season. Last year he turned to unemployed U.S. citizens, and of the 15 he hired, "only one was with me when we finished the season." Some were too out of shape for the farm work or didn’t want to work on weekends, he said. "There is a need for a process where, especially the Mexican workers, can come here legally and go home legally," he said. Steve Camarota, director of research for the Center for Immigration Studies, which calls for low-immigration, said that the H-2A program works well for some and not others. "The key question is, are farmers so used to paying low wages for long hours that it is the H-2A worker protections they don't like, or is the program really too cumbersome? One reason to be skeptical of farmers claims of not enough workers is that there has seldom been a time when they had enough workers, at least from their point of view." Camarota questions the claim of a labor shortage because he says if that was the case, wages would be rising more rapidly. We asked Rubio to explain his claim, since there is a legal system for at least some farmers to bring in foreign workers. A spokeswoman pointed us to the data showing the small number of farm workers who get the H-2A visa. She also cited a report done for the Migration Policy Institute which raised concerns about the future supply of farm labor and noted the bureaucratic hassles in the H-2A process. While farm owners complain the visa program is "broken and bureaucratic," the paper stated, some worker advocates say that farmers are bypassing U.S. workers. Our ruling Rubio said the United States does "not have a system through which growers and dairies can bring a workforce legally into the U.S." There actually is a system for growers to legally hire foreign workers, so Rubio is wrong on this basic point. However, many farmers have complained that the visa program is inadequate, cumbersome and in dire need of a makeover. Also, the H-2A visa program is only for temporary seasonal labor. Rubio specifically mentioned dairies, and that is a type of farm that needs year-round workers. We rate his claim Mostly False.

Harry Reid may be the Democratic Senate majority leader, but that doesn't mean he's a shoo-in for re-election in 2012. In fact, several potential Republican candidates outperform Reid in recent polls, suggesting Nevada voters are none too pleased with Reid. Republicans are vying against each other to challenge Reid, and the primary appears to have several front-runners: Sue Lowden, a casino executive and former state party chairperson; Danny Tarkanian, a businessman and former college basketball star; and Sharron Angle, a former state representative with support from the Tea Party Express, a national group associated with the movement. The Republican primary is set for June 8. The ads we've reviewed from the primary contest have similar themes: Government is too big, Washington can't be trusted, and only a true conservative should get the Republican nomination. Tarkanian's ad "Insiders' Game" sounds these themes in fairly dramatic fashion, using ominous music and flashy graphics, and manages to attack Lowden and Reid simultaneously. "Washington power was always Harry Reid's dream. That's why he needed to be stopped. Sue Lowden? She helped Harry Reid rise to power." Lowden is then shown in a video clip, saying, "I supported Harry Reid early on." "Sue Lowden gave Harry Reid's campaigns a thousand dollars in five different elections, helping his Senate dreams come true. Today Harry Reid's got his power, and Sue Lowden's worth millions. It's always an insiders' game," the ad concludes. We couldn't get a response to our questions from the Lowden campaign, but we did call the Federal Election Commission to find out about Lowden's contributions. She did donate to Harry Reid -- back in the 1980s. She gave him $2,000 in 1984, $1,000 in 1986, and $2,000 in 1989. The ad counts that as "five different elections," because in 1984 and 1989, Lowden made donations of $1,000 each for the primary and the general. Her husband, casino executive Paul Lowden, also contributed $8,000 between 1982 and 1995. She told the Nevada media that she and her husband supported Reid at one time, but not anymore. "Early on in the '80s when he was independent, we did feel that he was representing Nevada," she said last year. The ad implies -- but doesn't say explicitly -- that Lowden benefited from her support of Reid. The Tarkanian campaign points to a letter of recommendation that Reid wrote to the Illinois Gaming Board in 1992, expressing support for the Lowdens' casino operations, describing Reid's interactions with them during his time as chairman of the Nevada Gaming Commission from 1977 to 1981. "I have found them to be great assets to the state, and I have found them to be honest in all their dealings with me. I highly recommend Paul Lowden and his company," Reid wrote. (You can read the letter via the Las Vegas Sun website.) Jon Ralston, a reporter and commentator on Nevada politics, pointed out in his own analysis of the ad that the Lowdens were wealthy before contributing to Reid's campaign, and that Reid raised plenty of money from other people. Here, we're checking the statement from the Tarkanian campaign, that "Sue Lowden gave Harry Reid's campaigns a thousand dollars in five different elections, helping his Senate dreams come true." The campaign is counting primary and general election contributions as donations for separate elections. You could argue that this was actually support for three elections, not five. The ad also implies that this support helped Reid's "rise to power," and obliquely hints that there was some sort of mutual benefit. There's not much in the record to support that. Still, because the statement we're checking here is about Lowden's campaign contributions, which are a matter of public record, we're rating this Mostly True.

pomt-01091	"I belong to the AFL-CIO."	true	/texas/statements/2015/jan/13/rick-perry/rick-perry-i-belong-afl-cio/	Suggesting Republicans should reach out to traditionally resistant voters such as union members, departing Texas Gov. Rick Perry declared himself a union member during a "policy orientation" held in Austin before the 2015 Texas legislative session. Perry, appearing with former House Speaker Newt Gingrich at the Jan. 9, 2015, gathering hosted by the conservative Texas Public Policy Foundation, eased toward his declaration by saying the Teamsters union had supported him for governor. Reaching out to it would work, he said, "not because I’m a dyed-in-the-wool AFL-CIO member -- which I am." Perry then addressed a mentor in the audience, former Sen. Phil Gramm, R-Texas, saying: "You didn’t know that, did you?" Amid laughter, Perry went on: "Not only did I used to be a Democrat, senator, I belong to the AFL-CIO. Got the card in my pocket," Perry said, acting as if to reach for it, "and they probably hate it that I pay my dues every quarter." Ed Sills, spokesman for the Texas AFL-CIO, commented on Perry’s declaration in the union’s email news distributed later the same day, writing: "If any reader of this newsletter wants to own up to Perry's membership in their union, please send word. "But I kid," Sills wrote. "The more, the merrier. The labor movement wants to be a big tent and we do proudly represent a minority of Republican members, many of them of the rock-ribbed, partisan variety. The AFL-CIO does not have a loyalty test." Like Sills, we wondered if Perry, who entered politics as a Democratic Texas House member before switching parties and winning his first statewide race (for agriculture commissioner) in 1990, is a union member. To our inquiry, gubernatorial spokesman Felix Browne pointed out by email the Dallas Morning News described Perry’s membership in a Feb. 22, 2010, news story. That story said: "The governor became a member of the Screen Actors Guild after he appeared in the Tommy Lee Jones movie Man of the House. In the movie, he played the governor of Texas." The day after Perry mentioned the membership, Breitbart.com, the conservative news site, quoted a former Perry aide, Kris Heckmann, saying Perry continued to pay his union dues after the making of the 2005 movie. At our request, Browne provided a photo of Perry’s membership card for the SAG-American Federation of Television and Radio Artists, which we edited for this photo solely to remove his membership number: A web page on the union’s history says the union, bringing together the guild and AFTRA, has about 160,000 members. "A proud member of the AFL-CIO, SAG-AFTRA partners with our fellow unions in the U.S. and internationally to seek the strongest protections for media artists throughout the world," the page says. A SAG-AFTRA spokeswoman, Pamela Greenwalt, told us by phone the union does not reveal whether anyone is a member. Footnote: Sills said in his item on Perry’s announcement that as governor, Perry had not been a backer of Texas AFL-CIO policies. "He has opposed a minimum-wage increase, has rejected on ideological grounds tens of billions of dollars in federal funds that would expand Medicaid coverage, has chipped away at the ability of laid-off workers to receive Unemployment Insurance benefits, and has presided over a public school system that a state judge found to be unconstitutionally inadequate," Sills wrote. Our ruling Perry said he’s a member of the AFL-CIO. Since 2006, Perry has been a member of the Screen Actors Guild, which is part of the AFL-CIO. We rate his claim True.

pomt-06493	"The Tax Foundation figures Rhode Island as the 10th highest state for state and local tax burden per capita in the country. We're the 6th worst in the country for the business tax index. We're the 3rd highest per capita in the country for all taxes."	mostly false	/rhode-island/statements/2011/oct/14/peter-palumbo/ri-rep-peter-palumbo-misses-marks-when-reporting-w/	It's widely known that Rhode Island doesn't rank well in national comparisons showing how much residents pay in taxes. During an Oct. 5, 2011, rally protesting Gov. Lincoln Chafee’s positions on illegal immigration, state Rep. Peter Palumbo cited the rankings of one research group to argue that Chafee should be focusing instead on tax issues. (The rally followed a decision by the state Board of Governors for Higher Education making undocumented Rhode Island students eligible for in-state tuition at the state’s colleges and university, a policy Chafee supported. Chafee has also raised the possibility of creating a driver’s license for undocumented immigrants.) "The Tax Foundation figures Rhode Island as the 10th highest state for state and local tax burden per capita in the country," Palumbo told the crowd of about 500. "We're the sixth worst in the country for the business tax index. We're the third highest per capita in the country for all taxes." We wondered whether the rankings are really that poor. The Tax Foundation is a nonpartisan, business-backed tax policy group based in Washington, D.C. It regularly ranks states on various tax issues. Their reports can be seen at TaxFoundation.org, where we found the latest numbers. Let's break them down. State and local tax burden: The latest study, compiled from 2009 data and released in February 2011, ranks Rhode Island as the fifth worst in the country, not the 10th, as Palumbo told the crowd. By the Foundation's assessment, things are even worse than he asserted. Business tax index: This is actually the "State Business Tax Climate Index," in which the foundation uses various measures to come up with a score. For the 2011 fiscal year it ranged from a high of 7.43 in South Dakota (which scored well, in part, because it has no corporate or individual income tax) to a low of 3.96 in New Jersey, which was ranked as having the worst state business tax climate. Rhode Island ranked as the ninth worst, not sixth, as Palumbo asserted. The state has been gradually improving in the rankings since 2006, when it ranked worst. In addition, the Foundation, in its latest report, predicted that Rhode Island will rank significantly higher in its next analysis once changes to the state's income tax code have taken effect. All taxes: The Foundation has what it calls its Tax Freedom Day, which is the number of days that must pass in a year before the average resident has earned enough to pay his or her federal, state and local taxes. For Rhode Islanders, in 2011 that day fell on April 13. Rhode Islander had the 13th highest total tax burden. We didn't rank third, as Palumbo reported. (Mississippi residents were the first to pay them off; their Tax Freedom Day was March 26. Residents of Connecticut, had to work the longest -- until May 2 -- to earn enough. Nationally, the Tax Freedom Day was April 12.) When we asked Palumbo for the source of his numbers, he told us in an e-mail that, "knowing that I was going to be fact-checked, I made sure that the information I had was backed up!" His source: the Foundation's 2010 Facts and Figures booklet, which is outdated. He said it had been mailed to legislators. When we found that booklet online, we discovered that he correctly reported the state and local tax burden from that outdated booklet, but made a common math error in stating the business tax index ranking (when you rank 44th you're seventh from the bottom, not sixth). However we couldn't find any indication, even in the older report, that "we're the third highest per capita in the country for all taxes." In the 2010 report it says we ranked 10th. The only measure by which Rhode Island ranked third was in state debt per capita. The 2011 version is also available online. Our ruling Palumbo spoke with authority, cited specific numbers from a specific source and gave the impression that the numbers were both correct and current. His overall point -- that Rhode Islanders are taxed well above the national average -- is supported by the Tax Foundation's rankings. But he misread the Tax Foundation report in one -- and possibly two -- of the rankings. And those numbers don't accurately reflect Foundation data that have been available at least since the end of March. As a result, we rate his statement as Mostly False.

pomt-02072	"Jeff Merkley was the deciding vote on Obamacare, which in Oregon has been an unmitigated disaster."	false	/oregon/statements/2014/may/23/monica-wehby/was-jeff-merkley-deciding-vote-obamacare/	The race for a U.S. Senate seat representing Oregon is shaping up to be one of the most-watched political contests of the 2014 election. The race between incumbent Democratic Sen. Jeff Merkley and Republican Monica Wehby could well play a pivotal role in whether Democrats maintain their Senate majority. The lead-up to the May 20, 2014, primary proved rockier than expected for Wehby, a political newcomer and pediatric neurosurgeon, when police reports surfaced detailing domestic incidents involving her former husband and an ex-boyfriend. The claim: The day after the primary, Wehby’s campaign put out a news release that appeared aimed at turning the conversation back to the topic she had focused on for weeks -- health care. "Jeff Merkley was the deciding vote on Obamacare," the release stated, "which in Oregon has been an unmitigated disaster." This is hardly the first time a politician has been accused of casting the pivotal vote for the controversial Affordable Care Act. Even so, we thought we’d check to see whether circumstances surrounding Merkley’s vote differ from those of his Democratic colleagues. The analysis: PolitiFact National has checked a slew of claims that different Democratic senators were "the deciding vote." Ken Cuccinelli, Virginia’s former attorney general and candidate for governor, said in November 2013, for instance, that U.S. Sen. Mark Warner, D-Va., cast the deciding vote on the Affordable Care Act. In Florida, an ad made the claim about U.S. Sen. Bill Nelson, while others repeated the assertions about Sens. Michael Bennet and Mark Udall, both Democrats from Colorado. Checks in those cases found that none of the senators cast the "deciding" vote. A little history: The first Senate vote relevant to the issue occurred on Dec. 23, 2009. It was needed to overcome a filibuster and end debate on the bill, to bring it to a vote for final approval. Senate rules require 60 senators to approve such a motion. The vote to defeat the filibuster came in on the number, with Merkley voting with the rest of his party. But his vote was no more vital than any other, especially since his support was not in doubt. Sen. Ben Nelson, D-Neb., by contrast, did need late arm-twisting, agreeing to back the bill only after 13 hours of negotiations, according to news reports at the time. His was the critical 60th vote. Votes on two other bills were needed for the ACA to win final approval. The first, which passed the original version of the Affordable Care Act, needed only a simple majority, making its passage easier. The next was a vote taken March 25, 2010, that officially approved the bill after it had been passed by the House. Merkley joined 56 other senators, making it impossible to say whether his was the vote that sent the ACA to Obama’s desk for signing. We asked Wehby’s campaign to defend the claim. In an email, campaign manager Charlie Pearce replied, "Thanks to Jeff Merkley’s yes vote on Obamacare, 150,000 Oregonians had their health insurance plans canceled. If Jeff Merkley would have had the courage to vote no on that bill, Obamacare would not have passed, and hundreds of millions of taxpayer dollars would not have been wasted on the fiasco that was Cover Oregon." The ruling: Wehby’s campaign, fresh off her win in the GOP Senate primary, sent out a news release pinning responsibility for passage of the Affordable Care Act on her Democratic opponent. "Jeff Merkley was the deciding vote on Obamacare," it said, "which in Oregon has been an unmitigated disaster." The assertion is just the latest to identify a particular Democratic senator as having cast the "deciding" vote for Obamacare. Similar checks have all found the claim to be either Mostly False or False. Wehby’s campaign, asked to defend the claim, sent an email that omitted any mention of Merkley’s "deciding" vote. Her assertion that Merkley’s vote resulted in 150,000 Oregonians having their health care plans canceled is a check we’ll leave for another day. Merkley did join his Democratic colleagues in voting for the bill, but it was a senator from Nebraska who provided the needed 60th vote. We rate this claim False.

pomt-03409	"Not one tax has been raised since I've been governor."	half-true	/new-jersey/statements/2013/jun/30/chris-christie/chris-christie-claims-there-have-been-no-tax-incre/	If Chris Christie is sure about one thing, it’s the lack of any tax increase in New Jersey since he’s been governor. So confident is the governor that he pointed out his achievement during Wednesday’s monthly "Ask The Governor" radio call-in program on New Jersey 101.5 FM. It’s a claim he’s made before. "Not one tax has been raised since I've been governor," Christie said during a brief portion of the show where he compared his fiscal actions as governor with those of state Sen. Barbara Buono (D-Middlesex), who is challenging him in the Nov. 5 gubernatorial contest. Previous Truth-O-Meter rulings have determined this claim isn’t entirely accurate. And PolitiFact New Jersey remains as confident as the governor in that fact. Let’s begin by reviewing the major taxes in New Jersey. It’s true that rates for income, sales and corporation business taxes -- the state’s three biggest revenue generators -- have not gone up under Christie. But tax increases have resulted when Christie cut funding for tax-credit programs, according to several experts who have told us that those reductions are essentially tax increases. "For practical purposes, decreasing tax credits is the same as a tax increase. The person's effective tax rate goes up," David Brunori, a research professor of public policy at The George Washington University, explained in an e-mail. "Still, most people think of tax increases as rate hikes." Rates haven’t increased, but the reduced tax credits mean some homeowners and certain low-income individuals are receiving less money to offset their tax bills. The Earned Income Tax Credit is one example. New Jersey scaled back the EITC during Christie’s first year in office. The state Treasury Department website has explained that the EITC "reduces the amount of New Jersey tax you owe and may also give you a refund, even if you have no tax liability to New Jersey." In addition to that reduction, Christie cut spending for two property tax relief programs. Budget analyses from the state’s nonpartisan Office of Legislative Services showed that homeowners who qualified for one of those programs, now called the Homestead Benefit program, received an average rebate of more than $1,000 in fiscal year 2010. Now, the average credit is less than half that amount. State Treasury Department officials have argued that the tax credit programs are payments from the state, and reductions in credits do not represent tax increases. Bill Quinn, a Treasury Department spokesman, has said that the EITC in most cases actually represented a subsidy to low-income people and noted that more than 75 percent of people getting the credit in 2010 owed no New Jersey tax. Still, Dennis J. Ventry, Jr., a professor at University of California Davis School of Law, said that a reduction in a tax credit is "absolutely a tax increase." "Tax credits reduce tax liability for eligible claimants. Thus, cutting, restricting, or repealing a tax credit for an otherwise eligible individual or business would -- absent other changes to the tax system such as a reduction in rates -- result in higher taxes owed," Ventry said. Richard Pomp, a law professor at the University of Connecticut and state taxation expert said debate about the issue is semantics. "To someone who has had a benefit cut that is less money they have to spend," whether you call it a tax increase or a spending cut. However, Joseph Henchman, vice president of legal and state projects at the Tax Foundation, a business-backed group, said it’d be wrong to equate reductions in tax credits as tax increases or spending cuts. "They have elements of both and are strictly neither," he said. Our ruling Christie said on a radio program, "Not one tax has been raised since I've been governor." The governor is correct that the major taxes in New Jersey that generate revenue have not increased. But he doesn’t acknowledge that cuts he’s made to tax-relief programs have resulted in tax increases for certain segments of the population. Several experts we talked to agreed that reductions in tax-relief programs can result in higher taxes owed for some people. That amounts to an increase, and that’s why this claim is rated Half True.

pomt-04611	"Forty-seven percent of Americans pay no income tax."	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/sep/18/mitt-romney/romney-says-47-percent-americans-pay-no-income-tax/	Mitt Romney told wealthy donors gathered at a high-dollar campaign fundraiser that there’s a group of voters he believes he can never win over: people who pay no taxes. Video of Romney speaking at the event, held in Boca Raton, Fla., was leaked to the liberal magazine Mother Jones on Sept. 17, 2012, stirring up controversy in the heated presidential race. In his remarks, Romney used broad strokes to characterize millions of people who he said solidly support President Barack Obama. "There are 47 percent of the people who will vote for the president no matter what," Romney said in the video. "All right, there are 47 percent who are with him, who are dependent upon government, who believe that they are victims, who believe the government has a responsibility to care for them, who believe that they are entitled to health care, to food, to housing, to you-name-it. That that's an entitlement. And the government should give it to them. And they will vote for this president no matter what. "And I mean the president starts out with 48, 49 percent … he starts off with a huge number," Romney continued. "These are people who pay no income tax. Forty-seven percent of Americans pay no income tax. So our message of low taxes doesn’t connect. So he’ll be out there talking about tax cuts for the rich. I mean, that’s what they sell every four years. And so my job is is not to worry about those people. I’ll never convince them that they should take personal responsibility and care for their lives." We’re checking several claims from his remarks at the May 2012 event. Taxes are a contentious issue in the presidential campaign, and the statistic Romney mentioned was sure to pique the attention of the ostensible 1-percenters in his audience. As for his claim that 47 percent of Americans pay no income tax at all: Guess what? He’s right. Who pays It's clear Romney is referring to federal taxes and his figure mirrors one from the Urban Institute-Brookings Institution Tax Policy Center, which found that in 2011, 46 percent of tax filers paid no income tax, vs. about 54 percent of tax filers that did have some federal income tax liability. In 2009, the Tax Policy Center estimated the proportion who paid no taxes was 47 percent. About half of people who don’t pay income taxes are simply poor, and the tax code explicitly exempts them. "For example, a couple with two children earning less than $26,400 will pay no federal income tax this year because their $11,600 standard deduction and four exemptions of $3,700 each reduce their taxable income to zero," Roberton Williams, a scholar with the Tax Policy Center, wrote last year. "The basic structure of the income tax simply exempts subsistence levels of income from tax." The remaining Americans who owe no federal income taxes are benefiting from tax breaks, the center found. "Three-fourths of those households pay no income tax because of provisions that benefit senior citizens and low-income working families with children. Those provisions include the exclusion of some Social Security benefits from taxable income, the tax credit and extra standard deduction for the elderly, and the child, earned income, and child care tax credits that primarily help low-income workers with children," he wrote. PolitiFact Oregon examined a claim similar to this one last year, citing research by the Joint Committee on Taxation, a bipartisan committee of Congress. The committee found that for 2009, roughly 22 percent of "tax units" ended up without any tax liability. Another 30 percent got all their tax money back from the government, through mechanisms such as the Earned Income Tax Credit, which encourages low-income Americans to work by refunding money to them through the tax code. By contrast, the committee found just 49 percent of Americans owed anything to the government. Put another way, 51 percent of taxpayers in 2009 had zero liability, according to the committee’s research. Our ruling Romney said at the fundraising event that "47 percent of Americans pay no income tax." He didn’t specify federal income tax, and many states do levy their own income taxes. But since Romney was referring to a sector of the entire American population, we think it’s clear he was talking about federal taxes. Research by the Tax Policy Center supports his claim. The think tank found that many Americans are so poor that they owe no taxes, and others qualify for enough breaks and exemptions to reduce their liability to nothing. Another report by the Joint Committee on Taxation from 2009 found an even larger share of Americans who owed nothing. We rate Romney’s statement True.

pomt-04194	"The five economic indicators that the federal government tracks - for the first time since August 2006 - were positive this October."	true	/rhode-island/statements/2012/dec/09/lincoln-chafee/rhode-island-governor-lincoln-chafee-says-five-eco/	"Are we there yet?" Anyone who has driven the family to a vacation on Cape Cod has heard that question rise up from the back seats, a plaintive cry for progress as the traffic crawls toward the Bourne Bridge. After four straight years of unemployment over 9 percent, Rhode Islanders wonder how long their road to economic recovery is going to be. Governor Chafee made the case earlier this month that, though it’s been slow going, the state is making progress. In a Dec. 1 interview with The Providence Journal about his plans for the state Economic Development Commission, Chafee said the state isn’t getting enough credit for the progress it has made on the economy, particularly this year. "We're seeing unemployment going in the right direction, for the last six months," he said. "The five economic indicators that the federal government tracks -- for the first time since August 2006 -- were positive this October." We weren’t sure which indicators he was talking about or whether they were actually all in positive territory, so we decided to check. The state and federal governments track the labor market through a variety of statistics. The most commonly watched by the public is the unemployment rate. But other indices are used too. The numbers don’t always move in the same direction. Improvement in one can be offset by setbacks in another. For example, if the size of the workforce goes down but the number of unemployed stays the same, the unemployment rate will go up. Chafee was touting the five indicators for the month of September (they were released in October, hence his reference to them as October numbers), because the bad numbers (concerning unemployment) all fell and the good numbers (employment) all rose, and all at the same time. Laura Hart, a spokeswoman for the state Department of Labor and Training, said the five federal categories Chafee was referring to are the same key indicators the state tracks, through data approved by the federal Department of Labor. Here are the indicators for Rhode Island, and how they changed from August to September, as reported by the state DLT: - The unemployment rate dropped from 10.7 to 10.5 percent - The number of unemployed people dropped from 59,221 to 58,663 - The number of employed people (at jobs in Rhode Island and nearby states) increased from 495,480 to 499,480 - The total work force (the number of people available to work) went up from 554,701 to 558,143 - The number of in-state jobs went from 456,000 to 459,500 . The last time those five indices all went in the right direction was from July to August of 2006, when the unemployment rate went from 5.1 to 5 percent. So Chafee was right. DLT spokeswoman Laura Hart cautioned that the month-to-month figures are extrapolations from polling of residents and employers and could be revised in March, when employers file tax information. She compared it to the difference between a poll and an election. Chafee is not alone in seeing some movement, however slow, in the state’s economic recovery. University of Rhode Island economics Prof. Leonard Lardaro has commented on the underappreciated progress the state is making, but noted that it seems to come in fits and starts. "While Rhode Island’s economy remained in a recovery, the magnitude of which almost nobody in this state seems to fully comprehend, the pace of that recovery tapered off a bit in September following a very strong August," Lardaro wrote in his Rhode Island economics blog Nov. 12. In a report prepared for the Dec. 6 Fall Economic Outlook Conference hosted by the New England Economic Partnership at Bryant University, Edward M. Mazze, a former dean and current business professor at the University of Rhode Island, and Edinaldo Tebaldi, associate economics professor at Bryant, noted the state’s sluggish recovery rate, predicting that Rhode Island’s unemployment rate may not fall below 7 percent until 2016. Our ruling Governor Chafee said five economic indicators tracked by the federal government went up in October, the first time they’ve done so in the same month in six years. Regardless of whether you believe the state has finally turned the economic corner, he got the facts right. We find his statement True.

pomt-04071	"The governor does not have any power to veto a referendum [on same-sex marriage] that would be a constitutional amendment."	mostly true	/rhode-island/statements/2013/jan/23/christopher-plante/christopher-plante-says-rhode-islands-governor-can/	As the debate over same-sex marriage heats up again in Rhode Island, there is talk of allowing voters, rather than the legislature, to decide the issue. Gov. Lincoln Chafee has said he would veto such a proposal if it were passed by the General Assembly. He has called on the legislature to approve same-sex marriage, which would make it legal in Rhode Island, as it is in the other five New England states. [The House Judiciary Committee passed it Tuesday; the full House of Representatives is expected to pass it this week. It faces a less certain fate in the Senate.] During a Jan. 13 interview on WLNE-TV, former Providence Mayor Vincent A. "Buddy" Cianci Jr. raised the referendum question with Christopher Plante, executive director of the National Organization for Marriage-Rhode Island, which opposes same-sex marriage. Cianci asked Plante what he thought of Chafee's promise to veto a referendum. Plante said Chafee couldn't do that. "The governor does not have any power to veto a referendum that would be a constitutional amendment," he said. This is a case in which context is especially important. First, let's just consider Plante's statement without its context. If a referendum on same-sex marriage were drafted as a constitutional amendment, Plante would be correct. Although Chapter IX, Section 14 gives the governor the ability to veto any legislation passed by the General Assembly, it specifically excludes proposed constitutional amendments, which must always go before the voters. (The governor also gets no veto over General Assembly votes that involve in-house matters such as the decision to adjourn.) Now let's consider the context. Cianci didn't ask the question in the framework of a constitutional amendment. While all proposed constitutional amendments must be placed on the ballot, all ballot questions aren't constitutional amendments. Sen. Frank A. Ciccone, a Providence Democrat who opposes same-sex marriage, has said he would propose an amendment, but that's unlikely to pass both chambers. The legislation now before the House simply proposes changing the law, not the state Constitution. If the legislature instead voted to put it on the ballot, its decision would be subject to a gubernatorial veto. Plante, in e-mails, acknowledged that Chafee would have veto power if same-sex marriage was put to the voters as a non-constitutional question. But he said he always answers the question the way he did because he believes same-sex marriage SHOULD be a constitutional question, a point he subsequently raised in the interview with Cianci. "That's what we would be looking for because, if anything's going to happen with marriage, it should happen by the people," he said. "We voted on whether we should change the name of the state. We voted on casinos. How much more important is the institution of marriage?" Our ruling Christopher Plante said Gov. Lincoln Chafee "does not have any power to veto a referendum that would be a constitutional amendment" on the issue of same-sex marriage. It's true, as Plante said, that the governor has no veto power over constitutional amendments proposed by the General Assembly. But the question wasn't posed that way, and Plante's answer might have given some viewers the false impression that Chafee has no say if the General Assembly decides to send the question of same-sex marriage to the voters. Because his statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information, we rate it Mostly True.

pomt-15129	"Twenty-three million Americans suffer from addiction, but only 1 in 10 get treatment."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/sep/04/hillary-clinton/hillary-clinton-says-23-million-americans-suffer-a/	Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton recently announced a $10 billion proposal for treating drug and alcohol addiction. While addiction and treatment has not traditionally been a top-tier issue in presidential races, it has attracted concern in key caucus and primary states this year, including New Hampshire, where Clinton announced her proposal in an op-ed in the New Hampshire Union-Leader. In explaining why an assertive policy response was necessary, Clinton wrote in the op-ed, among other claims, that "23 million Americans suffer from addiction, but only 1 in 10 get treatment." We wondered if her figures are accurate. On the ratio, Clinton is close. The most recent data from the federally sponsored National Survey on Drug Use and Health estimated that 22.7 million Americans needed treatment for a drug alcohol problem but only about 2.5 million received treatment "at a specialty facility." That means 11 percent of people who conceivably could have needed treatment at a specialty facility received it, or one out of every nine. This ratio has held steady over the years, said Arthur Robinson Williams, a fellow in the division on substance abuse in Columbia University’s Department of Psychiatry. "The 2013 survey was consistent with prior findings and estimates," Williams said. Still, we wondered about the survey’s use of the term "specialty facility." What does that mean? We found the definition: It refers to "treatment received at drug or alcohol rehabilitation facilities (inpatient or outpatient), hospitals (inpatient services only), and mental health centers; it excludes treatment received in an emergency room, private doctor's office, self-help group, prison or jail, or hospital as an outpatient." Among the forms of treatment not counted are groups such as Alcoholics Anonymous. Not everyone agrees that AA is effective (or effective for everyone), and it is perhaps most helpful as reinforcement to other types of treatment led by clinicians. Still, the number of participants is hardly trivial: AA counted 1,283,704 members in the United States as of Jan. 1, 2015, plus an additional 35,349 in correctional facilities. Thousands more attended Narcotics Anonymous and other 12-step groups. As for excluding private doctor visits, the distinctions "are likely true, but largely irrelevant," said David Rosenbloom, a professor of health policy and management at the Boston University School of Public Health. "Treatment in doctor’s offices is a relatively recent development, as medication-assisted addiction treatment through the medical care system has achieved regulatory approval." While "many people with addiction could be treated in the regular medical care system," Rosenbloom said, "the delivery mechanism to get from here to there isn’t in place yet." Allowing for some definitional concerns about the numbers, Clinton "is mainly right," said Arthur L. Caplan, director of the division of medical ethics at the New York University Langone Medical Center. Our ruling Clinton said that "23 million Americans suffer from addiction, but only 1 in 10 get treatment." To be fully accurate, the claim needs some modest tweaks. The actual ratio is about one of nine, not one in 10, and it’s worth noting that the treatment statistics include only the most intensive methods, leaving out such widely used approaches as Alcoholics Anonymous. Still, experts said Clinton’s claim is close to accurate. We rate it Mostly True.	None	Hillary Clinton	None	None	None	2015-09-04T09:25:58	2015-09-01	['United_States']
pomt-12650	"The vast majority of marketplace enrollees have experienced no average premium hike at all."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2017/mar/23/barack-obama/obama-no-premium-hike-vast-majority-covered-govern/	On the day House Republicans had scheduled a vote to repeal and replace Obamacare, the man whose name became synonymous with the sweeping health care law touted its accomplishments. Marking the seventh anniversary of the Affordable Care Act, former President Barack Obama released a statement saying that after a century of talk, "we finally declared that in America, health care is not a privilege for a few, but a right for everybody." "Reality continues to discredit the false claim that this law is in a ‘death spiral,’ because while it’s true that some premiums have risen, the vast majority of Marketplace enrollees have experienced no average premium hike at all," he wrote. We decided to vet the assertion that on average, the vast majority of people who signed up on a federal or state marketplaces saw no premium hike at all. Government numbers back that up, although the meaning of "vast majority" lies in the beholder. And it’s not as though premiums didn’t rise. They did, but most people purchasing health care through the marketplace didn’t feel it. According to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, about 12.2 million people signed up through a federal or state-based marketplace, also called an exchange. Of those, 7.8 million, about 64 percent, qualified for tax credits to reduce how much they personally would pay for coverage. Thanks to the tax credits, the average monthly bill for insurance stayed at $106 from 2016 to 2017, as the government chart below shows. The light blue represents the monthly premium paid by customers out-of-pocket. The darker blue represents the tax credit. "Premiums went up, but a lot of people were protected from that," said Katherine Hempstead, director of health insurance coverage at the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, a philanthropy and research group based in New Jersey. The Congressional Budget Office underscored that dynamic in its most recent report on health care legislation. The analysts wrote that many people "are largely insulated from increases in premiums because their out-of-pocket payments for premiums are based on a percentage of their income; the government pays the difference." On average, premiums rose about 32 percent. The government data on the actual premiums people pay isn’t 100 percent complete. Details on about 3 million people who signed up through state-based exchanges are missing. But Hempstead said in the past, people in both groups had similar experiences. "The only place you can get the subsidy is through the exchanges, so for both the federal and the state exchanges, most of the enrollment is from people who qualify for the subsidies," Hempstead said. It’s worth noting that as premiums rise, so does the price tag for Washington. The death spiral debate Obama was rebutting fears about a death spiral. That concern lies outside this fact-check, but we’ll summarize the arguments on both sides here. A death spiral takes place when costs rise so fast, healthy people begin opting to pay a tax penalty rather than pay for health care. With sicker people making up a larger percentage of those left in the health insurance pool, the average cost of care rises dramatically. White House press secretary Sean Spicer took on Obama’s statement during his daily press briefing. "Enrollment is nowhere near expectations and this year is actually declining," Spicer said. "Insurers are fleeing the exchanges, and one in three counties only has one insurer." A 2016 summary from Mark Farrah Associates, a private analytic service, reported that insurers who left the exchanges cited "significant losses on Marketplace business" due in part to lower numbers of healthy enrollees. As for enrollment overall, according to the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services, sign-ups fell by about 4 percent from 2016 to 2017. Outside analysts such as Hempstead say that’s not enough to spell trouble. "Enrollments are largely holding steady," she said. "There is no death spiral." The Congressional Budget Office largely agreed. Comparing the Affordable Care Act with the Republican health care bill, the CBO wrote that "the nongroup market would probably be stable in most areas under either current law or the legislation." Our ruling Obama said that on average, the "vast majority" of people who have insurance through Obamacare experienced no premium increase. The actual numbers are that about 64 percent of enrollees saw their out-of-pocket premiums stay the same. So in terms of their personal experience, the former president is correct. However, premiums did rise. The reason many people didn’t feel it is because the government subsidies increased to insulate them. Obama was largely correct, but he brushed over the reality of rising premiums. We rate this claim Mostly True.

pomt-10962	On maintaining Medicaid expansion in Ohio as part of the Affordable Care Act	full flop	/ohio/statements/2018/jul/20/mike-dewine/ohio-republican-mike-dewine-changed-medicaid/	Ohio Attorney General Mike DeWine, the Republican running for governor, announced July 11 that he supports keeping Medicaid expansion, leading Democrats to accuse him of flip-flopping. "The DeWine-Husted Administration will need to keep extended Medicaid coverage for adults," DeWine said during a press conference where the Ohio State Medical Association PAC endorsed his campaign. "We will also reform the program. This is consistent with what we have been saying." DeWine’s Democratic rival Richard Cordray pushed back on DeWine’s statement that he had been consistent on Medicaid expansion. "This is such an enormous flip-flop that it's more likely a belly flop!" Cordray tweeted. About 700,000 Ohioans have Medicaid due to the expansion under the Affordable Care Act. We will examine DeWine’s statements on our Flip-O-Meter, which measures if politicians’ have flip-flopped and to what extent. Some voters see flip-flops as a sign of hypocrisy while others may view them as a politician evolving on an issue. We found that for years DeWine has opposed the Affordable Care Act, which included Medicaid expansion. At times he has been vague when pressed to give a yes-or-no answer on Medicaid expansion, and he’s repeated a talking point that he wanted to reform the program. In July, he came out in support of the expansion. DeWine on Medicaid expansion before the 2018 campaign On DeWine’s first day in office as attorney general in 2011, he authorized Ohio to join the multistate lawsuit challenging the constitutionality of the Affordable Care Act. His statement called the law a "huge federal overreach" and criticized the individual mandate. The lawsuit challenged a few core provisions of the law, including Medicaid expansion, which came with an implied threat that the government would withhold funding unless states complied. When DeWine spelled out what he thought were the sins of the law in an op-ed in the Washington Times in 2012, he included Medicaid expansion, although Ohio had not yet signed on to expansion. "Obamacare is, quite simply, the federal version of Romneycare," DeWine wrote the day after the lawsuit was argued before the U.S. Supreme Court. "All of the problems that we have seen unfold in Massachusetts -- doctor shortages, Medicaid expansion and escalating health insurance costs -- are already starting to take place across the country as Obamacare is implemented." The Supreme Court upheld the individual mandate and ruled that states would have a choice about expanding Medicaid. The next year, Ohio Republican Gov. John Kasich expanded Medicaid. In 2017, DeWine refused to take sides in the battle between Kasich and the GOP-controlled General Assembly about expansion. DeWine’s talking point about a third option on Medicaid When DeWine launched his campaign for governor in June 2017, he was asked at a forum if he would end Medicaid expansion. "I’m against Obamacare; this is part of Obamacare," he said. In June 2017 DeWine said in a TV interview that the Medicaid expansion "has done a lot of good for people who do have an addiction." DeWine said that "smart sheriffs" are helping inmates enroll in Medicaid when they leave jail. "We don’t want that to go away," he said. During the primary, DeWine avoided giving a yes-or-no answer to whether he would maintain Medicaid expansion although he said that it was "financially unsustainable." His talking point was that he would pursue a "third way," which included seeking a waiver from the federal government to change the program. Ohio already has a pending waiver with the federal government to add work requirements. DeWine announces support for Medicaid expansion On July 11, the Ohio State Medical Association announced that DeWine had gained it's backing in part because he agreed to keep the Medicaid expansion. At the press conference, DeWine emphasized that he wanted drug addicts to continue getting treatment through Medicaid expansion. He vowed to "keep extended Medicaid coverage for adults" as well as to reform the program to encourage able-bodied adults to work. DeWine said that "there is no change" to his Medicaid policy. "What we said all along is it had to be reformed," he said. Our conclusion When DeWine came out in support of Medicaid expansion, his critics accused him of flip-flopping. For years, DeWine has opposed the Affordable Care Act, which included Medicaid expansion. DeWine's position has evolved, though. During the primary he said that the program was financially unsustainable and needed reform, but he's also said that Medicaid expansion helped drug addicts pay for treatment. On July 11, DeWine announced that he would keep Medicaid expansion. The change of positions has happened over the course of several years, but it is a distinct change. We rate this a Full Flop.

pomt-02469	"Oregon and the federal government now have more than one million acres of burnt land and millions of trees are being left to rot."	half-true	/oregon/statements/2014/feb/21/gordon-challstrom/do-oregon-and-federal-government-have-more-1-milli/	The timber wars of the 1980s and the lawsuits they spawned brought logging on Oregon’s public lands almost to a halt. Even now, annual timber harvests are a fraction of what they were several decades ago. The issue of how much timber should be cut has flared up again as Congress wrestles with a plan, unveiled by U.S. Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., that could double harvests on more than 2 million acres of federal forests across western Oregon. The Claim Medford businessman Gordon Challstrom, a Republican gubernatorial candidate, wants harvest levels far higher than they are now. In a recent website statement, Challstrom wrote, "Oregon and the federal government now have more than one million acres of burnt land and millions of trees being left to rot." One million acres of burnt land? Millions of trees left to rot? We took a look. The Analysis We called Challstrom and asked how he arrived at his figures. He directed us to an online map managed by the Northwest Interagency Coordination Center that lets people click on areas that have burned in recent years. A box pops up displaying the name of the fire, when it started and how many acres it consumed. Although Challstrom’s claim included no time frame, he told us he arrived at his figure by adding acreage totals of fires larger than 10,000 acres. Going back as far as initial salvage efforts in the wake of the giant Southern Oregon Biscuit Fire in 2002, he came up with 2.7 million acres. Since 51 percent of Oregon’s land is owned by the federal government, he said, he applied that to the 2.7 million acre number and ended up with the 1.4 million acres he’s characterizing as "burnt land." (The Congressional Research Service puts federal ownership of lands in the state at 53 percent.) Here’s how Challstrom got to his final 1 million figure: "I tried to be fair," he said. "I gave them the benefit of the doubt that they’ve logged on 400,000 acres, but I really doubt it." The assertion that "millions of trees" are being left to rot on that acreage, he added, "only stands to reason." We added up totals from the interactive map and arrived at about the same 2.7 million acre figure Challstrom did. But we had questions about the way he came up with his 1 million acre total for "burnt land." We called Isaiah Hirschfield, intelligence officer at the interagency coordination center, which tracks long-term fire information. He said Challstrom’s methodology assumed that fires would break out evenly across the state, thus allowing him to come up with his 1 million acre figure by dividing total lands burned by the acreage owned by the federal government. "That’s not an effective way to come up with that calculation," he said. Even so, Hirschfield added, Challstrom’s figure turns out to be in the ballpark. Citing agency statistics, he said an average of 250,000 acres have burned each year going back a decade. "Cumulatively," he said, "that’s 2.5 million acres, so he’s still pretty close." Hirschfield pointed out an important caveat -- a portion of those burns, including a couple very big ones, were on both publicly and privately owned rangeland east of the Cascades. So while those blazes charred a lot of grass, they didn’t touch many trees. Challstrom’s claim did say "more than" one million acres. And while areas that burned a decade ago are more than likely covered with new vegetation by now, according to experts we talked to, it’s still true that more than one million acres of land burned in Oregon during the combined 2012 and 2013 fire seasons, according to U.S. Forest Service statistics. Verifying the second part of the claim -- the "millions of trees left to rot" -- is more difficult. For additional perspective, we called Paul Barnum, executive director of the Oregon Forest Resources Institute, an agency established by the Oregon Legislature in 1991 to gather and provide information about forest management. Forests west of the Cascades average 200 to 400 trees per acre, he said, while their eastside counterparts have sometimes ended up crammed with as many as 4,000. That occurred, he said, because of historic fire-suppression efforts. Some forests are so overgrown that a spark can result in a catastrophic wildlife. "What’s true is that there never should have been that much biomass per acre in eastern Oregon," Barnum said. "With that noted, it could very well be true that there are millions of trees left in those areas. But without walking every acre, there is really no way of verifying that." John Bailey, silviculture and fire professor in Oregon State University’s College of Forestry, agreed. "This would be nearly impossible to check," he wrote in an email. "This analysis has been done for a few individual fires such as the much studied 2002 Biscuit Fire in southwest Oregon, but I don’t know anyone who has consolidated this data for all fires in the past decade." To arrive at a reasonable estimate, you would need to know not only the number of acres burned in each fire, but also how many trees per acre there were, what percent were killed in the fire and how much salvage logging was done, according to Bailey. The Ruling Challstrom, as part of his 2014 gubernatorial campaign, said Oregon, as a result of forest fires, has "more than one million acres of burnt land and millions of trees left to rot." The first part of the claim is easily verified by simply adding up total acres burned in forest fires over the past decade or so. The second part, according to two forestry experts, is impossible to pin down. As for Challstrom’s claim, part of it is accurate, even if he used some faulty analysis to arrive at it. The second part is nearly impossible to verify but, according to one expert "could very well be true." We rate Challstrom’s claim Half True.

pomt-07713	Says Michelle Obama has 43 people on her staff; Nancy Reagan had just 3.	pants on fire!	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/mar/04/glenn-beck/glenn-beck-says-first-lady-michelle-obama-has-43-h/	Glenn Beck rekindled a falsehood about the size of Michelle Obama's staff last week, comparing the first lady to Marie Antoinette, and citing her large staff as evidence that the Obamas are "out of control." On his radio program on Feb. 25, 2011, Beck asked a researcher to find out how many people are now on Michelle Obama's staff. Beck then immediately supplied his own estimate. "It's like 43," Beck said. And, Beck said, "They just hired a personal shopper who is going to coordinate all of her purchases and look for discounts if they're available." "Forty-three people!" Beck added. "I think Nancy Reagan may have been the one who had the most people on the staff. She had three. Three!" "The first lady's office needs 43 people? For what? These people are out of control. It is really Marie Antoinette." Allegations that Michelle Obama has an excessively large staff compared to other first ladies is nothing new. In 2009, FactCheck.org and Snopes.com debunked the claim circulated in a chain e-mail that Michelle Obama had an "unprecedented" number of staffers, with 22. Here, Beck has upped the alleged number of staffers to 43. And he claims that when Nancy Reagan was first lady, she had just three. We went first to the 2010 Annual Report to Congress on White House Staff, the latest online data, and did a search for anyone with the words "first lady" in their title. That turned up 15 staffers. We also searched "social" and found three more on Michelle Obama's staff. But titles don't give the full picture. Myra Gutin, an expert on first ladies and politics at Rider University in New Jersey, said that as of 2009, Michelle Obama had 22 people on her staff. Gutin didn't have any more recent tallies, but she highly doubts it nearly doubled to the 43 cited by Beck. Catherine McCormick-Lelyveld, a spokeswoman for Michelle Obama, told us via e-mail that Michelle Obama's staff is now closer to 25 people. How does that stack up? "First lady Michelle Obama’s staff is no different in size than that of her predecessor, Laura Bush -- around 25 people -- and is based on a similar staffing model," said McCormick-Lelyveld. "So suggestions that our staff is larger are wrong. While every first lady approaches the job differently, the responsibilities of the office of the first lady have grown over the years to include planning and hosting hundreds of events at the White House and across the city of D.C., planning and supporting domestic and foreign travel with and without President Obama, receiving, cataloging and responding to thousands of pieces of mail, and supporting the first lady’s active schedule in support of the President -- hence the staff size for both Mrs. Bush and Mrs. Obama." The size of a first lady's staff fluctuates year to year. First ladies typically have several staff members each handling correspondence, press, social engagements and projects. At 25, Michelle Obama's staff is similar in size to her immediate predecessors. According to an Associated Press story on October 6, 2009, Laura Bush had a staff of between 24 and 26 by the end of President George W. Bush's term in 2009, citing Anita McBride, Laura Bush's chief of staff. And according to the Clinton Presidential Library, the size of Hillary Rodham Clinton's staff fluctuated from 13 in October 1993 to 19 by March 2000, the AP story said. Beck singled out Nancy Reagan, and claimed she had just three employees on her staff. Our first stop to check that was the Ronald Reagan Library, where Archivist Kelly D. Barton forwarded us a list -- based on the internal Executive Office of the President phone books -- of all the full-time staffers who worked in the first lady's office. In all, that came to 53 employees. But they weren't all serving at once, of course. So we turned to Sheila Tate, vice chair of the Washington, D.C., communications firm Powell Tate, who was Nancy's Reagan's press secretary. By Tate's off-the-top-of-the-head count, there were 15 people on First Lady Nancy Reagan's staff. That includes four on the press team (including Tate); two in the projects office; two in the advance office; three in the social office; a personal secretary and her assistant; and the chief of staff and his assistant. There are other people who worked in the East Wing, Tate said, including a large social and calligraphy staff that has nothing to do with changes in administrations. Tate's not sure what jobs Beck counted to get his number for Nancy Reagan's staff (and our efforts to reach his show were unsuccessful), but by any measure, she said, the claim that Nancy Reagan had only three on her staff is "clearly wrong." Stacy A. Cordery, a history professor at Monmouth College who serves as bibliographer for the National First Ladies' Library in Ohio, said the role of first ladies has expanded over the decades, and so has the size of the staffs. "Edith Roosevelt hired the first social secretary, Isabelle Hagner," Cordery told us via e-mail. "Ever since 1901, first ladies have had assistance carrying out their duties--duties which are not defined in any job description nor laid out in any part of the Constitution. The first lady's correspondence is massive and her obligations as the 'hostess' of the White House have not decreased over time. Once first ladies took on causes (there were some before Eleanor Roosevelt, but she fundamentally changed Americans' expectations of the first lady) then their need for help increased. Modern first ladies like Lady Bird Johnson, Rosalyn Carter, Betty Ford, Barbara Bush, Hillary Clinton, Laura Bush and Nancy Reagan, have all used many more staff people than three." And Beck's comment that Michelle Obama "just hired a personal shopper" also is wrong. The claim appears to have its roots in a Feb. 21, 2011, Washington Post report that, "according to several people with knowledge of her White House arrangement," Chicago boutique owner Ikram Goldman's role as "shopper in chief" has been taken over by Michelle Obama's longtime personal assistant, Meredith Koop. "There has been no recent addition of a personal shopper," said McCormick-Lelyveld. "Like previous first ladies, Mrs. Obama has a personal aide who is part of the residence staff and who provides general support for the first lady, including purchasing clothes when necessary." So to summarize, Michelle Obama has a staff of 25, not 43 as Beck claimed. Nancy Reagan had a staff of about 15 (not 3, as Beck claimed). The size of Michelle Obama's staff is similar to that of her immediate predecessors. And she did not just hire a new personal shopper. In short, Beck's outrage is based on numbers that are wildly off the mark. We rate his claim Pants on Fire.

pomt-08741	"We spend more money on health care per capita in the United States than any other country in the world. Of the 30 developed countries in the world, we spend 2 1/2 times more than the average. Of the country that spends the second most per capita, Switzerland, we spend 175 percent more."	half-true	/texas/statements/2010/aug/31/david-dewhurst/lt-gov-david-dewhurst-says-united-states-spends-mo/	Lt. Gov. David Dewhurst opposes the health care overhaul carried into law by Democrats this spring, but he agrees that something needs to be done because "we spend more money on health care per capita in the United States than any other country in the world," Dewhurst said during an Aug. 25 meeting with the Austin American-Statesman editorial board. "Of the 30 developed countries in the world," he said, "we spend 2 1/2 times more than the average. Of the country that spends the second most per capita, Switzerland, we spend 175 percent more." Dewhurst didn't respond to our requests for back-up on his statement, which was similar to a remark he made to the Texas Tribune in May. Seeking authoritative international perspective, we turned to health statistics from the Organization for Economical Cooperation and Development (OECD), a group that represents 32 advanced, industrialized nations, mostly in Europe, Asia and North America. Though experts warned PolitiFact that there are variations from country to country in how statistics are reported, the OECD's data is widely considered the most reliable way to compare the U.S. to its international peers on a variety of economic and social metrics. We found a table comparing total health costs per capita of 31 OECD countries, plus three more — Estonia, Israel, Slovenia — that were awaiting admission to the OECD at the time the data was released, on June 29. (Slovenia has since made the cut.) The OECD's most recent figures, for 2006-2008 (the year varies by country), shows the U.S. spent the most: $7,538 per person. Norway had the second highest cost per person, at $5,003, followed by Switzerland ($4,627). Turkey spent the least — $767 per capita. The only other countries where per capita health care expenditures exceeded $4,000 were Luxembourg and Canada. This isn't a new No. 1 for the United States. We reviewed the OECD's statistics for the past two decades; the United States leads in spending each year. In 1990, we spent $2,810 per person, followed by Switzerland ($2,028) and Germany ($1,764). The OECD's data starts in 1960, when the United States was second in health care costs per capita at $148 to Switzerland's $166. As of late, the average health care cost per capita of all OECD countries: $3,000. So Dewhurst is correct that we spend 2 1/2 times more than the average per capita. However, the statistics suggest, Switzerland doesn't spend the second most per capita — Norway does. Another departure from Dewhurst's statement: we only spend about 50 percent more than Norway and 63 percent more than Switzerland, not 175 percent more, as Dewhurst says. Dewhurst was speaking off the cuff; perhaps he meant to say that we spend 175 percent of Switzerland's health care costs per capita, which translates into spending 75 percent more — much closer to the 63 percent figure. PolitiFact.com in Washington covered similar ground in March when it rated True former Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney's statement that "the lifespan of the average American is less than that of people in nations that spend far less" on health care. "To put it bluntly, we spend more and die sooner," Romney said. Recap: As far as we can tell — and keeping in mind that Dewhurst didn't respond to our queries for backup — he was spot-on in saying the United States spends more money on health care per capita than the rest of the world, and he's right that we spend two-and-a-half times more than the average cost of all the OECD countries. He erred in his Switzerland comparison. We rate his statement as Half True.	None	David Dewhurst	None	None	None	2010-08-31T06:00:00	2010-08-25	['United_States', 'Switzerland']
pomt-02075	Cap and trade legislation "was originally a Republican idea."	mostly true	/florida/statements/2014/may/23/debbie-wasserman-schultz/cap-and-trade-legislation-was-originally-republica/	U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio, a GOP presidential contender, made waves about climate change in a May 11 interview with ABC’s Jonathan Karl on This Week. "I do not believe that human activity is causing these dramatic changes to our climate the way these scientists are portraying it," Rubio said. "And I do not believe that the laws that they propose we pass will do anything about it. Except it will destroy our economy." One of Florida’s other nationally watched politicians -- Democratic National Committee chair Debbie Wasserman Schultz -- criticized her fellow Floridian’s stance. After a May 13 speech at Daemen College in upstate New York, an audience member asked her how to get "Congress unstuck in stomping on science." Wasserman Schultz suggested that voters stop electing tea party-aligned politicians -- and then she turned her sights on Rubio for disagreeing with the scientific consensus that climate change is man-made. Wasserman Schultz, who represents parts of Broward and Miami-Dade counties, said rising sea levels and flooding will make part of her district uninhabitable in the future. She called for politicians to reach across the aisle in search of solutions, singling out a cap and trade plan as an area where the parties could agree. "That was originally a Republican idea. It was developed in the 1970s when the Clean Air Act was initially adopted." We decided to check Wasserman Schultz’s claim that cap and trade was originally a Republican idea. Cap and trade The idea of cap and trade is that the government sets a limit (the cap) on how much carbon individual companies -- typically electric utilities and manufacturers -- can emit. The government then issues permits to companies and allows them to buy and sell the permits as needed (the trade). If the policy works as planned, overall emissions decline, companies determine for themselves the best way to lower emissions, and the free market rewards those who lower emissions most effectively. Wasserman Schultz started the clock ticking in the 1970s. Her spokesman, Sean Bartlett, told PolitiFact Florida that "the 1977 Clean Air Act amendments were the first time federal law used the concept of offset mechanisms that ultimately became the ‘cap and trade’ systems." That law included precursor ideas, such as providing industry with flexibility to meet limits, rather than simply imposing controlling regulations, said Eric Pooley, a spokesman for the Environmental Defense Fund and author of The Climate War: True Believers, Power Brokers, and the Fight to Save the Earth. In the 1980s, President Ronald Reagan used a cap and trade system to phase out leaded gasoline, noted MIT economics professor Richard Schmalensee and Harvard Kennedy School government professor Robert Stavins. In 1989, President George H. W. Bush proposed the use of a cap and trade system to cut by half sulfur dioxide emissions from coal-fired power plants and consequent acid rain, they wrote in a Boston Globe op-ed in 2010. "An initially resistant Democratic Congress overwhelmingly endorsed the proposal," the professors wrote. "The landmark Clean Air Act amendments of 1990 passed the Senate 89 to 10 and the House 401 to 25." Bush not only accepted the cap, but he sided with environmentalists who wanted a larger cut than his own advisers, according to Smithsonian Magazine, in a report that detailed how the Environmental Defense Fund worked with Bush’s White House to make cap and trade a reality. "George H. W. Bush does indeed deserve enormous credit for being the champion of the cap and trade program for sulfur dioxide, a major cause of acid rain," Pooley said. "That has led many over the years to refer to it as a Republican idea." But Pooley said that Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell -- a Democrat -- also deserves credit for leading the legislative charge that ultimately passed by an overwhelming bipartisan majority. "So if pressed, I would call it a bipartisan idea that was championed by a Republican president," he told PolitiFact Florida. In 2005, the EPA under President George W. Bush issued the Clean Air Interstate Rule, which aimed to achieve "the largest reduction in air pollution in more than a decade" using cap and trade, wrote Stavins and Schmalensee. They noted the contributions under Reagan and both Bushes to argue that cap and trade should be embraced by Republicans as well as Democrats. "After all, these policies were innovations developed by conservatives in the Reagan, George H. W. Bush, and George W. Bush administrations (and once strongly condemned by liberals)," they wrote. In 2003, McCain, an Arizona Republican, and Sen. Joe Lieberman, then a Democrat from Connecticut, introduced the "Climate Stewardship Act," which would have used a similar cap and trade approach to reduce carbon pollution linked to global warming. Versions of the bill were reintroduced in 2005 and 2007. That was the first time legislation was introduced to use cap and trade for carbon emissions, Pooley told PolitiFact. "The enormous economic costs of damage caused by air pollution and greenhouse gas emissions to the environment and human health are not factored into the price of power produced by fossil-fueled technologies," McCain said in a floor speech to mark the bill’s 2007 introduction. "Yet, it’s a cost that we all bear, too often in terms of ill-health and diminished quality of life." McCain’s 2007 version was co-sponsored by Illinois Democratic Sen. Barack Obama. And both McCain and Obama had cap and trade programs in their presidential platforms. In June 2009, the Democrat-controlled House of Representatives passed a cap and trade bill, by a razor-thin margin, 219-212. But the bill failed to survive in the Senate amid Republican opposition. In 2011, the Republican-controlled House of Representatives has taken a firm stand against a cap and trade bill. "A full-blown fleecing of the middle class, it would raise electricity prices, increase gasoline prices, and ship American jobs to countries like China and India," wrote John Boehner, now the Speaker of the House, about the bill in June 2010. Our ruling Wasserman Schultz said that cap and trade legislation "was originally a Republican idea." Experts who have followed the history of the environmental policy focus on the fact that emissions trading to address acid rain became part of the Clean Air Act of 1990 under Bush. The legislation ultimately passed with bipartisan support under a Republican president. More recently, another prominent Republican -- McCain -- co-sponsored cap and trade legislation. Democrats did support cap and trade legislations at different points along the way. But we found a strong tradition of support from Republican presidents for cap and trade, which uses markets to try to reduce pollution. We rate this claim Mostly True.

pomt-14264	Says 80 journalists have been killed in Mexico in the last decade.	half-true	/texas/statements/2016/apr/08/jorge-ramos/jorge-ramos-echoes-count-80-journalists-killed-mex/	Before moderating the March 9, 2016 Washington Post-Univision Democratic presidential debate, journalist Jorge Ramos, a Univision news anchor who works out of Miami, met with NPR’s Steve Inskeep, to talk about "Take A Stand," his book recounting his experiences as a journalist. During the interview, Ramos commented on differences between being a reporter in the United States and Latin America. He noted the safety concerns of what it’s like to interview U.S. presidents versus presidents or dictators in Latin American countries. "When you have 80 journalists who have been killed in Mexico, for instance, in the last decade, yeah, you realize how lucky we are here in the United States in which you can go to the White House, talk to the president and go back to your house," Ramos said. "And then you can take a bike ride and go to the supermarket and no one is going to kill you. No one is going to do anything against you. That's a huge difference." It’s no secret: Mexico can be unsafe for journalists, including Americans. The Committee to Protect Journalists lists two cases of American journalists dying in Mexico in connection with their jobs. In 2006, Bradley Will, a freelance journalist, was shot while covering a protest. Before that, in 1998, San Antonio Express-News’ Mexico City correspondent Philip True was killed on a trail between remote villages while reporting on Huichol Indians. So, was Ramos right about the number of journalists lately felled in Mexico? That depends on who’s counting and if (or how) deaths are confirmed as work-connected. Ramos offers backup To our inquiry, Ramos said by phone that he mainly relied on nonprofits that gather such data such as the New York-based Committee to Protect Journalists, which promotes press freedom as it tracks journalist deaths, and the Paris-based Reporters Without Borders, which works for press freedom and tallies journalist deaths. We shortly learned that pinning down deaths in Mexico as journalism-related can be slippery. For starters, a person who declined to give her full name on the Reporters Without Borders’ Latin America desk emailed a list of 52 journalists it says it confirmed as killed in Mexico from 2006 into 2016 in connection with their work. Then again, Emmanuel Colombié, the head of Reporters Without Borders’ Latin America desk, said in an email that the group has previously gotten to a count of 80 deaths by counting all journalists killed in Mexico -- including those whose deaths weren't proved as work-related. Meantime, a list posted by the Committee to Protect Journalists indicates 62 journalist killings in Mexico from March 9, 2006 through Feb. 20, 2016. However, the committee says only 24 deaths were confirmed as occurring because of the victim’s work as a journalist. In those cases, the group says, they are "reasonably certain that a journalist was murdered in direct reprisal for his or her work; was killed in crossfire during combat situations; or was killed while carrying out a dangerous assignment such as coverage of a street protest." The other 38 deaths had unconfirmed motives, the committee says, meaning "it is possible that a journalist was killed because of his or her work." Carlos Lauría, the group’s New York-based Americas program coordinator, said by phone its "motive confirmed" estimates are likely more conservative than others, due to the group’s vetting. "I think that the complexity of the crisis in Mexico is so profound," Lauría said. "There are so many factors involved in some of these cases." Lauria said some such factors include things like whether the journalist was only working as a journalist and not holding other jobs or participating in activities that could cause a threat to his or her safety, if the reporter was working on issues that would put him or her at risk. Ramos also pointed to articles he’d seen with numbers around 80. One, published by Univision on Dec. 23, 2012 , says 82 journalists have been killed in the country since 2005, citing the Comisión Nacional de Derechos Humanos (CNDH), Mexico’s national human rights commission. Others from CNN Mexico and El Universal, a newspaper in Mexico, both citing Reporters Without Borders, put the count at or over 80 – though we noticed these reported figures didn’t reflect the group’s lower tallies as of April 2016. Other analyses Our hunt for additional research yielded a couple lists delivering a total close to what Ramos declared. But counts vary. To get started, we turned to the Knight Center for Journalism in the Americas at the University of Texas where Teresa Mioli guided us to recommended organizations offering counts suggesting 60 to 89 journalists had been killed in Mexico since 2006. By email, Mioli advised that variations in counts reflect different filters used by groups to classify deaths. "For example," Mioli wrote, "some organizations only count journalists who were killed because of their work, while others also include journalists killed during protests or in combat. Some also count journalists who are in car accidents on their way to cover a story or who are killed while at work. "The numbers may also vary," Mioli wrote, "because one organization only counts journalists, while another counts all media workers. And finally, sometimes it's difficult to determine if the journalist was killed because of their investigations or opinions, for a reason unrelated to their work or if they are a random victim of a crime, especially in countries where violence is more rampant." Generally, it’s worth noting, the definition of journalist includes reporters, broadcasters, editors, photographers and others involved in news-gathering: On the high end, the International Federation of Journalists, a group that "monitors press freedom violations" and releases an annual report on journalists and media staff killed, says there were 89 journalist deaths in Mexico from March 9, 2006 through Feb. 9, 2016, as well as the 2007 death of a driver. The group says it looks at cases that "include targeted killings, crossfire lethal incidents as well as work-related accidents which result in loss of life." Artículo 19 Mexico, a group that says it promotes and defends freedom of expression, pointed us to its own infographic identifying 76 journalists killed in Mexico, possibly in connection with their work, from January 6, 2006 through Feb. 20, 2016. Single-year highs of 10 were killed in both 2006 and 2008 with fewer felled in other years; as few as three were taken down in 2007 and the first part of 2016, according to the graphic. Sandra Patargo, deputy officer of the Protection Program of Artículo 19 Mexico, explained by phone that the group requires at least three sources – such as a family member, a boss or coworkers – to confirm a death was related to the victim's work as a journalist. The International Press Institute, a network of global media professionals, produces a yearly "Death Watch" of journalists "deliberately targeted because of their profession." We sifted the lists and counted 62 deaths of journalists in Mexico from March 9, 2006 through May 2, 2015, the latest date shown for Mexico. UNESCO identifies 60 journalists killed from March 14, 2006 through Feb. 20, 2016 when, it says, a radio "presenter," Moisés Dagdug Lutzow, was killed. Source of Tally Journalists Killed in Mexico International Federation of Journalists 89 March 9, 2006 to Feb. 9, 2016 Artículo 19 Mexico 76 Jan. 6, 2006 to Feb. 20, 2016 International Press Institute 62 March 9, 2006 to May 2, 2015 UNESCO 60 March 14, 2006 to Feb. 20, 2016 Committee to Protect Journalists (Death related to job confirmed) 24 Oct. 27, 2006 to Jan. 21, 2016 Committee to Protect Journalists (Death related to job unconfirmed) 38 March 9, 2006 to Feb. 20, 2016 Reporters Without Borders (Death related to job confirmed) 52 March 9, 2006 to Feb. 20, 2016 SOURCES: Emails, telephone interviews and lists and reports posted online (received, conducted and accessed by PolitiFact Texas March-April 2016) Merging lists Next, we made a run at merging the lists, bringing together every name to find there may have been more than 100 journalists killed in Mexico from 2006 into the first part of 2016. We’d caution, though, that we didn’t judge how many died in connection with their work. We lack that expertise. When we circled back to Ramos, he agreed some of the published counts didn’t match his declared "80." We noted that all told, there may be considerably fewer journalist deaths over the decade confirmed as work-related. By email, Ramos replied: "The fact is that Mexico is an incredibly dangerous country to be a journalist." Whatever the exact count, we’re not discounting any of the enumerated deaths. A little perspective: According to CPJ, three journalists were killed in the U.S. from 2006 through 2015 in connection with their work. Our ruling Ramos, expressing safety concerns about Mexico, said 80 journalists were killed there in the last decade. Our merger of lists from watchdog groups suggests that more than 100 people connected to journalism (not all of them journalists) died in the country from 2006 into 2016. But Ramos was clearly speaking to journalists killed at, or due to, their work. Apply that filter and the count diminishes to as few as 24 deaths confirmed as related to reporting work though we also gathered counts of 52 to 89, perhaps an indication different groups take considerably different approaches. No doubt, journalists in Mexico can face peril. But a decade-long count of killings is not as straightforward as Ramos’ figure would suggest. We rate his statement Half True.

pomt-09870	"The John McCain Twitter account has more than 1.1 million followers. The official White House Twitter account has only about 830,000."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/aug/04/john-king/cnns-king-doesnt-provide-full-count-obama-twitter-/	Flash back to the 2008 campaign and you might recall a technology gap between Barack Obama and John McCain. Obama was portrayed as the youthful candidate of change whose campaign harnessed the Internet in ways no candidate had before. McCain was the senior statesman, a veteran senator and former POW . . . but not someone who was checking his BlackBerry 24/7. The Obama campaign poked fun at McCain with an ad titled "1982" that portrayed him as an out-of-touch old guy. "Things have changed in the last 26 years. But McCain hasn't," the announcer said as the screen flashed images flash of a record player and a Rubik's Cube. "He admits he still doesn't know how to use a computer, can't send an e-mail," the announcer said. We rated that claim Mostly True because it was based on McCain's comments in an interview with journalist Mike Allen. So imagine our surprise when we heard John King of CNN say in an interview with McCain that the Arizona Republican actually has more Twitter followers than the Obama White House. Here's the exchange: KING: "I'll close with this one. The John McCain Twitter account has more than 1.1 million followers. The official White House Twitter account has only about 830,000 as of last count. Is it time to replace the Electoral College with the Twitter count?" MCCAIN: "It is a phenomenal way of communicating." We checked the Twitter pages and found King is correct about those counts. McCain's page, @SenJohnMcCain (A recent tweet: "Fighting to remove two more pork barrel projects totaling $24.5 million - we will probably lose, again, because it's business as usual in DC") had 1,128,161 followers. The White House account, @whitehouse , had 860,835 (Recent tweet: "Don't believe everything you see on the web about health insurance reform . . . "). But there's a significant caveat to King's statement: Obama has a second Twitter account that was created during the campaign and is now handled by the Democratic National Committee. That one, @barackobama , had 1,902,667 followers. So add them together and Obama has nearly triple McCain's followers. One of King's producers correctly noted the caveat in an article on the CNN Web site, but King did not mention it during the interview. So King is correct with his claim that McCain beats the official White House Twitter account, but viewers might be misled to think that's the total count for Obama when in fact it's just one of his two accounts. So we'll take King down a notch and give him a Mostly True.	None	John King	None	None	None	2009-08-04T17:29:57	2009-08-02	['None']
pomt-02512	"Six people in Florida die as a result of (not expanding Medicaid) every day."	half-true	/florida/statements/2014/feb/12/charlie-crist/charlie-crist-says-six-floridians-die-day-due-lack/	Former Florida Gov. Charlie Crist, now running for his old position as a Democrat, has attacked Republican Gov. Rick Scott for his tepid support for Medicaid expansion last year. Scott had said he would support it, but he didn’t lobby for it, and ultimately the state Legislature rejected the expansion. In a Feb. 7 interview on MSNBC’s The Daily Rundown, Crist said that means "about 1 million of my fellow Floridians are not getting health care today, and I’m told by my friends at (the Service Employees International Union) that means that six people in Florida die as a result of that every day." Is Crist’s diagnosis correct? Do six Floridians die a day because the Legislature rejected Medicaid expansion? The Health Affairs study Crist’s claim comes from a study released in late January on the blog of the health-policy journal Health Affairs. It was authored by researchers from Harvard University and the City University of New York. The researchers looked at states that had opted out of Medicaid expansion, including Florida, where about 1.27 million people would have been eligible. Researchers then used prior studies about the effects of expanding insurance to estimate a low-end number and a high-end number of deaths for each state that didn’t expand Medicaid. In Florida, the study concluded, the number of deaths would range from 1,158 to 2,221. The only state with more projected deaths was Texas. Crist arrived at his six-deaths-a-day figure for Florida by using the high end of the range cited in the study -- 2,221 deaths divided by 365 days a year works out to six deaths a day. If he had used the low-end figure, it would have worked out to three deaths per day. So what were the underlying studies? They were: • The Oregon Health Insurance Experiment, a comparison of about 6,000 patients who got a slot in a 2008 Medicaid expansion and about 6,000 who didn’t. The study tracked factors such as blood pressure, cholesterol, blood sugar, depression, and out-of-pocket medical spending. (PolitiFact has previously written about the mixed results of the health outcomes found in the Oregon study.) • A study by Harvard researchers Benjamin D. Sommers and Katherine Baicker compared three states that expanded Medicaid -- New York, Maine and Arizona -- with neighboring states that didn’t expand it. This is what the Harvard/CUNY researchers used to calculate their high estimate of deaths and was published in the New England Journal of Medicine in 2012. The sample consisted of adults who were observed five years before and after the expansions, from 1997 through 2007. • A study by Harvard researchers about health insurance and deaths. This produced the low-deaths estimate. The study was published in 2009 in the American Journal of Public Health; it followed indivduals over 16 years. (Two of the authors of this study are also authors of the new Harvard/CUNY study.) The Harvard/CUNY study arrived at the death figures by looking at the number of individuals with depression, the number of patients on diabetic medications, the number of women who had a mammogram or pap smear in the past year and the number of people who had catastrophic medical expenses in the past year. We interviewed two of the authors of the study, including Harvard professor Danny McCormick. The lack of Medicaid expansion will mean that patients nationwide won’t get certain diagnostic tests or take certain medications. "Cumulatively, that amounts to vast numbers of deaths," McCormick said. We asked McCormick how researchers can know that the differences in the death rates between the Medicaid expansion states and the states that didn’t expand were as a result of Medicaid. "We don’t know absolutely because we didn’t do a randomized control trial with long-term followup on millions of people," McCormick said. "For $10 billion we could do that study." Experts weigh in on study We asked a variety of health policy experts their opinion about Crist’s claim. Many experts told PolitiFact that denying Medicaid to poor Floridians will harm their health. But placing a precise figure as to how many will die per day, they added, is difficult. "There is strong consensus in the public health community that this is a very harmful policy," said Harold Pollack, who told PolitiFact he is a "liberal health policy wonk" at the University of Chicago. However "the most difficult aspect of that policy to investigate is its effect on mortality." Pollack said Crist is on solid ground to point out that the lack of Medicaid expansion causes serious harm. However, "I personally believe that these mortality estimates were on the high side of an inherently difficult calculation." Pollack pointed to a 2009 study by Richard Kronick, then a University of California San Diego medical professor who later went to work for the Department of Health and Human Services in the Obama administration. His study concluded that the risk of mortality is no different for uninsured respondents than those covered by employer-sponsored group insurance. Uninsured individuals can still get some health care, but they use fewer services than the insured, which increases their risk, said Jonathan Oberlander, who studies health care politics and policy at the University of North Carolina. "There are different estimates in the literature of how much uninsurance increases mortality (and at least one significant study that doesn’t confirm that claim)," Oberlander told PolitiFact. "But in general I’d say that former Gov. Crist is on solid ground in saying that Florida's decision to not expand Medicaid could lead to more deaths from uninsured Floridians, which could have been reduced if the state expands Medicaid. However, getting an exact number is difficult. There are estimates, and the Health Affairs study is just one estimate." Some of the criticisms we heard focused on shortcomings of the underlying studies. George Washington University professor Leighton Ku said that the Sommers/Baicker study looking at the mortality in a few states was "relatively rigorous" but warned that it came with caveats. The authors wrote acknowledged that it may not be possible to generalize its findings to other states. Also the study states that it "cannot definitively show causality." "It makes sense to believe that giving low-income people Medicaid health insurance coverage will lead to improved health access and improved health and could eventually reduce mortality," Ku told PolitiFact in an email. "But it is important to recognize that it might take a number of years before such an effect is realized." Ku said that the new Medicaid death study "is somewhat speculative, but plausible. It did not go through the more rigorous peer review that would normally be required to be published in a peer-reviewed journal. I think there is pretty good evidence that Medicaid saves lives, but how many and how long it takes is a little harder to say." Other scholars are more critical of the study. Duke University professor Chris Conover, an adjunct scholar at the conservative American Enterprise Institute, said the study of three states only found a statistically significant decrease in mortality in New York and that the New York benefits are more generous than most states. The study, he said, doesn’t prove that the reasons for the differences between mortality in New York (which expanded Medicaid) and Pennsylvania (which didn’t) result from differing approaches to expanding Medicaid. "If people are willing to overlook the study’s clear methodological limitations to claim it ‘proves’ Medicaid saved lives in New York, then they have to be prepared to concede that Maine and Arizona’s Medicaid programs evidently had no impact on mortality," Conover wrote in his blog. Baicker, author of one of the underlying studies, said that the new study is "a blog post (rather than a refereed article), so I really can't speak to the quality of methods they use." "The point of most studies like this is to take estimates of the effect of a particular program and forecast what would happen to a population overall based on those estimates," Baicker said. "All such estimates come with uncertainty, and don't point to the specific individuals or, for example, specific times of death." Our ruling Crist said that Florida’s decision not to expand Medicaid means that "six people in Florida die as a result of that every day." The statistic is based on a recent study, but experts note a few caveats. First, Crist used the study’s high-end figure; using the low-end figure cuts the number of deaths to three a day. Second, experts caution about uncertainties about the studies upon which the new study was based. And third, while many experts agree that it’s plausible to assume that the lack of Medicaid coverage could lead to deaths, they were careful to add that it is difficult to pinpoint a number as precise as the one Crist offered. On balance, we rate this claim Half True.	None	Charlie Crist	None	None	None	2014-02-12T11:50:00	2014-02-07	['None']
pomt-05759	"We have 395 inmates pushed into triple-bunked cells intended for two inmates and bunked in classrooms and areas supposed to be designated for inmate labor."	false	/oregon/statements/2012/mar/01/ken-allen/are-there-395-oregon-prisoners-triple-bunked-cells/	Oregon’s budget writers tossed around the idea of closing the Santiam Correctional Institution south of Salem to balance the budget. State leaders agreed to leave the prison alone, but that doesn’t mean we can’t fact check a statement made by labor leader Ken Allen in a guest column submitted to The Oregonian. Allen is executive director of Oregon Council 75 of the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees, the union that represents most corrections employees. He said closing the prison would send 440 minimum-security inmates to other prisons, overcrowding an already overcrowded situation. "We have 395 inmates pushed into triple-bunked cells intended for two inmates and bunked in classrooms and areas supposed to be designated for inmate labor," he wrote. "We have units that were designated for 80 inmates with 120 inmates, with only one corrections officer supervising these inmates. We have units with blind spots, including no sightline to the bathroom, with only one corrections officer supervising 80 to 100 inmates." Oh wow. That sounded pretty dire. Was Allen being alarmist? Or are Oregon’s prisons that stuffed? There are lots of details in the column, but we zeroed in on the 395-inmate figure: Are there 395 inmates pushed into triple-bunked cells intended for two people and bunked in classrooms or work spaces? The Department of Corrections confirmed there are 395 emergency beds currently in use, but the beds are not in standard sized cells meant for two people. Also, those beds are not currently in classroom or work areas, although there were plans to do just that should Santiam close. "We do not put three inmates into the standard-sized cell," said Jennifer Black, a spokeswoman for the agency. We asked Corrections to break down the location of the 395 beds, and in the process, we learned quite a bit about prison housing in Oregon. Inmates are housed in cells or in open sleeping areas much like camp. A standard-sized cell is about 8 feet by 10 feet, or 80 square feet, and designed to hold two inmates. Mill Creek: There are 50 emergency beds here, 25 each added to two large dorms. Columbia River: There are 40 emergency beds, added to different dorm housing units. Snake River: There are 80 emergency beds scattered among minimum-security and medium-security open dorm rooms. Deer Ridge: There are 116 emergency beds, divided among four minimum-security dorm units. Each unit used to hold 108 beds; now each unit holds 137 beds. Eastern Oregon: There are 52 emergency beds, with roughly half in open dorm rooms. The individual rooms at this former mental health facility are larger, which is why you can squeeze in more beds. Eight individual rooms that are 7 feet by 19 feet, or 133 square feet, got a third bed. Eight more rooms that are 7 feet by 24 feet, or 168 square feet, each received two extra beds. Coffee Creek: There are emergency 57 beds, added to three minimum-custody open dorm areas. So that adds up to 395 beds. Nathan Allen, budget and planning administrator for the agency, said he did not know of any of those beds in current classroom or work areas, although such spaces have been converted in the past into housing units. "It’s inaccurate because none of the 395 meet that picture, that scenario," said Guy Hall, administrator of the Office of Population Management. Next, we turned to AFSCME. Tim Woolery is the union’s staff representative for Corrections. Before that, he was a Corrections employee for 18 years and in that time has seen cots lined up in unimaginable spots when the population ran high. Woolery said they can’t add any more beds without compromising security or safety. "We’re at the precipice." Still -- and this is important -- Woolery acknowledged that he doesn’t know where the 395 beds are located. Don Loving, spokesman for AFSCME, said he doesn’t know how else to prove the case other than what they’ve seen themselves or what they’ve been told by officers. "It is hard for us to ‘prove’ some things because the DOC is never going to publicly admit anything that contradicts its official position," Loving said. Are there safety issues? Yes. Adding bunks to units could interfere with the line of sight for guards. Has Corrections housed inmates in work areas in the past and could it in the future? Yes. Nathan Allen said that the next wave of emergency beds could use classroom space at one of the prisons. Had Santiam closed, one of the options was to put beds into a recreation area at Deer Ridge. At Two Rivers, there is an 88-bed unit in a space that could have been used for work training. The statement gives the impression that trios of inmates are crammed into tiny cells. That is not true. Allen states that the 395 inmates have spilled into work areas and classroom space. That also is not true, with respect to this batch of 395 beds. We give Ken Allen and AFSCME credit on the broader issue of inmate housing. Work areas have been converted into housing in the past. The closure of Santiam would have prompted more conversions. There may be more teaching and work space converted to housing in the future. And a handful of beds -- 24 -- were added to rooms that typically house two inmates.

pomt-09510	In the stimulus, "$15 million dollars went to 'build a bigger, better airport' for the town of Ouzinkie, Alaska, population 165."	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/feb/19/john-boehner/boehner-claims-15-million-stimulus-going-alaskan-a/	In an address on the anniversary of the economic stimulus, President Barack Obama boasted that despite the massive and rapid spending in the $862 billion package, you're not hearing about money being misspent. "I was still concerned -- Joe (Biden) and I were just talking in the back -- when this thing passed we said $787 billion -- somewhere there’s going to be some story of some money that ended up being misspent; $787 billion spent out over 18 months, that's a lot -- that's a lot of money," Obama said. "And it is a testimony to Vice President Biden and his team that, as Joe puts it, the dog, so far at least, hasn't barked." On the same day Obama made his speech, House Republican Leader John Boehner issued a press release saying the stimulus is "chock-full of wasteful government spending." And he attached a list of 19 "real world" examples. We looked at several of the items on this list to see if they were as billed. Here, we will examine the claim that "$15 million (in stimulus) dollars went to 'build a bigger, better airport' for the town of Ouzinkie, Alaska, population 165." This project landed in the national spotlight when it was singled out in a CBS Evening News report on July 13, 2009. "That's roughly $90,000 dollars per resident," the report said. "Consider that Los Angeles International doesn't have the money to install critical taxiway warning lights," the CBS report states. "And a third of the nation's largest airports -- 11 of the 30 biggest, handling over one-fourth of the nation's passenger traffic -- have substandard safety areas for when planes veer off the runway." A lengthier story three days later in the Kodiak (Alaska) Daily Mirror included some defense of the project. To put the project in perspective, some locals said, you have to understand Ouzinkie, and the importance of air travel. Ouzinkie is a small, island village peopled predominantly by Native Alaskans called Alutiiq. Or as ProPublica.org put it in an article titled Tiny Airports Take Off With Stimulus: "The village of Ouzinkie is one of the remotest outposts in the United States — home to a mere 165 people on an island off another island off the coast of Alaska. There are no stores, no gas stations and no stoplights." Because of its remoteness, villagers depend on its airport as a lifeline for mail, medical evacuations and supplies. The location of the existing airport, local officials told the Kodiak Daily Mirror, is exposed to fierce crosswinds that often make it impossible for planes to take off and land, and the site does not meet FAA-mandated runway length. The new project includes a runway, taxiway, airport lights, a snow removal equipment building and 2 miles of access road. "I’m sorry the airport has to cost so much, but essential services are essential air services," Ouzinkie Vice Mayor Tom Quick told the Kodiak Daily Mirror. "They are essential, whether you’re talking about five people or 5,000." Quick also said planes have been much more convenient in transporting the dead, who otherwise were transported via skiff. "I feel this is very necessary in case somebody needs to get a medevac out," added Jill Boskofsky, vice president of the Ouzinkie Tribal Council and environmental director. "I feel it's for the safety of our community." In an opinion piece for the Anchorage Press, Krestia DeGeorge called the CBS report "sensationalizing" and told people to "quit picking on Ouzinkie." Airports in Alaska are a more important part of the basic transportation system than they are elsewhere, she wrote, and, "The point is that we should think carefully about what’s really involved before criticizing something. ... Otherwise (things) such as Ouzinkie’s lifeline will continue to be someone else’s taxpayer waste." On this one, Boehner has his facts straight. It's worth noting that the one-sentence synopsis of the project leaves out important contextual information, such as how important a lifeline an airport is to this small island community. But Boehner is right. And so we rule his statement True.	None	John Boehner	None	None	None	2010-02-19T17:36:57	2010-02-19	['Alaska']
pomt-05471	"President Obama's suggested reduction in spending for next year: $0."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/apr/20/mitt-romney/mitt-romney-says-barack-obamas-suggested-reduction/	In an effort to relate the federal budget to a typical family’s budget, the Mitt Romney presidential campaign posted an explanatory graphic on April 17, 2012. It concludes with this claim "President Obama's suggested reduction in spending for next year: $0." We decided to see whether that’s accurate. As its source, the graphic pointed to Obama’s budget proposal for fiscal year 2013. This document, produced annually, is usually considered an opening volley rather than a final set of numbers, particularly when the president and Congress are controlled by different parties. Congress typically gives little deference to the president’s budget request. Still, as a summary of the president’s fiscal priorities, it’s reasonable for Romney to use it in the way it did. The question is whether Obama did propose no net reduction in spending for 2013 compared to 2012. Indeed, Romney has a point. According to Obama’s proposal, overall federal outlays would increase from $3.796 trillion in fiscal year 2012 to $3.803 trillion in fiscal 2013. That’s an increase -- though a modest one. It’s a rise of two-tenths of 1 percent of all federal outlays, which is likely to fall well short of the inflation rate. But an important detail is missing: Obama doesn't have much control over the parts of the budget that are increasing -- the "mandatory spending" and net interest. Mandatory spending includes entitlements such as Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid. Their annual costs are determined by automatic formulas rather than congressional appropriations. Meanwhile, net interest is what the nation pays on its outstanding debt. Collectively, mandatory spending and net interest account for about 65 percent of federal outlays in 2012. The remaining 35 percent is considered discretionary spending -- funds that are appropriated by Congress and signed by the president on an annual basis. This part of the budget includes all the other functions of government that aren’t determined by a formula. Under the president’s budget, mandatory spending plus net interest -- the costs that are largely set by formula and debt commitments -- are poised to rise from $2.477 trillion to $2.541 trillion between 2012 and 2013, an increase of about 2.5 percent. But discretionary spending -- again, the part he has more control over -- would actually decline from $1.319 trillion to $1.261 trillion, a drop of 4.3 percent. So by this measure, Obama is suggesting cuts in his budget proposal. Our ruling Romney claims that the president’s "suggested reduction in spending for next year" is zero. Romney's claim ignores the detail that Obama proposed cuts in the discretionary portion of the budget, which he has more control over. The increases come from mandatory spending and net interest. Still, Obama could propose cuts in mandatory spending if he wanted. The statement is accurate but needs clarification. We rate it Mostly True.

pomt-14468	"Since (welfare reform) was signed into law, the number of families living in extreme poverty has more than doubled."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/mar/02/bernie-sanders/sanders-welfare-reform-more-doubled-extreme-povert/	One thing that sets Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders apart from opponent Hillary Clinton is that he opposed a 1996 law known widely as welfare reform. The Vermont senator said the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Act, which both Democratic President Bill Clinton and a bipartisan Congress supported, contributed to poverty today. "What welfare reform did, in my view, was go after some of the weakest and most vulnerable people in this country," Sanders said at a Feb. 24 press conference in South Carolina. "During that time, I spoke out against so-called welfare reform because I thought it was scapegoating people who were helpless, people who were very, very vulnerable. Secretary Clinton at that time had a very different position on welfare reform. ... Now what happened as a result of that so-called welfare reform bill? Since legislation was signed into law, the number of families living in extreme poverty has more than doubled from 636,000 to 1.6 million." We wondered if the number of families living in extreme poverty — defined as households living on less than $2 in cash per person per day — has more than doubled, and we also wanted to know if the 1996 legislation caused that trend. We found that the best estimates show Sanders’ numbers are right on, and there is some well-regarded research that ties welfare reform to the rise in extreme poverty. The numbers Sanders’ campaign pointed us to figures from the Census’ Survey of Income and Program Participation, which researchers Kathryn Edin and Luke Shaefer examined in their 2015 book, $2.00 a Day: Living on Almost Nothing in America. When welfare reform passed in 1996, there were about 636,000 American households living on $2 per person per day or less. As of mid 2013, that figure has more than doubled, to about 1.5 million such households, with about 3 million children living in these circumstances. That’s a 130 percent growth in families in extreme poverty, compared to just about 20 percent growth in the population as a whole. This data has some shortcomings, acknowledged by Edin and Shaefer, professors at Johns Hopkins University and the University of Michigan, respectively. For example, there are concerns that survey respondents misreport how much cash assistance they receive from the government, which could mean that some of these households actually have cash income higher than $2 a day. Additionally, SIPP only counts cash income, so it doesn’t capture whether these families receive in-kind government benefits like food stamps, Medicaid, child day care or subsidized housing. Even if the SIPP data isn’t perfect, Edin and Shaefer found that the general trend was consistent with corresponding data, such as an increase in those reporting zero income among people receiving benefits from the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, known colloquially as SNAP or food stamps. In any case, by a reasonable measure, Sanders’ figures are correct. The causes What was welfare reform? The bipartisan legislation sought to encourage the poor to join the workforce and stay there. It responded to a sense that welfare recipients were choosing government cash over getting a job. The law put a five-year lifetime limit on receiving welfare cash, established as Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF), and it established workforce participation requirements. The previous program had no such requirements. Welfare reform, combined with earned income tax credit expansions and a booming economy, benefited the working poor, experts told us. But the instability of the low-wage market revealed the program to be an ineffective safety net for people who weren't able to find and keep work, Edin and Shaefer found. They aren’t able to maintain a stable earned income, and as a result they cannot reap the benefits of a work-based safety net and the earned income tax credit. "We believe a lot of families are better off as a result of the package of changes made during the 1990s, in particular the EITC," Shaefer told PolitiFact. "Those who are able to maintain employment, buffer against the instability, receive more assistance than ever before. It’s those at the very bottom that we argue are doing worse." Just 23 out of every 100 people living in poverty receive welfare cash, as of 2014, and that ratio has dropped nearly every year since 1996 when it was 68 out of 100, according to the left-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. People living in extreme poverty might not be taking advantage of welfare cash benefits because of the stigma, lack of confidence in the program, or the work requirements and time limits, contributing to some families’ extremely low cash income. Welfare reform put TANF administration into the hands of the states in the form of block grants. This means that states can use the funding for cash benefits or for administering programs intended to increase employment, like childcare or job training. But there is wide variation between the states as a result. For example, in 2013, 78 out of 100 impoverished families in Vermont received cash benefits, but just 4 out of 100 did in Louisiana. Shaefer said some states use these block grants to pay for programs they would have paid for absent the federal funds, leading to less cash in the hands of individuals. Certain states and the 1996 legislation for structuring welfare in such a way are both responsible for these state-level shortcomings, said Ron Haskins, who was involved in crafting welfare reform and is now codirector of the Brookings Center on Children and Families. There are other factors affecting this upward trend in extreme poverty, including broader economic trends affecting low-wage employment and housing stability, Edin and Schaefer note. But there’s no doubt that welfare reform played a role. "I think welfare reform was one major factor driving the increase in extreme poverty and probably the biggest single factor, although it’s harder to be sure about the second claim," said Christopher Jencks, professor of social policy at Harvard University. Though acknowledging extremely poor people who are unable to maintain a job would have been better off under the pre-reform system, Haskins said Sanders is ignoring all the positive benefits of welfare reform. For example, poverty among single-mother households, which were most affected by by welfare reform, is lower than what it was prior to welfare reform, even during the Great Recession. "Sanders is onto something, but he only told half the story," Haskins said. Our ruling Sanders said, "Since (welfare reform) was signed into law, the number of families living in extreme poverty has more than doubled." Sanders is talking about a very specific and small percentage of American households living on less than $2 cash income per person per day. That figure has more than doubled from 636,000 to 1.5 million since 1996 when Bill Clinton signed welfare reform. The data isn’t a perfect capture of how much these people receive in government benefits, and only so much blame can be placed on welfare reform legislation. But experts told us the law did play a significant role in this trend. We rate Sanders’ claim Mostly True.	None	Bernie Sanders	None	None	None	2016-03-02T17:30:34	2016-02-24	['None']
pomt-13747	"An analysis showed that Bernie Sanders would have won the Democratic nomination if it were not for the Super Delegates."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/jul/25/donald-trump/no-donald-trump-bernie-sanders-wouldnt-have-won-ev/	Donald Trump fired off a series of tweets about Bernie Sanders over the weekend, at times commiserating with the senator over their shared disdain for the "rigged" political system and at others attacking Sanders for giving into it by endorsing Hillary Clinton. The Republican nominee commented on Wikileaks’ release of Democratic National Committee emails in which officials appear to have, among other things, mused over questioning Sanders’ religion and attacked campaign manager Jeff Weaver. "An analysis showed that Bernie Sanders would have won the Democratic nomination if it were not for the Super Delegates," he tweeted. This last Trump tweet piqued our interest. Would it really be Sanders accepting the nomination this week at the DNC if not for superdelegates? Superdelegates, if you’ll remember from our primer, are the party officials and bigshots who make up about one-sixth of the delegates in the Democratic Party’s system. Under the rules that governed this year’s primaries, the superdelegates weren’t bound to the voting results in their state and could vote for whomever they wish. Many superdelegates backed Clinton before voting even began, and she commanded a disproportionate lead in superdelegates throughout the primaries, eliciting many cries of unfairness and cronyism from voters and Sanders supporters. But Trump is wrong. Sanders would not have won the primary without these party insiders. The Trump campaign didn’t get back to us, but the "analysis" he may have been referring to could be a blog post on Gateway Pundit, a conservative newsblog. The post’s headline is "NOTE TO SANDERS SUPPORTERS: Bernie Would Have Won If Not for Super Delegate System!" It makes a flawed argument that Sanders would have nabbed the nomination if all of the Clinton superdelegates backed him instead. That math checks out on paper, but it is nonsensical in reality. The post offers no rationale for why the superdelegates should flip their votes against the popular vote (Clinton won 3.8 million more than Sanders). Experts told PolitiFact Florida that superdelegates could have played a difference if the race was closer. And to top it off, Sanders himself repeatedly advocated for superdelegates to follow the will of their state’s voters. In other scenarios, such as binding superdelegates to their state’s vote proportionally or taking them out of the system all together, Sanders would have still been unable to reach the magical 2,383-threshold of delegates needed to capture the nomination and would still trail Clinton. Here’s a breakdown of how many superdelegates Clinton and Sanders would have received under different primary systems, based on Green Papers’ superdelegate count. Clinton Total (superdelegates) Sanders Total (superdelegates) Without superdelegates (Trump suggestion) 2,200 1,831 With unbound superdelegates (current system) 2,771 (571) 1,875 (44) With winner-take-all superdelegates 2,721 (521) 2,019 (188) With proportional allocation of superdelegates 2,590 (390) 2,150 (319) (A note about our delegate methodology: Delegate counts vary from publication to publication, so we used Real Clear Politics and Green Papers, sources listed by the Gateway Pundit blog post. While RCP offers a superdelegate count, it does not offer state-by-state breakdowns so we referred to Green Papers for its superdelegate breakdown.) The bottom line: Binding the superdelegates to the winner of their state’s primary or caucus would have closed the delegate gap between Clinton and Sanders, but it wouldn’t have been enough for Sanders to win. Our ruling Trump tweeted, "An analysis showed that Bernie Sanders would have won the Democratic nomination if it were not for the Super Delegates." This does not check out. Sanders would have still lost without superdelegates in the mix, because Clinton won a majority of the popular vote and pledged delegates. On the contrary, the only way for Sanders to have won is he would have been able to persuade more superdelegates to switch their votes from Clinton to him. We rate Trump’s claim False. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/9cef5e9e-9758-42ad-845d-6f13189a554e	None	Donald Trump	None	None	None	2016-07-25T15:43:46	2016-07-24	['Bernie_Sanders', 'Democratic_Party_(United_States)', 'Superdelegate']
pomt-12708	The GOP health care plan gives "$275 billion in tax breaks for the top 2 percent, people earning $250,000 a year or more."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2017/mar/09/bernie-sanders/sanders-gop-health-care-plan-gives-wealthiest-275-/	Sen Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., put a different spin on the Republican House’s plan to overhaul the health care system. Speaking on MSNBC, Sanders said the House plan isn’t really a health care plan at all. It’s a tax cut package, he says, that overwhelmingly helps the wealthy. "Look at it as a tax plan with $275 billion in tax breaks for the top 2 percent, people earning $250,000 a year or more," Sanders said on All In With Chris Hayes March 8. He said the change amounted to a transfer of wealth from working families to the wealthiest. Is that true? Sanders’ office told us they got their tax numbers from the Joint Committee on Taxation, a congressional committee that lawmakers rely on for core fiscal data. The committee estimated the impact of repealing two taxes on the wealthy in the Affordable Care Act. One is a 0.9 percent payroll tax on earnings and the other is a 3.8 percent tax on net investment income for individuals with incomes over $200,000 and couples with incomes over $250,000. In the decade between 2017 and 2026, the committee said dropping both measures would cut taxes by $274.9 billion. The Tax Policy Center, a joint fiscal analysis project of the Brookings Institution and the Urban Institute, confirmed Sanders’ number for the total tax cut. Two caveats First, Sanders’ fixation on the top 2 percent is not quite right. According to the latest survey from the U.S. Census Bureau, households making $250,000 and above accounted for the top 4.4 percent. Sanders’ office cited an op-ed from two advocacy groups that asserted that those making that much fell into the top 2 percent. Second, Gordon Mermin, a senior research associate at the Tax Policy Center, said Sanders left out a couple of "nuances." The House Republican plan includes other forms of tax relief that will benefit a broader swath of Americans. "Repealing ACA taxes delivers small tax cuts to most people throughout the income distribution," Mermin said. Plus, he added, removing the tax penalty for failing to buy insurance would benefit people regardless of income, though for low and moderate income families, "the overall average impact is small," Mermin said. Our ruling Sanders said that the Republican House health care plan would cut taxes on the wealthiest 2 percent by $275 billion. While Sanders didn’t specify the time frame, that is a 10-year estimate from a neutral congressional committee. Estimates that look a decade ahead are typical in budgeting circles. The one point where Sanders erred most was in labeling the affected taxpayers as the "top 2 percent." According to government data, a more accurate number is 4.4 percent. But that’s still a small sliver of the population. We rate this claim Mostly True.

pomt-10060	Democrats compare the infrastructure programs in the stimulus to the Eisenhower interstate program, "but he proposed a $500 billion highway system, and they're going to put $30 billion" into roads and bridges.	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/jan/28/john-mica/mica-correct-roads-and-bridges-are-small-part-stim/	In making their case for the economic stimulus bill, President Obama and Democrats in Congress have been saying the bill will make an investment in the nation's infrastructure similar to President Eisenhower's creation of the interstate highway system in the 1950s. When Obama gave an initial outline of the stimulus plan in a radio/YouTube address on Dec. 6, 2008, he said it would include a significant investment in the highway system. "We will create millions of jobs by making the single largest new investment in our national infrastructure since the creation of the federal highway system in the 1950s," he said, referring to the interstate system launched by President Eisenhower. "We’ll invest your precious tax dollars in new and smarter ways, and we’ll set a rule — use it or lose it. If a state doesn’t act quickly to invest in roads and bridges in their communities, they’ll lose the money." Obama also invoked Eisenhower during a Dec. 19, 2008, news conference in Chicago: "Our economy boomed in the 20th century when President Eisenhower remade the American landscape by building the interstate highway system. Now we need to remake our transportation system for the 21st century." The Ike comparisons have irked Rep. John Mica of Florida, the top Republican on the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee. In a comment to the Washington Post published Jan. 28, 2009, Mica complained that the highway portion of the stimulus was small change compared with the cost of the 1950s program. Mica said the proposed infrastructure spending was "almost minuscule" in the $825 billion stimulus bill and said he was disappointed the transportation portion was not based on an ambitious goal such as building high-speed rail lines. "They keep comparing this to Eisenhower, but he proposed a $500 billion highway system, and they're going to put $30 billion" in roads and bridges, Mica said. "How farcical can you be? Give me a break." So let's check Mica's numbers. First, Mica is correct that the highway portion of the stimulus is $30 billion, according to the House Appropriations Committee summary of the bill. As for the Eisenhower system, the number went up as the system grew. When Ike proposed the program in 1955, he wrote Congress that, "Our unity as a nation is secured by free communication of thought and by easy transportation of people and goods." (The original letter provided to reporters gives an entertaining glimpse into White House press relations 50 years go. It is typed on a manual typewriter and tells reporters that it "MUST BE HELD IN STRICT CONFIDENCE and no portion, synopsis or intimation may be given out or published UNTIL RELEASE TIME.") Eisenhower estimated the interstate portion of his plan would cost $25 billion over 10 years ($198 billion in today's dollars). That's significantly lower than the number Mica cited, even in current dollars. But the ultimate cost is in line with what Mica said: The total cost is now roughly $445 billion in today's dollars, according to a 1996 report for the American Highway Users Alliance. Another estimate , on the Web site What it Costs.com, puts the number right at $500 billion. So Mica is right on the $30 billion for the current stimulus bill, but the $500 billion interstate cost he cites is the ultimate cost, not the original proposal from Eisenhower. His underlying point is still correct, however, that the highway portion of the stimulus bill is small compared with Ike's plan. So we find his statement Mostly True.

pomt-09826	"All the really great programs in American history, Social Security, was done without Republicans. Medicare was done without Republican support until the last vote where they realized they had to get on board."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/aug/28/howard-dean/dean-claims-social-security-and-medicare-were-pass/	With virtually no Republican support for the health care reform bill, some Democrats believe they will have to go it alone. But Howard Dean, the former chairman of the Democratic National Committee, isn't worried about the political repercussions. When asked about the risks of abandoning efforts for a bipartisan bill, Dean had this to say: "All the really great programs in American history, Social Security, was done without Republicans. Medicare was done without Republican support until the last vote where they realized they had to get on board," Dean said on the Aug. 25, 2009, episode of The Rachel Maddow Show . "So a lot of the things that have been done that have helped seniors in particular have been done without Republican support at all and there's not going to be any political penalty. The only political penalty will be suffered is if we don't pass a bill and the Republicans know that. And that's why they're not interested in helping pass the bill." Our recollection about the votes on Social Security and Medicare was a little rusty, and we wondered whether Dean was right that both bills passed with no Republican support. To find out, we had to turn back the clock to 1935 — the height of the Great Depression — when President Franklin D. Roosevelt signed the Social Security Act, an insurance program funded through taxpayer dollars meant to support retirees. The legislation was controversial for a number of reasons, including its perceived effects on the labor market and whether its benefits favored working white men. Nevertheless, on Aug. 8, 1935, the conference report — the final version of the bill that melds together changes made in the House and in the Senate — passed in the House 372-33, with 81 Republicans voting in support. The next day, the bill was passed in the Senate 77-6, with 16 Republicans supporting the legislation. So Social Security did pass with Republican support. Thirty years later, a significant number of Republicans voted in favor of the Medicare bill. The House adopted the conference report on July 27, 1965, 307-116, with 70 Republicans supporting it. And on July 28, the Senate adopted the final version of the bill by a vote of 70-24, with 13 Republicans in favor of the bill. President Lyndon B. Johnson signed the Medicare bill into law on July 30, 1965. But is Dean correct that the Republicans didn't support Medicare until the end? Donald Ritchie, the associate historian in the U.S. Senate, told us that the Republican support wasn't just a last-minute phenomenon. During the discussion of both bills, "There were always progressive Republicans and liberal Republicans, some of whom supported Roosevelt and Johnson," Ritchie said. Johnson had the political muscle to pass Medicare because the 1964 elections ushered in 42 new Democrats to the House of Representatives, giving the party a two-thirds majority overall and a larger majority on the Ways and Means Committee, where the legislation would originate. Up until then, many members of the committee, including its Democratic chairman, Wilbur D. Mills, opposed the idea of government-funded health care. In fact, Mills proved a tough sell in 1965 until some of his own pet proposals were added to the legislation. One of those — the addition of a voluntary, supplemental health care plan — had its roots in a Republican alternative bill. In the House, no Republicans voted for the bill until it reached the floor. It passed the Ways and Means Committee by a party-line vote of 17-8, although the panel's GOP members endorsed some of the bill's non-health care related provisions, according to the 1965 Congressional Quarterly Almanac . Likewise, all four Republicans on the House Rules Committee — the panel that sets the boundaries of debate on all bills that come to the House floor — voted against the bill. In the Senate, however, there was Republican support in the Finance Committee. When the panel cast its final vote, the bill passed 12-5, with four of the committee's eight Republicans supporting it. (President Barack Obama would probably love to get even that much GOP backing.) So we find Dean is glossing over the details and exaggerating the partisan split. Both Social Security and Medicare were indeed championed by Democrats, but passed with the help of Republican votes. And while some GOP members waited until the last minute to support Medicare, it was backed by half the Republicans on the Senate committee. So we find Dean's statement False.

Romney, the son of a corporate CEO, made his own fortune leading private equity firm Bain Capital. But as the product of a wealthy Michigan suburb, private prep school and ultimately Harvard, Romney still faces accusations of silver-spoon privilege. "I know the Democrats want to go after the fact that I've been successful," Romney said at a Republican presidential debate in Charleston, S.C. on Jan. 19, 2012, as he explained why he would wait to release his tax returns. "I'm not going to apologize for being successful." His father, George Romney, who led Detroit automaker American Motors Corp., was a three-time governor of Michigan and himself ran for president in the 1960s. "I could have stayed in Detroit like him and gotten pulled up in a car company," Romney said at the debate. "I went off on my own. I didn't inherit money from my parents. What I have, I earned. I worked hard, the American way." We were curious. Did Romney, the last of George and Lenore's four children, receive no inheritance on his path to wealth? Romney's words We asked Romney's campaign about his claim. "Mitt Romney's success is based on his 25-year career in business and the fact that he founded and led one of the most successful private equity companies in the world," spokesman Ryan Williams said. That wasn't as helpful as, say, a copy of his father's will. Nor was there any information about George Romney's financial legacy in the many obituaries for the Michigan luminary, who died in 1995 at age 88. But Mitt Romney has addressed the question himself, it turns out, in an interview with C-SPAN in 2006. Host Brian Lamb asked him why his father hadn't given him an inheritance. Romney answered, "Well, he didn’t have as much as I think some people anticipated. And I did get a check from my dad when he passed away. I shouldn’t say a check, but I did inherit some funds from my dad. But I turned and gave that away to charity. In this case I gave it to a school which Brigham Young University established in his honor. ... And that’s where his inheritance ended up." According to a short history of the George W. Romney Institute of Public Management at BYU, the family provided an endowment in 1998, within a few years of George Romney's death. So, in Romney's own words, he did "inherit some funds" from his dad. But he gave them away. Why? "I figured we had enough of our own," he said. He probably did. By 1995, Romney had already led Bain Capital for more than a decade, where shrewd investments made him millions. He stepped down in 1999. He now says he's worth somewhere between $190 million and $250 million. How Romney got rich "I went off on my own," Romney said at the debate. "... What I have I earned. I worked hard, the American way." So while he didn't ultimately benefit from an inheritance, we wondered: Had Romney's parents' wealth helped build his own fortune? There's no evidence we saw that Romney's parents helped buy him a business career. But there were certain advantages to Romney's comfortable upbringing. Romney started college at Stanford, where his "allowance" was big enough for frequent plane tickets to sneak home to Michigan see his girlfriend, Ann, according to a recently published book by two Boston Globe journalists, "The Real Romney." After a two-year missionary trip to France, where he lived sparely as he proselytized door-to-door, he finished his undergraduate studies at BYU, where he married Ann in 1969. He was 22, his wife 19. His parents' wedding gift? A car. Meanwhile, the students — who started a family a year later — lived in a modest, $62-a-month basement apartment, Ann later told the Boston Globe. But they didn't have to work. "We were happy, studying hard. Neither one of us had a job, because Mitt had enough of an investment from stock that we could sell off a little at a time," she said. When the couple moved to Boston so Romney could study business and law at Harvard, his parents helped them buy a house. It's not clear who paid for his education, but Romney wasn't exactly a struggling student: enough cash for plane tickets, a car as a wedding gift, stock that kept him from having to work, help buying a home. What about that hard work he mentioned? When he got back from his mission trip to France, he wanted to "accomplish things of significance," according to a quote from The Real Romney. "I said, 'Boy, I want to do something with my life if I can.' So when I came home, I was a much better student." At BYU, he graduated with highest honors and gave a speech at graduation. He got accepted to a recently created dual-degree program in law and business at Harvard. Of hundreds of Romney's law and business school classmates at Harvard, just 15 earned the dual degree — which packed courses required for the two degrees into less time than earning them separately. Romney didn't just earn the degree. He graduated with honors from the law school and in the top 5 percent of his class in the business school, according to The Real Romney. His mere presence among the elite MBA/JD earners got him heavily recruited by Boston Consulting Group. So while he passed the Michigan bar in case he needed to go back to his dad's state to work near the car industry, it wouldn't be necessary. "(Romney) was an outstanding recruit with exceptional grades, and he was the very charming, smooth, attractive son of a former presidential candidate. So everybody was bending over backward to get their hands on him," said Charles Faris, who was with Boston Consulting Group, according to the The Real Romney. When he started work with Boston Consulting Group, "he worked his butt off," Faris said. The young father worked nights, weekends and traveled often, including frequent trips to Europe, the book says. He got hired away by Bill Bain at consulting company Bain & Co., who ultimately tapped him to launch Bain Capital in 1984. There, he made the deals that dramatically increased his wealth. Our ruling Mitt Romney, making the case that he made his own wealth, said, "I didn't inherit money from my parents." Indeed, he was already a wealthy man by the time his father, George, died in 1995. He did receive an inheritance but says he gave it away. We don't have independent confirmation of that. But a family-funded endowment at BYU started in 1998 to support the George W. Romney Institute of Public Management, bolstering Romney's claim. Did Romney's career benefit from having well-to-do parents? It certainly eased his way, with their financial help allowing him to focus on his studies. But there's good evidence he also worked hard to make his own success, graduating with honors at BYU and Harvard, and building a reputation at Boston Consulting Group and Bain that ultimately catapulted him to wealth. Romney wasn't entirely clear about the inheritance he gave away when he said he "didn't inherit money" from his parents. But he's right that such a gift wasn't key to his success.

pomt-02109	David Beckham’s proposed soccer stadium at Miami’s Port "threatens the 207,000 jobs and $27 billion economic impact tied to the cargo and cruise industries."	false	/florida/statements/2014/may/14/miami-seaport-alliance/david-beckhams-proposed-soccer-stadium-port-threat/	In late 2013, soccer superstar David Beckham splashed onto the scene of Miami-Dade stadium politics when he announced his pitch for a $250 million stadium. While politicians were intrigued by the idea of Beckham bringing major soccer to Miami, one of the main sites under consideration quickly drew fire: PortMiami. Some county commissioners balked at the idea of transforming part of a major economic hub for the county into a soccer stadium. Opponents, led by Royal Caribbean Cruises, created the Miami Seaport Alliance and took out ads on television, radio and in newspapers arguing that a stadium threatens the port’s livelihood. A full-page ad in the Miami Herald in April stated, "A soccer stadium is being proposed at PortMiami. The Miami Seaport Alliance opposes any development that threatens the 207,000 jobs and $27 billion economic impact tied to the cargo and cruise industries. All jobs are important for the future of Miami, but we cannot risk full-time, well-paying PortMiami jobs like crane operators, truckers and cargo loaders, for a few, part-time concession jobs like peanut sellers and ticket takers." Beckham’s investors responded with their own full-page ad in the Herald, vowing that a soccer stadium would achieve the port’s goals of creating jobs and revenue. At PolitiFact Florida, we are quite familiar with half truths about stadiums. It is a challenge to fact-check a prediction, but we decided to explore the evidence about whether a soccer stadium at the port would threaten the existing 207,000 jobs and $27 billion economic impact. Is the Alliance bending the truth about Beckham? Royal Caribbean leads opposition Beckham wants to rent a county-owned 12-acre site near the port to build a 25,000 seat stadium with an open roof. Beckham has said he will privately finance the construction and apply for a state sales tax subsidy, hoping to open the stadium in 2018. Port officials had planned to build a new 7 million square foot commercial district on the site, because it’s too shallow to accommodate ships. Beckham’s group says the stadium would still leave room for about a 1 million square foot commercial development. The port site isn’t the only one under consideration, though it appears to be one of Beckham’s favorites. At Mayor Carlos Gimenez’ request, Beckham is also considering filling in a boat slip in downtown, though that site also has challenges. Many of jobs ‘tied’ to the port aren’t at the port The spin in the ad begins with the number of jobs cited. The number cited -- 207,000 jobs -- comes from a study done for the port to measure its current economic impact. Martin Associates, a Pennsylvania-based firm, interviewed 485 cruise-related businesses in the Miami-Dade County area in 2012 and released the report last year. The report adds up various types of jobs, including direct port workers and suppliers. The study also accounts for "induced jobs," which includes jobs generated by spending by port workers. The largest category of jobs, though, is what the study calls "user jobs," which are importers or exporters in Florida that ship or receive cargo through the port. For example, if an Orange grove in Orlando ships a portion of their oranges through Miami, then the study translates that portion of the grove’s business -- including orange pickers in Orlando -- into a number of user jobs connected to PortMiami. The study concluded that port activity "supported" 207,804 jobs in the state of Florida. The vast majority -- 80 percent -- were "user jobs." The user jobs wouldn’t disappear from Florida if PortMiami wasn’t available. "These importers/exporters would divert their cargo through other ports," the study states. Similarly, most of the $27 billion in economic activity includes a lot of business that takes place far away from the port site in Miami. So hypothetically speaking, if the soccer stadium were to create such a morass that cargo and cruise companies jumped ship and fled Miami, those jobs and economic impact dollars wouldn’t vanish into thin air -- much of it would just move to other ports in Florida. Will stadium threaten existing port jobs? We sent the port report to a few economists, and several raised concerns about the jobs number in the context of the ad opposing the soccer stadium. Temple University economics professor Michael Leeds said that the "user jobs" category is a red herring. "It essentially counts a lot of people and money that will never come anywhere near Miami," he said. Those user jobs and the user income number leads to an exaggeration of the total numbers, said Holy Cross economics professor Victor Matheson. "That being said, in this case it doesn't matter whether the report is correct or not," said Matheson, a critic of public financing of stadiums. "Whether the port generates 20,000 jobs or 200,000 jobs, the question is whether Beckham will interfere with those jobs, and I just don't see a significant disruption." Cruise officials said the stadium could hurt the port, though. John Fox, president of the Miami Seaport Alliance, who lobbies on behalf of Royal Caribbean, pointed to a Moody’s report which downgraded the port’s credit rating in May. But the report didn’t mention the soccer stadium as a factor. Fox said that the stadium could scare away carriers who now operate out of Miami, sending them to other ports. Any other port could "sell their port over the Port of Miami due to real perceptions that delays will be a common issue and that this community is not serious about being in the commercial port business of being a port," Fox said. Bruce Rubin, a spokesman for Beckham, says the port’s plan for 7 million square feet of commercial development "would create far more traffic conflicts with cargo and cruise operations than would our plan for a professional soccer stadium" and the smaller adjacent commercial development. Rubin said the stadium will host about 25 large events per year and "a number of other activities." The 17 home games largely would occur on Saturday evenings which doesn’t coincide with the typical times for the arrival and departure of cruise passengers or cargo operators. Stadium supporters haven’t yet finished their study about projected jobs, but Rubin estimated that it would include 2,000 to 3,000 construction jobs. Economic experts weigh in on impact of stadium at port We sent a summary of the soccer battle to professors who study the economics of stadiums. Rick Eckstein, a sociology Professor at Villanova University who has studied stadium financing and criticized deals, told PolitiFact Florida, "Both groups are wildly exaggerating the economic impact of their respective plans." "Sports stadiums have a lousy record of spurring economic impact. Soccer stadiums, with but 19 games a year drawing about 20,000 visitors each, might be the least able to spur development. Conversely, I don’t think a soccer stadium would hurt development in that area. It would simply have no effect," he said. Matheson, a major critic of subsidies for sports stadiums, said that the stadium will cause some traffic disruptions during matches, but they would likely be minor. "It is hard to see how 20 days of extra traffic, most which will be on weekends, will have any significant impact on the port, especially if some decent traffic management is utilized," he said. "I don't find the port's objections particularly convincing. Do be concerned about traffic. Do be concerned about hidden costs of a privately financed stadium. But don't reflexively torpedo any type (of economic development) just because one industry doesn't like it." Bruce Seaman, a Georgia State University economist, said that the arguments by cargo and cruise industries "are nearly absurd. Even given the self-serving perspective they clearly represent, it is hard to imagine even pure rent-seekers bothering to make such weak arguments opposing that project." One professor we interviewed -- University of South Florida economics professor Philip Porter, a major critic of financing of sports stadiums -- said the anti-stadium side has a point. "If the soccer stadium project means the 7 million square foot commercial development would be compromised, Miami loses," Porter said. "One thing we’ve come to realize is that sports -- with such infrequent activity -- cannot compete with commercial activity in creating jobs and generating income." Our ruling The ad said that David Beckham’s proposed soccer stadium at Miami’s port "threatens the 207,000 jobs and $27 billion economic impact tied to the cargo and cruise industries." The numbers come from a study which states that the jobs related to the port are all over Florida. The ad is somewhat careful in the wording about the jobs because it states the jobs are "tied" to cargo and cruise industries, but then it talks about jobs at PortMiami such as crane operators who could be replaced by stadium peanut sellers -- which could create the impression that these are all direct jobs at the port, and that’s not the case. A soccer stadium at the port would certainly lead to some changes at the port -- and cruise operators are concerned about how that could change their operations. But at this point, there isn’t evidence that a stadium would threaten the port jobs or economic activity. We rate this claim False.

pomt-03240	"Why didn't (uninsured Americans) buy insurance? Because of the expense."	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2013/aug/15/rand-paul/rand-paul-daily-show-says-cost-biggest-barrier-uni/	During a recent appearance on The Daily Show, guest host John Oliver and Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., engaged in a lively exchange on health insurance. One of the issues they discussed was the high cost of health insurance. Paul, an eye surgeon, is strongly opposed to President Barack Obama’s health care law. During the interview, Oliver pressed him on how to get more Americans signed up for insurance. Paul told Oliver that according to the most recent statistics, "85 percent of people had insurance, so 15 percent didn't. So what you need to do is look at who are the 15 percent, and why don't they have insurance? Of the 15 percent who didn't have insurance, half of them made more than $50,000 a year. Why didn't they buy insurance? Because of the expense. They were young healthy people." In this fact-check, we’ll check whether the cost of insurance is the biggest barrier to uninsured Americans. In a separate report, we’ll look at his claim that half of the uninsured made more than $50,000 a year. Survey data consistently shows that cost is the biggest barrier to uninsured Americans obtaining coverage. When the Kaiser Family Foundation’s June 2013 health tracking poll asked uninsured respondents for the main reason they didn’t have health insurance, a plurality of 40 percent cited cost. The second-biggest factor, at 26 percent, was related to employment, such as being unemployed or having a job that doesn’t offer health insurance. These two reasons aren’t mutually exclusive -- someone could have told the pollster that their lack of a job was the biggest reason but also find cost to be a barrier to obtaining insurance. The only answer in the poll that suggests the respondent doesn’t face a cost obstacle is "doesn’t need insurance," which was the answer of only 11 percent. In another survey, the 2011 National Health Interview Survey, conducted by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, researchers asked, "Which of these are reasons you stopped being covered or don’t have health insurance?’’ Respondents were allowed to choose more than one reason. In this survey, too, a plurality -- 42 percent -- cited cost. Three other reasons cited are compatible with cost being an obstacle -- a lost job or a change in employment (26 percent), an employer that didn’t offer insurance (11 percent) and ineligible due to age or leaving school (9 percent). Just 6 percent cited "other," which included "didn’t want or need coverage," among other answers. "The cost of insurance is a major reason why people are uninsured -- Sen. Paul is right about that," said Jonathan Oberlander, a health policy professor at the University of North Carolina School of Medicine. "People without access to employer-sponsored coverage have a hard time affording it on their own, and that accounts for most of the uninsured." Our ruling Paul asked, "Why didn't (uninsured Americans) buy insurance? Because of the expense." Survey data supports him. A plurality of respondents in major surveys of the uninsured specifically cite cost as a barrier, and relatively few indicate that going uninsured is a voluntary choice. We rate Paul’s claim True.

pomt-04800	Tim Kaine supported "higher energy costs for families."	mostly false	/virginia/statements/2012/aug/21/us-chamber-commerce/us-chamber-commerce-says-tim-kaine-supported-highe/	When it comes to economic policies, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce says Tim Kaine, the Democratic candidate for U.S. Senate, is on the wrong track. A television ad by the Chamber puts the viewer on the front of a train, roaring past billboards proclaiming Kaine’s shortcomings. Among its claims: that Kaine, as governor, supported "higher energy costs for families." As proof, the chamber sent us Kaine’s testimony before a U.S. Senate hearing on climate change and the Chesapeake Bay in 2007. Kaine warned that rising temperatures and sea levels would damage the bay and the Hampton Roads region, and he urged the Senate to take action. "I support legislation that includes a cap-and-trade program for emissions of all greenhouse gases, imposes economy-wide controls rather than singling out a particular sector, and accounts for state efforts to standardize methodologies to record and measure greenhouse gas emissions through the Climate Registry," he said. Soon after his testimony, Sen. Joseph Lieberman, at the time a Democrat from Connecticut, and Sen. John Warner, R-Va., introduced a bill to implement a cap-and-trade system. Previous cap-and-trade bills were introduced in 2003 and 2005. Kaine did not say that he specifically supported a particular bill. Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., who introduced the legislation in 2003, said when the 2007 bill was put in the hopper, "The enormous economic costs of damage caused by air pollution and greenhouse gas emissions to the environment and human health are not factored into the price of power produced by fossil-fueled technologies. Yet, it’s a cost that we all bear, too often in terms of ill-health and diminished quality of life." Under cap and trade, the government would limit the allowable emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gasses. Companies that emit carbon dioxide, such as electric utilities, would either have to reduce emissions by using cleaner technology, or obtain credits from the government - either given or sold through an auction - to exceed limits. The government could use the revenues in any number of ways, including paying for general expenses, developing new energy-efficiency programs and giving rebates to ratepayers. In the 2007 bill, the national cap on carbon dioxide declined gradually from 5,775 million metric tons in 2012 to 1,732 million metric tons in 2050. The cost to consumers was analyzed by several government and non-government entities. The Energy Information Administration concluded that the 2007 legislation would cause gas prices to go up by 22 to 49 cents a gallon in 2020. And that would increase to 41 to 101 cents per gallon higher in 2030. Meanwhile, depending on the development of technology to capture and store carbon emissions, the average annual cost of household energy bills would increase by between $30 to $325 in 2020, and between $76 to $723 in 2030. Although the EIA does not make estimates beyond 2030, it says the costs would continue to escalate. The Environmental Protection Agency ran its own numbers. It said mandates to manufacture cleaner fuels would cause gas prices to rise by 53 cents a gallon in 2030 and by $1.40 a gallon in 2050. The EPA also projected that electricity prices would increase 44 percent in 2030 and 26 percent in 2050. Kaine spokeswoman Brandi Hoffine said that equating support for cap-and-trade legislation with support for "higher energy prices for families" is "ludicrous." She said Kaine supports cap and trade as part of a "package of larger reforms" that would "reduce our dependence on carbon-heavy energy sources and encourage the development of alternative energy and conservation." She noted that some cap-and-trade proposals would have funneled proceeds from auctions back to consumers in rebates. Under a 2009 bill backed by President Barack Obama, the CBO said those in the lowest 20 percent of earners would save about $40 in 2020, a statistic Hoffine cited. But the CBO also said other households would pay more for electricity, averaging $175 more and up to about $340 more, because they would receive smaller rebates and use more electricity than low-income families. Hoffine also pointed to a study about the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative, a 10-state compact for a cap and trade system. The system was put into place in 2009 and was evaluated after three years. The Analysis Group found that consumers saved a net of $1.1 billion compared to what the grid systems would have been without the cap-and-trade system, primarily because the states put auction proceeds toward energy efficiency programs. But ratepayers actually spent about 0.7 percent more for electricity up front. "In general, it is true that controlling carbon emissions or other pollution from energy will raise the cost of energy relative to not controlling that pollution," Adele Morris, fellow and policy director in climate and energy economics at The Brookings Institution, said in an email. But "the cap and trade approach is a substitute for other, more costly, ways to regulate greenhouse gases. Right now, because cap-and-trade didn't pass, the EPA is pursuing regulation of those emissions under its existing Clean Air Act authority, which means command and control approaches to regulation." The Center for Climate and Energy Solutions, the successor to the Pew Center on Global Climate Change, has issued fact sheets on several proposals for cap-and-trade legislation and programs. "Others have claimed that the bill will have no cost impact, but this ignores the very real economic costs of shifting to a clean energy economy," the center said of the 2009 bill. The Lieberman-Warner bill in 2007 proposed to auction some of the credits to pay for renewable technologies, workforce training and low-income energy assistance, while giving the rest to states and other recipients. The legislation was replaced by a companion bill in 2008, which died in the Senate that year. Our ruling The U.S. Chamber of Commerce says in a TV ad that Kaine supported "higher energy costs for families." It’s clear, as the Chamber notes in small print, that Kaine backs the concept of cap-and-trade legislation, but there’s no record of his support for a specific bill or proposal. Analyses of two measures that have been before in Congress in recent years concluded that cap-and-trade carries a cost for most consumers. At least one cap-and-trade program in place has resulted in an average lower cost for consumers through energy efficiency and rebates. And cap-and-trade legislation is one of the least expensive options for controlling greenhouse gases, experts said. So the assertion that cap and trade leads to higher energy prices is reasonable but depends on the specifics of a plan. The chamber cannot point to an instance where Kaine directly supported a particular measure that would raise energy bills, which is necessary context. There is an element of truth and a great deal of hyperbole in the chamber’s claim that Kaine supported higher energy bills for families. We rate it Mostly False.

pomt-05206	The United States has experienced "40 straight months of unemployment at 8 percent or higher."	true	/tennessee/statements/2012/jun/11/diane-black/tennessee-congresswoman-diane-black-says-jobless-r/	When the government’s jobs report for May offered a bleak picture of the economy, with employers adding just 69,000 jobs in May, U.S. Rep. Diane Black, R-Gallatin, and other lawmakers expressed their frustrations, often in very partisan terms. The report said the unemployment rate edged up slightly to 8.2 percent, from 8.1 percent in April, and Black issued a press release that among other things said the prospects for unemployed or underemployed Americans finding full-time work are not very good "after 40 straight months of unemployment at 8 percent or higher." We know the unemployment has remained stubbornly high, but has it really been at 8 percent or higher for 40 straight months? For the purposes of this ruling, we're only going to look closely at the statistics Black cited and stay out of the political blame game. Suffice to say, it’s not hard to find Republicans blaming Democratic policies and Democrats blaming Republican obstruction for the inability to move the economy closer to full employment. We called Black’s office and asked them to back up the claim. Her spokeswoman, Allison Huff, pointed us to a chart compiled by the Bureau of Labor Statistics, which is the gold standard for unemployment statistics. According to the bureau, the last time unemployment was below 8 percent was in January 2009, when it was 7.8 percent -- it then spiked quickly to 8.3 percent in February of 2009 and to 9.4 percent by May before topping out at 10.0 percent in October of 2009. It dropped gradually from there, and the May report listing unemployment at 8.2 percent marked the 40th consecutive month it has been at 8 percent or higher. As dismal as that may be, it’s not the record. "The rate of unemployment in the United States has exceeded 8 percent since February 2009, making the past three years the longest stretch of high unemployment in this country since the Great Depression," the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office reported in a study in February 2012. In the Great Depression era, unemployment topped 15 percent annually for six straight years, from 1931 to 1936, and never fell below 8.7 percent over 12 years, according to estimates adopted by the Bureau of Labor Statistics. In four consecutive years, unemployment exceeded 20 percent a year. Our colleagues at PolitiFact National cited those figures when they rated as False a claim by Republican National Committee chairman Reince Priebus, who said, "We have unemployment that rivals the Great Depression." There is a qualifier, though. The Depression-era unemployment data counted those age 14 and up, not 16 and up (the standard that began in 1948). In addition, monthly unemployment statistics were not kept until 1948 as well. Thus, all statistics during the Great Depression were on an annual basis. Our ruling Rep. Black did not go as far as some other Republicans and claim that unemployment is as bad as during the Great Depression. She merely said it has been at 8 percent or higher for 40 straight months. Based upon the government’s own data, we rate her statement as True.	None	Diane Black	None	None	None	2012-06-11T06:00:00	2012-06-01	['United_States']
pomt-00314	Says "Claire McCaskill receives the second-most contributions from insurance companies in the entire Senate."	mostly true	/missouri/statements/2018/sep/21/josh-hawley/fact-checking-josh-hawley-video-highlights-insurer/	In Missouri’s high-profile U.S. Senate race, voters are seeing dueling ads from the two candidates. The first volley came when incumbent Democratic Sen. Claire McCaskill released an ad (embedded here) that challenged her Republican opponent, state attorney general Josh Hawley, over health care. In the ad, McCaskill discusses her own struggle with breast cancer and warns that a lawsuit Hawley has signed onto threatens provisions within the Affordable Care Act that enable people with pre-existing conditions to get health insurance. Then, on Sept. 19, Hawley’s campaign took a portion of that ad and threw it back on McCaskill. The Hawley camp released a 15-second video that begins with McCaskill talking to the camera, saying, "The insurance companies already have too many senators on their side." A narrator responds: "What a hypocrite. Claire McCaskill receives the second-most contributions from insurance companies in the entire Senate." We found the Hawley campaign has a point about McCaskill's support from insurers, but it requires some caveats so voters have the full picture. A look at the data The visual in the video showing McCaskill at No. 2 on the contribution list comes from this page in the OpenSecrets.org database, a widely cited money-in-politics resource published by the Center for Responsive Politics. It shows the top recipients of donations from the insurance sector among senators in the 2017-18 campaign cycle. By the time we looked at the OpenSecrets page, it had been updated with new data that pushed McCaskill down by one slot to third. We won’t quibble with a third-place ranking as opposed to a second-place ranking; the underlying claim is that McCaskill ranks high among all senators. Some caveats However, a closer look at the methodology that went into creating the list in question brings up a couple of important points to note. • The OpenSecrets data for donations doesn’t just include health insurers; it includes all insurers, including life, property and car insurance companies. The Hawley camp argues that the video uses McCaskill’s exact language — "the insurance companies" — and that she did not specify health insurance companies. However, we believe anyone who sees the first three-quarters of McCaskill’s ad would clearly believe she was referring to health insurers, because that’s what the entire ad is about. • Because the 2018 list represents a snapshot in time, it doesn’t support the notion that McCaskill leads "the entire Senate" in donations from the industry. Generally speaking, senators take in significantly more money from donors during the one-out-of-three election cycles in which they are up for reelection, as McCaskill is now. This essentially shrinks the pool of incumbents actively raising money for an election. Yes, there are 100 senators, but there are only 35 seats up for election this November, and 32 incumbents running. Why does that matter? Of the top 10 senators on the OpenSecrets list, all are up for re-election except one, Sen. Mike Crapo, R-Idaho. In addition, McCaskill’s contributions from insurance companies have varied depending on what time period you look at. If you look at the 2014 and 2016 campaign cycles, McCaskill didn't rank in the top 20 either time. Even in her prior reelection cycle, 2012, McCaskill ranked 19th among senators, and if you add in non-incumbents running for the Senate that cycle, she fell out of the top 20 entirely. Meanwhile, McCaskill’s haul so far cycle — $295,338 — is a fraction of what four Republicans received in the 2016 cycle (Sens. Marco Rubio of Florida, Ted Cruz of Texas, Rob Portman of Ohio, and Pat Toomey of Pennsylvania) and what Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., received from the industry in the 2014 cycle. • Much of the money used to determine the 2018 rankings doesn’t come from "insurance companies." Donors on the OpenSecrets list don’t only include political action committees but also individual donors who have listed an employer. So a donation from a low-level employee or their spouse would count in this tally as coming from "the industry." Are there more revealing figures? If you look at related campaign-finance data, both sides can claim some vindication. When we asked the Center for Responsive Politics if they could drill down further to look only at health insurers’ donations, they told us that from 2013 to 2018, McCaskill received a combined $413,528 from donors related to the "accident and health insurers" category as well a separate category, health maintenance organizations. By contrast, Hawley, who was not a federal candidate for much of that time span, received just $5,400. On the other hand, if you look at the percentage of donations McCaskill received from the "insurance category," it’s pretty modest. She has received $295,338 from all insurance sources in the 2018 campaign cycle, but she’s raised in excess of $20 million from all sources as of this writing. So insurance-related donations account for just 1.4 percent of her contributions, casting doubt on Hawley’s implication that she’s controlled by the industry. Our ruling Hawley said that "Claire McCaskill receives the second-most contributions from insurance companies in the entire Senate." This isn't a perfect reflection of her standing among senators in terms of health insurance contributions. This ranking is based all types of insurers, not just health insurers. But with current contributions, she ranks third among current senators for insurance-related donations during the 2018 campaign cycle. We rate the statement Mostly True.

pomt-11826	Says the Republican tax plan "helps families" like one in which a woman lost her job and then lost her life savings fighting her husband’s cancer.	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2017/nov/13/american-action-network/how-would-gop-tax-bills-affect-families-strapped-b/	A conservative group is spending $3 million on a television ad campaign in 35 congressional districts -- including districts in California, Florida, Illinois, New York, Pennsylvania, North Carolina and Wisconsin -- arguing that a family that was nearly ruined financially by the father’s bout of cancer would benefit from a Republican tax proposal. The series of ads -- run by the American Action Network, which describes itself as a center-right group advocating policies based on freedom and limited government -- features Kendra Sroka, a working mother living in Michigan with her husband and two children, according to the group. One version of the ad, targeted to constituents of Rep. Elise Stefanik, R-N.Y., and tweeted by the group, features this narration: "Shortly after my husband got cancer, I lost my job. We were lucky to make it through. But we spent our life savings just to get by. So we’re glad Congress has released a plan that helps families like ours by cutting middle-class taxes. An independent analysis shows a typical family saves $1,200, and the plan closes loopholes while keeping tax rates the same for the rich. That’s fair. So thank Elise Stefanik. She has a plan to cut taxes for middle-class families like mine." See Figure 2 on PolitiFact.com We wondered whether the ad was justified in saying that the Republican tax bill would help a family that suffered such a serious health scare. Tax experts we checked with were skeptical. That’s because whatever you may think the Republican tax bill may provide in tax cuts -- a question of some dispute -- it also includes a provision that would strike the medical expenses deduction, which is almost perfectly tailored for a situation like the Sroka family’s. (Asked for this article whether the family had used the medical expense deduction, Sroka referred us back to the American Action Network; the group declined to provide further information about the family's past tax decisions.) See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com In general, more Americans would benefit from the tax changes than not, as we’ve noted -- just not every American. According to the nonpartisan Joint Committee on Taxation, 61 percent would see a tax decrease of at least $100 in 2019, and another 31 percent would see a tax change of less than $100 in either direction. That leaves 8 percent of tax filers, or roughly 14 million Americans, seeing a tax increase of at least $100. By 2027, 46 percent would see a decrease and 34 percent would see a change of less than $100, while 20 percent, or close to 40 million Americans, would see a tax increase. So it’s conceivable, even likely, that a family of four like the Srokas could come out ahead if you set their medical situation aside. But their medical situation is a focal point of the ad, so we felt that aspect deserved a closer look. About 9 million households, or 6 percent of tax filers, take the medical expense deduction, Gordon Mermin, a senior researcher at the Urban Institute-Brookings Institution Tax Policy Center, told the Associated Press. The Treasury Department estimates that the tax break costs $7.9 billion a year overall, while the Joint Committee on Taxation estimates the figure to be $10 billion. To take advantage of the medical expense deduction, a taxpayer has to itemize rather than take the standard deduction, which for a married couple reduces taxable income by $12,700. Medical expenses can only be deducted once they exceed 10 percent of the household’s income. (The portion of medical expenses accounting for that first 10 percent of household income can’t be deducted; the amount above that first 10 percent can be.) Many taxpayers choose to take the standard deduction because they don’t have enough items they can deduct to reach the standard threshold. But one type of family that would have good reason to itemize is one that faces a lot of unreimbursed medical expenses, which is the situation the Sroka family was in, judging by Kendra’s comment that "we spent our life savings just to get by" after the cancer diagnosis. The ad doesn’t say how much the family spent battling cancer, but if the family earned $60,000 -- a mid-range income for a four-person household -- they could deduct every dollar over $6,000 in unreimbursed medical expenses they had that year. So, if the family had medical expenses of $18,700, they would benefit from itemizing. (That’s equal to the first $6,000 non-deductible expenses they’d need to qualify, plus the $12,700 they would have gotten automatically from the standard deduction.) They could also reach that threshold of $18,700 with a lower amount of medical expenses if they also had other deductions to rely on, such as the state and local tax deduction. And non-cancer-related medical expenses they would have counted as well. All told, it’s not inconceivable that the Srokas, facing a diagnosis as serious as cancer, could have been hit with expenses in that ballpark. According to the AARP, citing IRS figures, the average medical expenses claimed by taxpayers with incomes below $75,000 ranged from just below $10,000 to almost $15,000. The ad’s claim is "a very questionable statement," said Gary McGill, director of the Fisher School of Accounting at the University of Florida’s Warrington College of Business. "Medical expenses could have wiped out most of their income so that they would have owed no income tax, especially if she lost her job too. So the scenario in the ad is not plausible. It doesn’t pass the smell test." The American Action Network told PolitiFact that the point of the ad was not to focus on the medical expense aspect of the family’s situation, but rather on the broader point that having another $1,200 would "unambiguously help a family’s budget, and in particular, those facing adverse circumstances" of any kind. The group also touted the potential for the tax bill to expand the economy more generally. One important caveat: Two days after the American Action Network launched its ad campaign, the Senate released its version of the tax bill and -- unlike the House version -- it would preserve the medical expense deduction. Our ruling The American Action Network ad said the Republican tax plan "helps families" like one in which a woman lost her job and then lost her life savings fighting her husband’s cancer. There’s a good chance that, if you ignore their medical situation, a family of four like the Srokas would have come out ahead under the Republican tax bill. However, it’s conceivable that the expenses they incurred fighting the cancer diagnosis could have enabled them to reduce their taxes even more -- an option that the House bill would take away. That would not be a factor in the Senate version of the bill, however. On balance, we rate the statement Half True.

pomt-09171	Turkey is an Arab country.	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/jun/06/markos-moulitsas/daily-kos-founder-admits-slip-calling-turkey-arab-/	During the June 6, 2010, edition of ABC's This Week, Markos Moulitsas, who publishes the liberal blog Daily Kos, joined a roundtable discussion that touched on Israel's decision earlier this month to send commandos to board a flotilla carrying aid and activists in defiance of an Israeli blockade of Gaza. The commandos clashed with some of those on board, and the raid ended with nine people dead. Moulitsas said, "I mean, the fact is whether Israel had the right to do what it did or not, they handled it so poorly that they basically alienated much of the world. They alienated an important Arab ally in Turkey, and they put the United States in a really difficult position." Shortly after the show ended, Moulitsas sent this Twitter message: "I got one for PolitiFact -- I slipped and called Turkey an 'Arab' country. I knew it as I said it. I meant 'Muslim.'" His Twitter correction was right: Turkey is not an Arab country. "Arabs and Turks are distinct peoples, separated by language, ethnicity, and geography. Although Turkey is adjacent to the Middle East, it is not generally considered part of that region," said Amy Hawthorne, executive director of the Hollings Center for International Dialogue. The Hollings Center operates in both Washington, D.C., and Turkey, and Hawthorne is a trained specialist in Middle East and Arab affairs. In Turkey, the predominant language is Turkish, while in Arab countries, the main language is Arabic. The Arab League has 22 members, and Turkey is not among them. And between 70 percent and 75 percent of Turkey's population is ethnically Turkish, with 18 percent Kurdish and the remainder smaller minorities (including a modest number of Arabs). The one thing that Turkey has in common with the Arab world is religion: An estimated 99.8 percent of the Turkish population is Muslim. "I knew I was wrong as I was saying it," Moulitsas told PolitiFact in an e-mail. "But everything moves so fast that everything had moved on before I could say, 'Boy that was dumb -- I meant 'predominantly Muslim country.'" Moulitsas has graciously copped to his error (and even invited us to ding him), but the Truth-O-Meter doesn't cut any slack for confessions. So we rate his statement False.

pomt-08301	Members of Congress did not have three days to read the bill "when the stimulus was rushed into law."	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/oct/31/john-boehner/john-boehner-says-stimulus-bill-was-rushed-passage/	During his last Saturday radio address before the Nov. 2, 2010, elections, House Minority Leader John Boehner, R-Ohio -- the likely speaker of the House if the Republicans take over -- made a closing argument for his party that included a call for greater congressional transparency. "There’s a third thing we need to do to help our economy, and that’s change Congress itself," Boehner said. "The American people are in charge of this country, and they deserve a Congress that acts like it. Americans should have three days to read all bills before Congress votes on them – something they didn’t get when the ‘stimulus’ was rushed into law. We should put an end to so-called ‘comprehensive’ bills that make it easy to hide wasteful spending projects and job-killing policies. Bills should be written by legislators in committee in plain public view – not written in the Speaker’s office, behind closed doors." We wanted to see whether Boehner was right that lawmakers or the public didn't get three days to pore over the stimulus prior to passage. The bill in question is the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, or H.R. 1. We should first point out that the bill went through more than one iteration, and Boehner didn't specify which one he meant. The bill was first passed by the House, then passed by the Senate with amendments, then went to a joint House-Senate conference committee to iron out differences. Then the final bill was passed in turn by the House and the Senate before going to President Barack Obama for his signature. According to THOMAS, the official legislative-tracking website of the Library of Congress, the bill was officially introduced in the House on Jan. 26, 2009 -- just six days after Obama was sworn in. By 6:11 pm on Jan. 28, after various procedural hurdles were cleared, the House approved this initial version. While THOMAS doesn't specify the exact hour the bill was introduced, the records indicate the vote took place less than three days after the bill was introduced. At this point, the bill went to the Senate. It was officially transmitted to the Senate on Jan. 29, and on Feb. 2, the Senate officially took up its own version along with a slew of amendments, and they were under consideration from Feb. 2 until Feb. 7. However, as this was going on, a bipartisan group of moderate senators, led by Sen. Olympia Snowe, R-Maine, and Sen. Ben Nelson, D-Neb., was trying to craft a scaled-down version of the bill that could win the support of the required 60 Senators. They succeeded, and on Feb. 7, the new Senate version was introduced. After moving through a series of steps, the Senate passed the measure at 12:27 p.m. on Feb. 10. So for the Senate version, the chamber and the public did have roughly three days to consider the bill, which was very similar to the initial version. Because the versions passed in each chamber were different, leaders in the two chambers quickly established a conference committee -- a panel of House and Senate members charged with hammering out a compromise. This conference committee officially filed its new bill at 10:25 p.m. on Feb. 12. It was less than 24 hours before the House acted on the conference report, passing it at 2:24 p.m. on Feb. 13. The Senate quickly followed suit, passing the measure at 5:29 p.m. the same day. Four days later, on Feb. 17, the president signed it. To summarize: The first version clearly passed the House less than three days after it was introduced, while the centrist compromise version passed the Senate roughly three days after it was formally introduced. Meanwhile, both chambers passed the conference report -- the final version that became law -- within 24 hours of the bill's filing. So in all except cases except the main Senate vote, it's clear Boehner is correct. And in the case of the Senate version, he's cutting it close because it was right at three days. All in all, that's strong support for his claim, so we rate it True.	None	John Boehner	None	None	None	2010-10-31T17:10:27	2010-10-30	['United_States_Congress']
pomt-14035	"Hypocrisy at the Clinton Foundation: Top male staff made on average $218,029 while top female staff made $153,014 from 2010-2014."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/may/27/donald-trump/donald-trump-says-clinton-foundation-pays-top-wome/	Donald Trump is calling Hillary Clinton a hypocrite when it come to gender pay equality, charging that her husband’s Clinton Foundation doesn’t walk the walk when it comes to paying women and men equally. Trump recently shared a post on his Instagram account that sought to highlight pay disparities at the Clinton Foundation. The foundation was founded by her husband, former President Bill Clinton. Hillary Clinton has worked for the foundation in periods when she wasn’t serving in government or running for president. "Hypocrisy at the Clinton Foundation: Top male staff made on average $218,029 while top female staff made $153,014 from 2010-2014," Trump posted on May 24, 2016, to his 1.6 million followers. Clinton has been the target of these types of charges before in her time as a U.S. senator. Sean Hannity’s claim that Clinton "actually paid female staffers a lot less than men" rated Mostly False. We wondered if this attack was more accurate. A general warning about these types of claims Democrats and Republicans often spin the facts about the gender pay gap, and small changes in how you phrase a claim can make a big difference. For years, we have fact-checked claims by Democratic politicians decrying the gender wage gap, which has been in the neighborhood of 77 cents on the dollar, with slight ups and downs over the years. When politicians simply state the existence of this wage gap, we generally rate those claims Mostly True. What keeps it from a full True is that this gap does not stem entirely from discrimination. The statistic in question doesn’t say that women earn 77 cents for every dollar a man does in the same job. Indeed, that’s a claim we have consistently rated as Mostly False. Rather, the 77 cent figure refers to the overall difference between what men make and what women make. That difference can be shaped not just by discrimination but also by voluntary choices, such as the specific careers men and women pursue and whether they decide to take time off to raise children. Once you genuinely compare men and women in an apples-to-apples comparison -- that is, in an equivalent job, with similar experience, tenure and achievements -- the wage gap doesn’t disappear, but it does shrink significantly. Academics differ on exactly how much, but the 77 cent figure is a much more powerful data point, so it’s the one Democrats and their allies have traditionally turned to. We suggest you read our PolitiFact Sheet to learn more. The number behind Trump’s claim Trump’s claim includes spin we’ve seen before. He’s looking at only a small number of foundation employees while ignoring the central point of the equal pay argument -- which is whether the employees are doing the same work and being compensated differently because of their gender. Though the Trump campaign did not respond to an inquiry, we’re fairly certain his data comes from the Clinton Foundation’s IRS form 990 -- the tax form that nonprofit groups are required to file annually. The forms -- which are available for public inspection on the foundation’s website -- require the organization to list the compensation for its highest-paid officials. For the Clinton Foundation, that has typically been in the range of eight to 12 officials per year. We couldn’t reverse-engineer the specific figures cited in Trump’s post -- there are various ways to calculate the compensation figures listed -- but the numbers we did come up are in line with the ones Trump cited. Trump’s calculation has female top officials at the foundation earning, on average, 70 cents for every dollar that the average male top official at the foundation earned. If you look at the total compensation reported, which includes fringe benefits, our calculations showed that women earned 67 cents for every dollar earned by a man. If you look instead at the salary column only, the figure was 66 cents on the dollar. If you remove the compensation for the officials identified as CEOs during that period, the ratio improves, but still climbs only to 77 cents. And if you use the median amount rather than the average -- which statisticians usually prefer because it gives less emphasis to extreme data points -- the figure still improves to only 76 cents on the dollar. Any way you look a it, among those eight to 12 high-ranking foundation employees, the men consistently earned more than women. (For what it’s worth, an analysis of the Trump campaign’s financial-disclosure forms reported in the Huffington Post and Slate.com found the same trend applied to Trump.) Why these figures don’t prove gender discrimination The salaries of eight to 12 executives do not prove the Clinton Foundation and Hillary Clinton are hypocrites when it comes to equal pay. The number of salaries included in Trump’s comparison accounts for just a fraction of all employees in the organization -- and even of senior management at the foundation. The foundation told PolitiFact that there are "several hundred" employees in the United States alone. Experts say this is too small a sample to say much about the foundation’s overall compensation practices. "I’m not sure I would draw too much from such a small number of employees," said Linda Babcock, an economist at Carnegie Mellon University's H. John Heinz III School of Public Policy and Management. In addition, the types of jobs disclosed in the tax form run the gamut from CEO to information technology director to senior fellow to human resources director. Few organizations would pay the CEO the same as an IT director, so finding differences doesn’t necessarily mean much without a much deeper analysis of the employer’s hiring practices. "The Clinton Foundation could argue it has paid equitable wages to both men and women, notwithstanding the fact that its high-paid men earned higher salaries than its high-paid women," said Gary Burtless, an economist with the Brookings Institution. In fact, experts say that evidence of gender pay discrimination is most discernible at the lower end of the pay scale. Top-level positions are usually filled by people who have specific credentials and career experiences. Because these factors are in high demand in the broader employment marketplace and often hard to find in a single candidate, the compensation level tends to be tailored to the specific candidate, whether a man or a woman. "Compensation is influenced by one's alternative pay options," said Hannah Riley Bowles, a senior lecturer in public policy at Harvard’s Kennedy School of Government. "Dramatic differences could be explained by one's market value in the private sector, which is likely to vary substantially looking at senior professionals with public-interest careers." In a statement, the foundation told PolitiFact that at the end of 2014, the senior leadership listed publicly on their website included nine women and nine men, and those women earned 91 cents for every dollar a man earned. The foundation also said that at the end of 2014, 64 percent of its U.S.-based employees were women. "Pay equity is an important and difficult issue that many large organizations grapple with, and we take it seriously at the Foundation," the foundation said. Our ruling Trump’s post said, "Hypocrisy at the Clinton Foundation: Top male staff made on average $218,029 while top female staff made $153,014 from 2010-2014." If you allow some leeway on what accounts for top staff, Trump is close on the numbers. But the statistical pool is too limited and the methodology is too crude to demonstrate evidence of hypocrisy. Trump is guilty of ignoring the nuances of gender-based wage disparities, just as Democrats often over-simplify the meaning of the 77-cent figure. The statement is partially accurate but takes things out of context, so we rate it Half True. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/ba673130-73fe-4886-9d2d-d3a5f79b4428	None	Donald Trump	None	None	None	2016-05-27T16:38:03	2016-05-24	['Clinton_Foundation']
pomt-04388	"Regulations have quadrupled. The rate of regulations quadrupled under this president."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/oct/18/mitt-romney/federal-regulations-quadrupled-under-obama/	During the town hall presidential debate, Mitt Romney accused Barack Obama of strangling small businesses with too much regulation. That's been a popular theme with Republicans and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, who have complained about a "tsunami" of new regulations under Obama since 2010. Asked by one of the town hall participants about outsourcing, Romney gave his prescription for keeping jobs in the United States. First he spoke about the corporate tax rate, which he believes is too high and prevents job creation. Then he turned to regulations. "Regulations have quadrupled," Romney said. "The rate of regulations quadrupled under this president." We decided to check Romney’s numbers and see if he was right. Romney’s quadruple regulation claim The Romney campaign told us the basis for the statement was research by the Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank. An ongoing study by Heritage documents regulation activity by the federal government. Its latest update said President George W. Bush’s administration adopted 28 "major regulations" that increased burdens on the private sector in its first three years, compared with 106 by the Obama administration. But viewers of the debate didn’t hear the caveats that should have been attached to Romney’s statement. First, he was referring only to "economically significant" regulations, which are those with a cost estimate of $100 million or higher. Second, the Heritage report doesn’t account for all regulations. It only looks at regulations that Heritage researchers said would "limit activity or mandate activity by the private sector." James Gattuso, an author of the Heritage report, said Romney’s use of the phrase "rate of regulations" seemed to be an effort to distinguish between all regulations and new regulations approved under a president. "Rate" implies a time frame. Heritage made comparisons about regulations over a three-year period. But we find Romney was not clear about which time frame he was using during the debate. Other data contradict Romney Since Heritage looked narrowly at high-cost regulations that it judged to be harmful to businesses, we sought other research about regulations and found little to support Romney's claim. The annual number of regulations approved under the Obama administration is about the same as other administrations in the past 18 years, according to OMB Watch, a left-leaning group that advocates for transparency in the Office of Management and Budget, better known as the OMB. In a September report titled "The regulatory tsunami that wasn’t," the group used records from the OMB to evaluate charges that the Obama administration was imposing more regulations than other recent presidents. In fact, the most up-to-date figures show about 8.5 percent fewer regulations in Obama’s first 46 months than in the same time frame for Bush. That tally comes from the Office of Management and Budget. The chart below comes from the OMB Watch report, comparing regulations and economically significant regulations under presidents Bill Clinton, Bush and Obama. "The story is much more of continuity than radical change," said Michael Livermore, executive director of the Institute for Policy Integrity at the New York University School of Law. Since 1994 the number of regulations approved per year has ranged from 228 to 371, the group found. Between 2009 and 2011, the Obama administration approved an average of 297 regulations per year, comparable to yearly figures for the past 18 years. (In 1992 and 1993, the numbers were much higher, exceeding 1,000 regulations both years.) Even among the economically significant regulations, Obama is nowhere near quadrupling them: For the first three years of the Obama and Bush administrations, Obama is about 24 percent higher. (The numbers on the OMB Watch chart differ from Heritage because the conservative group only looked at economically significant regulations that it deemed to be harmful to the private sector, a subset of the total number. Also, Heritage relied on records from the Government Accountability Office, which includes regulations from independent agencies in addition to those in the executive branch.) Although Republicans have criticized Obama for over regulation of business, his former "regulatory czar" Cass Sunstein received widespread criticism for not enforcing several high-profile rules, such as a tighter ozone pollution standard and rules on coal ash disposal. In a May editorial, The New York Times called the attacks about too much regulation "absurd" because "the administration has a mediocre record when it comes to curbing dangerous practices by industry." Our ruling Romney said that regulations and the rate of regulations quadrupled under Obama. He was basing that on the Heritage study, but he did not include important caveats about how the study was conducted. And more importantly, the actual data on regulations show Obama's rate of regulations is no different from the past 18 years. This is a broad claim describing its own evidence inaccurately. False.

pomt-15101	Says history suggests sports will "quickly subsume a lot of the attention span of the country" in the presidential primary.	half-true	/punditfact/statements/2015/sep/16/hugh-hewitt/hugh-hewitt-says-fall-sports-sap-public-interest-/	Fox News crushed past audience numbers with the first Republican presidential debate. Now CNN has its shot to match or beat the 24 million viewers that tuned in for round one. Conservative radio host Hugh Hewitt will be part of the CNN panel firing questions at the candidates, and Hewitt argues that they’d better do well now before the American public begins tuning out. "Someone needs to break out of the pack if they're going to catch up to Donald Trump," Hewitt said on CNN’s State of the Union on Sept. 13, 2015. "So, they got to throw some long balls. The NFL starts this weekend. It's going to quickly subsume a lot of the attention span of the country. So, this is really the last opportunity for the 10 not named Donald to try and make themselves the alternative to Donald Trump." In an op-ed titled "Why Wednesday’s GOP presidential debates will matter," Hewitt made a similar point. "The arrival of tailgating and of fall temps will also drop the temps of the campaign rhetoric," he wrote. "Competition sets in for the Trump Show, and it won’t come from Jeb Bush, Ted Cruz, Marco Rubio and Scott Walker. It will come from SportsCenter." We wondered if fall sports really does drive down interest in politics. We ran the question by Hewitt, live on his radio show, and he said it stands to reason that interest in politics will suffer because people have a finite amount of time to consume media. "If we look at the fact that the NFL is by far the most popular sport, the ratings for the World Series, especially when they feature the Cleveland Indians are very very high, therefore it must stand to reason that there is less time for politics because we spend so much time on sports," Hewitt said. "My proposition, and it’s merely my argument, is it has to be true that Americans have less time to spend on politics between now and Christmas then they have had up until this point." In terms of hard information, however, the polling data undermines Hewitt’s assertion. Going back to 2007, the Pew Research Center has been asking people if they follow various news stories "very closely, fairly closely, not too closely, or not at all closely." One of the stories the interviewers list is the election. They would do this nearly every week, with a hefty sample of over 1,000 people. Here are the trends in 2007 and 2011 (at this point in the election cycle four and eight years ago) for people who said they followed election news very or fairly closely: Source: Pew Research Center via Roper Center for Public Opinion Research There are some ups and downs by a handful of percentage points, but overall, about 45 to 55 percent of the public (depending on the year) said they were following the election, with perhaps a slight increase through the season. The surveys took place in slightly different weeks but both years saw dips during October. The one in 2011 happened to coincide with the World Series (the St. Louis Cardinals won in the seventh game). In 2007, it was around the period of the American League Championship Series. Whatever might explain the sudden drops, interest recovered immediately. Hewitt discounted the Pew data because it gets at his point indirectly. "Unless they ask the specific question, ‘Does your political consumption go down as your football consumption goes up’, you are guessing," he said. We couldn’t find a political scientist who specifically studied whether football and baseball reduce Americans’ appetite for politics. One analyst of public polling, Thomas Holbrook at the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee, said he has no hard data, but he’s skeptical of the premise. "I do doubt, however, that football is going to knock the presidential contest off the front page, to use an archaic reference," Holbrook said. "If nothing else, we have had baseball and summer vacation during the most recent period, neither of which seemed to diminish the importance of the campaign." John Sides, a political scientist at George Washington University, said there’s some evidence that public engagement remains robust through the fall. "There is precedent for lots of poll movement after this point," Sides said. "There was certainly some in 2011, including surges for (Herman) Cain and (Newt) Gingrich." Sports and election viewing is not a zero sum game In our interview, Hewitt assumed that there is a finite time for consuming media and that football must compete with politics. Put simply, if you’re watching sports, that’s less time for you to pay attention to the election. But, of course, it is possible to give up time spent on another activity, such as washing the car, to watch football. Also, the importance Hewitt places on football and baseball viewership assumes that those people would otherwise have been paying attention to the primaries. But it’s likely at least some of those diehard sports fans didn’t follow election coverage in the first place. (Remember, only about 50 percent of respondents say they are closely following the election news.) Our ruling Hewitt said fall sports pull voters away from paying attention to the presidential primaries. The polling data from 2007 and 2011 shows that voter interest in election news held steady at about the 50 percent mark. There were brief dips in October that coincided with the American League Championship one year and the World Series the next, but both were only momentary interruptions. The data don’t measure the precise trade-off between politics and sports, but the stability of the audience for election news shows no impact of any external factor, whether it’s sports, weather or anything else.

pomt-02127	Wendy Davis raised money for a U.S. House Democrat who is a member of a Democratic socialists group.	pants on fire!	/texas/statements/2014/may/09/greg-abbott/abbott-claim-wendy-davis-raised-money-member-socia/	Republican Greg Abbott says Wendy Davis raised money far from Texas for a U.S. House Democrat who doubles as a member of a socialist group. In a press release headlined "Sen. Davis Has A Lot To Answer For," Abbott said Davis, the Democratic gubernatorial nominee, campaigned with U.S. Rep. Jan Schakowsky of Chicago, a liberal initially elected to Congress in 1998. Abbott’s campaign manager, Wayne Hamilton, said in the release: "Sen. Davis’ fundraising on behalf of an extreme liberal Chicago congresswoman – a member of the Democratic Socialists For America no less – is merely the latest in a series of questions Sen. Davis has refused to answer about her ethics and her judgment." It’s not unheard of for someone to assert a foe is a socialist. But such claims haven’t held up in our past fact checks and Abbott’s statement ultimately lacked confirmation as well. In 2011, we rated as Pants on Fire a claim that U.S. Reps. Sheila Jackson Lee of Houston and Eddie Berniece Johnson of Dallas were among Socialists in Congress. At the time, a leader of the Democratic Socialists of America said no members of Congress were members of its party. The next year, PolitiFact in Washington, D.C., gave the same rating to a claim by Gov. Rick Perry that President Barack Obama was a socialist. Abbott’s May 6, 2014, release pointed out that a May 5, 2014, Chicago Sun-Times news blog post said Davis, who had raised money for her own campaign in Chicago May 4, was going to be among featured guests for Schakowsky’s annual "Ultimate Women's Power Lunch" at midday along with Lizz Winstead, co-creator of the Daily Show, and Illinois Gov. Pat Quinn, Sweet wrote. Abbott’s offered basis for the socialist claim was an Oct. 16, 2010, National Review blog post on "The Corner," a National Review Online blog that describes itself as a "web-leading source of real-time conservative opinion." The 2010 post, by Stanley Kurtz, a senior fellow at the Washington, D.C.-based Ethics & Public Policy Center, said Kurtz had earlier come across "documentary evidence" that Schakowsky was a member of the the Democratic Socialists of America (not the Democratic Socialists For America) at the start of her political career. Kurtz’s post closed by saying the "idea of socialist politicians working openly or quietly within the Democratic Party is not a wild impossibility but a real phenomenon." No documents were included in the blog post to back up his claim that Schakowsky had been a member of the socialist group. So we followed up with Kurtz, who said by email that Schakowsky was an "active member" of Chicago’s DSA chapter in the 1980s, a conclusion he said he based on chapter newsletters from 1983 and 1986 that he said he viewed in archives at New York University. "I do not know how long" Schakowsky "remained a member of the DSA," Kurtz wrote. After we published this fact check, Kurtz told us by email that he sent Breitbart Texas copies of the relevant newsletter pages. The February/March 1983 issue of the Chicago Socialist, published by the Chicago chapter, credits Schakowsky as the author of an article recapping a meeting of the Illinois Public Action Council, a mix of progressive groups. A June 1986 newsletter item, headlined "DSAers on the move," states that on the local political scene, Schakowsky’s bid "for Cook County Board got a boost when she drew 2nd ballot position among 14 candidates." The Cook County Board of Commissioners is the county’s legislative body. By email, Bob Roman, secretary of the Chicago DSA chapter, told us the posted newsletter excerpts were authentic. Schakowsky’s House spokesman, Lee Whack, referred us to her campaign political director, Alex Armour, who didn’t engage. By telephone, Maria Svart, the national director of the DSA, noted the group is an activist and educational group and not a political party. She also reaffirmed what a predecessor in that role, Frank Llewellyn, told us in 2011. To join the group, a person must fill out a form and pay dues, Llewellyn said, adding that the last member of Congress who was a card-carrying member was California Democratic Rep. Ron Dellums, who served 28 years in the House until leaving in 1998. Svart also said that while the group doesn’t announce its members, as far as she knows, Schakowsky isn’t a member and never was. Separately, we spotted a web post by the Chicago chapter of the DSA showing Schakowsky spoke at the group’s May 13, 2011, Eugene V. Debs-Norman Thomas-Michael Harrington dinner celebrating union organizers and other activists on the left. A May-June 2011 DSA recap said Schakowsky told guests that despite Democrats being the House minority, she was optimistic in that conservatives in Congress had over-reached. A DSA web page on the history of the annual dinner lists Schakowsky as the 2000 dinner’s honoree. That listing led to another web post detailing why Schakowsky was honored, touching on her actions as a consumer advocate and state and federal legislator. It didn’t speak to her membership (or not) in the DSA. By phone, Roman said Schakowsky is "not somebody that we claim as a member." He also said he generally doesn’t comment on whether anyone is current or former member. "Once you say ‘so and so’ is a member, was a member or was never a member, then you open yourself to queries about any single person who has ever been a member," Roman said. To our inquiry, Davis campaign spokesman Zac Petkanas emailed us a copy of the invitation to the Schakowsky event attended by Davis. The invitation lacks mention of Davis--and lists Winstead as the star attraction. Petkanas also provided what he described as the prepared text of Davis’ remarks at the event, which do not include an appeal for donations to Schakowsky’s political kitty. "Davis stopped by the event to talk about Texas and give an update on her campaign," Petkanas said. Our ruling Abbott said Davis raised money for a member of a socialist group. Davis appeared at a Chicago fund-raiser for Schakowsky, who may have once participated in the Chicago chapter of the DSA and has been saluted by it. Abbott didn’t provide, nor did we find, evidence of Schakowsky being a current member of the group. We light a match when a statement lacks factual backup and seems ridiculous. Pants on Fire! PANTS ON FIRE – The statement is not accurate and makes a ridiculous claim. Click here for more on the six PolitiFact ratings and how we select facts to check. UPDATE, 6:18 p.m., May 12, 2014: This article was updated to include detail about the newsletter excerpts relied upon by an author to conclude Schakowsky was a DSA member in the 1980s. This addition did not change our rating of Abbott’s reference to Schakowsky as a current DSA member.

pomt-03788	"Very few men outlive their own fertility."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2013/mar/28/charles-cooper/attorney-same-sex-marriage-case-says-very-few-men-/	Kids are at the center of marriage, argue supporters of California’s same-sex marriage ban. But infertile opposite-sex couples can get married, opponents point out — so why not same-sex pairs? Men stay fertile till their deathbeds, said an attorney arguing against rights for same-sex couples. Confused? Consider the actual debate before the Supreme Court on March 26, 2013, in Hollingsworth vs. Perry. Justice Elena Kagan compared a ban on marriage licenses for couples over age 55 with a ban on marriage licenses for same-sex couples. Couples over 55 are unlikely to produce children, she pointed out. Yet it would be unconstitutional to deny them a marriage license. So, she asked, what’s the difference between that couple and a same-sex couple that can’t naturally conceive? Attorney Charles Cooper, arguing in favor of California’s ban, said, "With respect to couples over the age of 55, it is very rare that … both parties to the couple are infertile." A bit later, he clarified: "Very few men outlive their own fertility." He explained that the state’s interest in marriage extends to older couples, because preserving the "marital norm" — with its obligations of fidelity and monogamy — discourages "irresponsible procreative conduct outside of that marriage." (He meant old guys having affairs with young mistresses.) It’s settled science that most women over 55 can’t naturally conceive. But we wondered — apart from what it may mean for the constitutionality of same-sex marriage — what does science say about men’s fertility in their declining years? Do "very few men outlive their own fertility"? What studies say — and don’t say We spoke with a range of fertility experts, combed through their research, and can tell you this: Science doesn't yet tell us how many old men can make babies. Especially if we’re talking about natural conception of the variety that might take place if a 70-year-old is seeing a 25-year-old on the side. The kind that requires, you know, sex, and enough sperm that move vigorously enough to reach and penetrate an egg. (One expert told us some couples who visit fertility clinics don’t realize sex is required to make babies. We’re going to assume here that you generally get how this process works.) We do know that roughly 10 to 20 percent of couples generally are infertile, with the man’s fertility a factor in about 40 percent of those cases. But evidence is tricky when it comes to fertility as men age. Cooper’s office sent us links to two studies that note men make sperm late into life. But one happens to document age-related decline in sperm quality and the other notes that studies suggest men contribute to reduced fertility beginning in their early 40s. Here’s a roundup of points on both sides. Signs of late-life fertility: • There’s no "cliff" as with menopause around age 50 in women, where fertility drops off dramatically. • Most men still make sperm into old age, studies say. (This is different from women, who are born with all the eggs they will ever have — no making fresh ones.) • Sperm count, one of the most important measures of male fertility, isn’t as sensitive to age as other factors, said Andrew La Barbera, scientific director for the American Society for Reproductive Medicine. • We’ve all heard of guys old enough to be great-grandfathers fathering kids. Or, as Justice Antonin Scalia joked in court, about the late Sen. Strom Thurmond of South Carolina, who fathered four children in his late 60s and early 70s. Points that give pause: • While there’s no menopause-like fertility cliff for men, sperm quality, amount of semen and fertility do appear to decline with age. Older men may be more likely to make sperm that’s strangely shaped and doesn’t swim well. "These data suggest that men may become progressively less fertile as they age," said a 2003 study cited by Cooper’s office. • The timing of fertility decline may vary dramatically from person to person — but there’s a need for more research to explain the variation. • There’s no clear research that shows how many older men may be capable of impregnating a woman in a year of regular sex, the clinical definition of fertility. "We don’t have data on men as they age ... not men who are in their 60s and 70s," said Harry Fisch, clinical professor of urology and reproductive medicine at Weill Cornell Medical College and author of The Male Biological Clock. "Very few men in these studies are older." "If it’s true, then let me ask you: Where’s the data?" That point was echoed by researchers who explained the limits of current studies. "It is rather difficult to give a precise estimate of (men’s) fertility by age because very few are still trying to have children beyond 60 or 65 years," said Henri Leridon, an expert in human reproduction who headed research at France’s National Institute for Demographic Studies. An Israeli fertility researcher, Eliezer Girsh, told PolitiFact that not only does fertility decline in men after age 50, but that just 20 to 40 percent of men are "still fertile in advanced age." Other experts said that, frankly, there’s a need for more research. But anecdotes sometimes overshadow the lack of data. The oldest scientifically documented case of fatherhood: a 94-year-old. Our ruling Cooper argued before the Supreme Court that "very few men outlive their own fertility." Experts we consulted generally agree that men — or at least some men — may still father children well into their advanced years. But whether that’s most men or a minority isn’t yet supported by research. Meanwhile, emerging studies document declining fertility as individual men age, and studies don’t yet confirm how many men remain fertile their entire lives. Given the sweeping nature of Cooper's claim, and the lack of unequivocal evidence, we rate it Half True.	None	Charles Cooper	None	None	None	2013-03-28T17:24:16	2013-03-26	['None']
pomt-08169	On banning earmarks.	full flop	/florida/statements/2010/dec/01/bill-nelson/bill-nelson-talks-one-way-earmarks-votes-another/	Florida's U.S. Sen. Bill Nelson joined 32 Republicans and six other Democrats on Nov. 30, 2010, in unsuccessfully pushing for a moratorium on earmarks for the next three federal budget years. But that's not the position Nelson staked out just two weeks prior. Speaking to reporters on Nov. 15, 2010, after meeting with Florida U.S. Sen.-elect Marco Rubio, Nelson said earmarks were an important part of creating jobs and growing Florida's economy. (Rubio supports a moratorium on federal earmarks). Nelson said he gave Rubio "the example of bringing a nuclear aircraft carrier to Mayport (and) the necessary earmarks that take place over five years. It's a request by the Department of Defense, but if I didn't attend to that appropriation, the Virginia delegation was going to eliminate a carrier going into Florida." Nelson then talked about ports in Miami and Jacksonville needing millions of dollars to deepen their channels so that ships using the Panama Canal could dock there -- and how getting an earmark to pay for the work is critical. "That is huge to Florida -- to trade, to jobs, to economic activity, that all of those big cargo ships coming through the Panama Canal come to Florida instead of going to Savannah and to Charleston," Nelson said. "Those are the hard realities when we talk about the appropriations we call earmarks. So if you tie them to jobs in your local economy, that seems like that's a defining way." Yet on Nov. 30, 2010, he was one of 39 senators to support waiving Senate rules to consider an earmark moratorium for fiscal years 2011, 2012 and 2013. The measure failed 56-39. That Nov. 30 vote also stands in contrast to a vote Nelson cast eight months earlier, according to Senate records. On March 16, 2010, Nelson was one of 68 senators to table a motion to ban earmarks for fiscal years 2010 and 2011. The motion was tabled by a vote of 68-29. Asked about the switch in positions by the St. Petersburg Times' Alex Leary, Nelson spokesman Dan McLaughlin said: "These are unusual (economic) times. ... Going forward Sen. Nelson will keep looking for ways to cut spending, while also fighting to make sure Florida gets its fair share of federal funding for things like ports, military bases and major projects that bring new jobs." Without a formal ban, Nelson -- who is up for reelection in 2012 -- is free to continue to pursue earmarks. But his Nov. 30 vote is an about-face from an earlier vote and his comments to reporters. So it's an easy call for our Flip-O-Meter. We say Full Flop.	None	Bill Nelson	None	None	None	2010-12-01T12:09:02	2010-11-30	['None']
pomt-06464	The 9-9-9 plan "does not raise taxes on those that are making the least."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/oct/18/herman-cain/herman-cain-says-9-9-9-plan-does-not-raise-taxes-t/	Herman Cain has offered what he calls a simple tax plan to take the place of the current tax code, which he says is too complicated. Cain, a Republican candidate for president, touts a 9-9-9 plan: a 9 percent income tax, a 9 percent sales tax and a 9 percent business tax. Cain’s plan has gotten more attention in recent days -- and more criticism. At the debate for the Republican nomination in Las Vegas on Oct. 18, 2011, moderator Anderson Cooper of CNN summarized those concerns. "Mr. Cain, a lot of prominent conservatives now are coming forward saying that your 9-9-9 plan would actually raise taxes on middle-class voters, on lower-income voters," Cooper said. "The thing that I would encourage people to do before they engage in this knee-jerk reaction is read our analysis. It is available at HerrmanCain.com," Cain said. "It was performed by Fiscal Associates. And all of the claims that are made against it, it is a jobs plan, it is revenue-neutral, it does not raise taxes on those that are making the least. All of those are simply not true." Here, we wanted to check Cain’s answer to Cooper’s question, that the plan "does not raise taxes on those that are making the least." We’ve been looking at Cain’s plan as part of our ongoing work fact-checking the Republican nomination contest. Based on what Cain and his campaign have said about the plan, the only exemptions on the income tax will be for charitable deductions and for undefined "empowerment" zones that would encourage development in inner cities. The 9 percent sales tax would apply to all new goods but not to used goods. Payroll taxes on workers would go away. If you pay no income tax currently -- and about half the country doesn’t -- Cain’s plan means you would pay more income tax. The day of the debate, a new analysis was published examining Cain’s tax plan. The analysis was published by the Tax Policy Center, an independent policy analysis group that includes tax analysts who have worked in both Democratic and Republican administrations. The Tax Policy Center analyzed Cain’s plan using the same type of models it has used to examine other national tax proposals. The analysis found that Cain’s tax plan would result in tax cuts for many of the wealthiest tax payers and tax increases for the poorest tax payers. The center found that 83.8 percent of tax filers would get a tax increase under Cain’s plan, compared with current tax policy. On the other hand, most of the tax filers who make more than $1 million would get a tax cut under the Cain plan, about 95.4 percent of this high income group. And the average tax cut for millionaires would be $487,300. The center also offered analysis of Cain’s plan by income level compared with current tax policy. Most people earning lower incomes would see a tax increase. Cash income Percentage of filers with a tax increase Less than $10,000 84.1 $10,000 to $20,000 97.8 $20,000 to $30,000 97.3 $30,000 to $40,000 94.9 $40,000 to $50,000 92.1 $50,000 to $75,000 83.7 We should note that the Tax Policy Center said it had to make a few assumptions about Cain’s plan in order to analyze the plan according to its standard economic model. So it’s possible Cain may release more details that could cause these estimates to change. Cain said the 9-9-9 plan "does not raise taxes on those that are making the least." But it would raise income taxes on people who now have low tax burdens due to exemptions and deductions. The Tax Policy Center analysis adds more detail and found that high percentages of lower-income tax filers would see tax increases. It’s true that Cain’s campaign may release more details on his plan that could change this picture. But knowing what we know now about the plan, we rate Cain’s statement False.

pomt-02953	"We’re second only to Boston in college students per capita."	false	/wisconsin/statements/2013/oct/27/chris-abele/chris-abele-says-milwaukee-area-trails-only-boston/	Chris Abele says he’s "one of the most unapologetically proud Milwaukeeans," pointing to things such as the lakefront festivals, Milwaukee Art Museum and the new Milwaukee Rotary Centennial Arboretum along the Milwaukee River. In an Oct. 1, 2013 speech to the Rotary Club of Milwaukee, the Milwaukee County executive had plenty more for the list. "We’re second only to Boston in college students per capita," Abele said. "We have low labor turnover, low absenteeism, low loan default, incredibly high volunteerism, and some industries that are placed in really strategic places." All sounds great. But what about those college students? In April of 2013, the Journal Sentinel reported the Milwaukee metropolitan area ranks about average in the share of residents with college degrees. All told, 31.4 percent of adults have degrees. But the area has more than 100,000 college students, from the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee to Marquette, Cardinal Stritch to Carroll, Alverno to the Milwaukee School of Engineering, the tech colleges and for-profits such as Bryant & Stratton College and DeVry University. The list goes on. Is it possible that the area ranks behind only Boston as a student hub? When we asked Abele for backup, his office said he was referring to 1996 data cited in a McGill University study of student concentrations in the 30 largest metro areas in the United States and Canada. However, Abele could not locate the actual study, which involves data from 17 years ago. We couldn’t either, nor could McGill officials. The closest we found was a Journal Sentinel story from 2000, when the study came out. It said the McGill study ranked the Milwaukee metro area sixth overall and fifth among U.S. metros in college students per capita. Boston was first in the United States (though it trailed Montreal in North America), followed by Denver, Minneapolis-St.Paul and Norfolk-Virginia Beach-Newport News. So, Milwaukee certainly ranked high, but Abele’s memory was off on Milwaukee’s specific rank. Around the same time, the Atlanta Regional Council for Higher Education found that Milwaukee ranked 13th among the top 50 largest metro areas. In any case, both studies are very outdated, and Abele’s claim was that Milwaukee ranks that high today. Here is a look at some more recent research: Middle among mid-size metros: Milwaukee ranked in the middle -- 16th of 30 -- among "mid-size metros" for student concentration in the 2013-’14 version of the American Institute for Economic Research’s annual "College Destinations Index." When looking at 229 metro areas with more than 15,000 students, Milwaukee ranked 134th in student concentration, the group’s spokesman Jon Sylbert said, quoting from statistics set for official release in late 2013. Abele, of course, could not have seen these rankings because they were not public. But last year’s AIER study was much the same story, ranking the Milwaukee metro area 14th among mid-size metros, and 123rd in the broader group. The latest AIER study used 2011 US Census data on enrollment. The Census defines college students as people attending a 4-year or 2-year college, university, or professional school, full time or part time, in courses that may advance the student toward a recognized college or university degree. Middle among top metros: Milwaukee ranked 23rd among the top 50 metro areas for student concentration, according to Kevin Stolarick, research director at The Martin Prosperity Institute at the University of Toronto. San Diego led, followed by Austin, Sacramento, Boston and San Jose, said Stolarick, who has studied student concentration and is a colleague of demographics expert Richard Florida. He also uses census data and definitions, but measures the number of college students against only the 15 and older population of an area. More broadly, Stolarick found that Milwaukee ranked 153rd of the 374 largest metro areas and 269th among 955 metros and smaller areas. So, the current research puts Milwaukee pretty far down the list. Behind the numbers Obviously such rankings can change depending on whether you include small "college towns" such as Ames, Iowa, home to Iowa State University, which had the highest student concentration according to the AIER study. The 2000 McGill study -- the one that cannot be located -- sought to eliminate those small college towns from the equation. But even if you take that approach with the more recent data, the Milwaukee metro area was nowhere near the top in concentration of students even among very large metro areas. For example, using the data from AIER, Milwaukee trails Boston, Miami, Richmond, Atlanta, Cincinnati, Buffalo, Raleigh, Philadelphia, Oklahoma City, Los Angeles, San Francisco, Baltimore, San Diego and others. So, what to make of the McGill study cited by Abele, and this area of research in general? Even Mark Michaud, an official in the office at McGill University that produced the study cited by Abele, urged caution. He told us he would question any rankings claims of this nature "since all it takes is some creative definition for either the numerator (who exactly are college students?) or the denominator (what exactly is a city’s population?)." Abele’s office also cited media accounts of growth in the number of college graduates moving to Milwaukee. But that doesn’t bear on Abele’s claim about current student enrollment. Our rating Abele said, "We’re second only to Boston in college students per capita." The county exec relies on decade-and-a-half-old data from a study that is no longer available and, in any event, does not back up his claim. A second dated study we found from 1996 put Milwaukee at 13th of 50. More recent research ranks the area far from the head of the class. We rate his claim False.

pomt-04724	In his first TV interview as president, Obama said we "should talk to Iran."	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/aug/31/mitt-romney/obama-first-interview-talk-iran/	The only good thing Mitt Romney had to say about President Barack Obama’s foreign policy record was he "gave the order, and Seal Team Six took out Osama bin Laden." From that point in Romney’s speech accepting the Republican Party presidential nomination, he quickly pivoted to zinging Obama for his policies on Israel, Cuba, Russia, Poland and, possibly worst of all, Iran. "On another front, every American is less secure today because he has failed to slow Iran's nuclear threat," Romney said on Aug. 30, 2012. "In his first TV interview as president, he said we should talk to Iran. We're still talking, and Iran’s centrifuges are still spinning." Here, we’re fact-checking whether Obama said we should "talk to Iran" in his first TV interview. Obama’s first interview as president came on Jan. 27, 2009, with Hisham Melhem, Washington bureau chief for Al Arabiya. The Dubai-based network is considered less radical than Al Jazeera. News organizations from the New York Times to the Washington Post to MSNBC billed it as his first formal TV interview in the White House. Obama, who pledged a much different approach with the Middle East than his predecessor, was coming off selecting former Maine Sen. George Mitchell as special envoy to the Middle East. He made calls on his first day in the Oval Office to Arab and Israeli leaders, we’ve noted in a previous fact-check. "My job to the Muslim world is to communicate that the Americans are not your enemy," the network quoted Obama as saying. The question about Iran’s nuclear status was the last one in the interview. Obama stressed diplomacy while frowning on Iran’s threats against Israel and its pursuit of a nuclear weapon that "could potentially set off an arms race in the region." Here is the full exchange, pulled from Al Arabiya’s 2009 story: Melhem: Will the United States ever live with a nuclear Iran? And if not, how far are you going in the direction of preventing it? Obama: You know, I said during the campaign that it is very important for us to make sure that we are using all the tools of U.S. power, including diplomacy, in our relationship with Iran. Now, the Iranian people are a great people, and Persian civilization is a great civilization. Iran has acted in ways that's not conducive to peace and prosperity in the region: their threats against Israel; their pursuit of a nuclear weapon which could potentially set off an arms race in the region that would make everybody less safe; their support of terrorist organizations in the past -- none of these things have been helpful. But I do think that it is important for us to be willing to talk to Iran, to express very clearly where our differences are, but where there are potential avenues for progress. And we will over the next several months be laying out our general framework and approach. And as I said during my inauguration speech, if countries like Iran are willing to unclench their fist, they will find an extended hand from us. Again, we’re not evaluating in this fact-check whether Obama’s policies on Iran have worked to slow Iran’s pursuit of nuclear weapons. But Obama said in his first presidential interview that we should "be willing to talk to Iran." Romney’s characterization of that interview is very close. We rate his claim True.

pomt-14021	Say video "shows massive alligator strolling across Florida golf course."	true	/florida/statements/2016/jun/01/blog-posting/massive-alligator-spotted-roaming-florida-golf-cou/	If you’ve seen the viral video of a giant alligator strolling across a Florida golf course, then you’ve probably had the same reaction we did: Can that be real? The video, originally posted by Charles Helms on his Facebook page Wednesday, May 25, shows a large alligator meandering across the fairway at Buffalo Creek Golf Course in Palmetto. The alligator is so big (some have estimated it to be around 15 feet), one of the watchers suspected it might be "two guys in an alligator suit." "I didn't know if we were being punked or something," Helms later told reporters. Helms’ video has since traveled the globe with similar expressions of shock and disbelief. It has been picked up by several news outlets including Golf.com, Time and The Guardian. The video posted on Golf.com’s YouTube account has 6.1 million views as of this writing. Someone even mashed up Helms’ video with scenes from Jurassic Park. So, is it real? We went to the Manatee County golf course to find out. Our hunt took us to Ken Powell, regional manager for Pope Golf. Powell oversees the 18-hole golf course. Powell said the video -- and the gator -- are indeed real. Powell, who moved to Florida five years ago, said the gator can most often be found roaming around holes 3, 8 and 14. You might see him several days in a row, or not at all for weeks, Powell said. "He could be there," Powell said. "He could not. You’re never going to know." He offered us a ride on a golf cart to try and spot the elusive beast. Ken Powell points to the reservoir where the alligator is often seen. (Photo by Allison Graves) As we traveled along the edges of the bodies of water, we kept our eyes peeled for alligators of any kind, and especially for the ragged back of the now-famous reptile poking out of the water. Powell pointed out where he’s seen the gator and noted that it often follows a path, from a creek near Hole 8 to the lake. Sometimes, the alligator hides in the nearby black culvert pipe feeding into the lake, Powell said. We opted not to poke our head in. The 150-acre golf course is home to many wildlife species and plant life. Powell estimates there are around 37 bird species and more than 150 plant and tree species. The golf course is open every day except Christmas, open to the public and costs about $25 to play in the summer. Estimates of the gator’s length vary. Helms told ABC Action News in Tampa that it was around 14- to 15-feet long. According to the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission, the Florida record for a gator is 14 feet, 3.5 inches. We drove around the 8th hole and to the 3rd and the 14th. No gator. We stared off into the lake looking for him, but we only saw a pack of vultures and a few unique birds that hung out near the water holes. Cool. But not what we were after. After a thorough search, no luck. Powell showed a video he took from a different perspective, which shows the gator crossing a golf cart path, which he said is around 6 feet. He said the gator's tail was around 7 to 8 feet in total, and the entire gator could be double the length of the tail. Powell said he doesn’t want to get any closer to say for certain. He also added that the golf course may have a contest to name the alligator. Frank Mazzotti, a professor and investigator for "The Croc Docs" at the University of Florida, said that a large Florida gator would typically stretch 10 to 12 feet. In his estimation from watching Helms’ video, Mazzotti said the gator was around 12 to 14 feet long. He said he doesn’t think it meets record size. Mazzotti also noted that the angle of the image could significantly alter how one measures it. Countering disbelievers arguing that the alligator is not real, Mazzotti pointed to its gait — a "high walk" — as characteristic of a large gator. "An alligator moving from pond to pond — large alligators will typically engage in that behavior," he said. "They will get up in all fours and walk in what I would call a stately fashion for an alligator, just dragging its tail a bit." Saddened not to see the mammoth gator, we prepared our goodbyes to Powell and thought about our drive home. Then, on our way out, right in front of the golf course, we spotted a darkish tail sitting in a shallow pond. Could it be? Could we have found it? As we inspected the water, the alligator outline became clear. We grabbed our phones, readied our camera. But it was just 2 feet long or so. Nothing worth writing about. Our ruling Bloggers went crazy over a viral video of a massive alligator on a Manatee County golf course, with many expressing skepticism about the video’s authenticity. After speaking with the course’s regional manager and a University of Florida gator expert (and seeing additional video of the gator), we can say this video holds up. We rate this claim as True. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/e08e2288-592d-478b-bf29-54b23a8da7a2	None	Bloggers	None	None	None	2016-06-01T16:48:29	2016-06-01	['None']
pomt-07891	Under Hosni Mubarak's rule, "Egypt received more American dollars than any country besides Israel."	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/feb/04/ross-douthat/egypt-got-more-foreign-aid-anyone-besides-israel-s/	Hosni Mubarak may have ruled Egypt with an iron fist since 1981, but he's been an important ally for the United States in the fight against terrorism -- or so the thinking goes. New York Times columnist Ross Douthat, though, questioned whether Mubarak has been as helpful as some believe. Mubarak, after all, led a regime that tortured political dissidents. "By visiting imprisonment, torture and exile upon Egypt's Muslim Brotherhood, Mubarak foreclosed any possibility of an Islamic revolution in his own country. But he also helped radicalize and internationalize his country's Islamists, pushing men like Ayman Al-Zawahiri — Osama bin Laden's chief lieutenant, and arguably the real brains behind Al Qaeda — out of Egyptian politics and into the global jihad," Douthat wrote. Douthat credited the book The Looming Tower, by Lawrence Wright, for documenting that history. "At the same time, Mubarak's relationship with Washington has offered constant vindication for the jihadi worldview," Douthat wrote. "Under his rule, Egypt received more American dollars than any country besides Israel. For many young Egyptians, restless amid political and economic stagnation, it's been a short leap from hating their dictator to hating his patrons in the United States." Douthat concluded his column by noting that a different government in Egypt might not necessarily be a good thing. "The long-term consequences of a more populist and nationalistic Egypt might be better for the United States than the stasis of the Mubarak era, and the terrorism that it helped inspire. But then again they might be worse. There are devils behind every door," he wrote. We were interested in Douthat's statement about aid to Egypt. He is correct based on the most recent statistics. If you don't count Afghanistan ($8.9 billion) and Iraq ($7.5 billion) because of the ongoing U.S. military operations, then Israel ($2.4 billion) is indeed the top recipient, followed by Egypt ($1.5 billion). That's followed by Russia ($1.3 billion), Sudan ($1.2 billion), Tanzania ($1.1 billion), Ethiopia ($1 billion), Pakistan ($963 million), Colombia ($888 million), Jordan ($833 million), and Mozambique ($799 million). We found these ratings in the U.S. Census 2011 Statistical Abstract, which compiled 2008 military and economic aid. Foreign aid includes things such as money for economic development, agriculture or children's health. In Egypt's case, most of the money in recent years has gone to military aid, particularly heavy equipment such as tanks, helicopters and fighter planes. We should note that Egypt will likely slip a place when the official 2010 figures are released, according to a report in the Boston Globe. Haiti is expected to receive more aid, because of the earthquake that occurred there in 2010. The Globe also reported that much of the aid the U.S. sends to Egypt comes back to the United States when Egypt purchases weapons from U.S. defense manufacturers. Still, Douthat wrote that Egypt has received more money than any country besides Israel "under his rule." That would mean the 30 years since Mubarak came to power in late 1981. We turned to the same source the Statistical Abstract used, the U.S. Overseas Loans and Grants data as collected in the "Greenbook." The Greenbook, which is compiled by the U.S. Agency for International Development, provides "a complete historical record of United States' (U.S.) foreign aid to the rest of the world by reporting all loans and grants authorized by the U.S. Government for each fiscal year," according to its site. We obtained aid data by country, calculated in inflation-adjusted 2009 U.S. dollars, from 1982 to 2009. This time, Israel ($117.6 billion) was number one, followed by Egypt ($83.7 billion) at number two. Rounding out the top 10 were Iraq ($54.4 billion), Afghanistan ($35.2 billion), Russia ($18.1 billion), Pakistan ($18 billion), Turkey ($16.7 billion), Jordan ($11.2 billion), Sudan ($10.3 billion), and Colombia ($10.3 billion). For our ruling, we wanted to know if Douthat was correct that under Mubarak's rule, Egypt received more American dollars than any country besides Israel. Douthat is right. We rate his statement True.

pomt-10572	"George Bush sent people to war without body armor."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/feb/04/hillary-clinton/50000-started-war-without-body-armor/	In the Democratic debate in Los Angeles on Jan. 31, 2008, Sen. Hillary Clinton criticized the Bush administration for failing to give American soldiers in Iraq the resources they require. She leveled this accusation: "We had to fight to get body armor. You know, George Bush sent people to war without body armor." The issue of body armor — who gets it and whether it's the right kind — has been a source of intense scrutiny nearly from the start of the war in Iraq. A March 7, 2005, story in the New York Times by reporter Michael Moss detailed a deadly miscalculation by the military near the start of the war in April 2003. Army Gen. Richard A. Cody decided to stop buying bulletproof vests after a determination that some 50,000 soldiers not on the front lines could do without them. In the following weeks, Moss wrote, "Iraqi snipers and suicide bombers stepped up deadly attacks, often directed at those very soldiers behind the front lines." Cody quickly ordered bulletproof vests for every soldier. But it took 167 days to start getting those vests to soldiers due to production and paperwork delays. Some soldiers waited months more. Many soldiers heading to Iraq bought their own body armor despite assurances from the military that it would be provided. In April 2005, the Government Accountability Office reported on shortages of critical force protection items, including individual body armor. The problems were caused, the report concluded, due to materials shortages, production limitations and distribution problems. But by and large, everyone eventually got body armor. In ensuing years, the issue became whether the military was using the right kind. In January 2006, the New York Times cited a secret Pentagon study that found that as many as 80 percent of the Marines killed in Iraq from wounds to the upper body could have survived if they had body armor that reached a soldier's shoulders, sides and torso. In March 2007, Clinton and fellow Democratic Sen. Jim Webb of Virginia sent a letter to the Comptroller of the United States, calling on him to initiate a GAO investigation to reassess the body armor systems used by the military. The following month, the GAO issued a report, which concluded that "Army and Marine Corps body armor is currently meeting theater ballistic requirements and the required amount needed for personnel in theater, including the amounts needed for the surge of troops in Iraq." Nevertheless, with emerging technology and debate over the best type of body armor, the GAO is reassessing body armor, said Roger Charles, vice chairman of the nonpartisan Soldiers for the Truth Foundation, which has been at the forefront of the body armor debate. Clinton's comment about troops heading into war without body armor, while it wasn't true for all, was true for some soldiers at the beginning of the war. So we rate Clinton's comment Mostly True.

pomt-10447	Tax rates were significantly higher "in the '40s, the '50s, and the '60s."	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/may/02/hillary-clinton/rates-were-a-lot-higher-back-in-the-day/	In a free-wheeling interview on the Fox News Network, Bill O'Reilly and Hillary Clinton mixed it up over gas prices, health care, and taxes. On taxes, Clinton and O'Reilly argued about what tax rates were like when their fathers were working. Clinton: "You were growing up on Long Island. I was growing up outside of Chicago. You know, my dad got up every day. He was a small business man. He worked his head off, but he didn't feel like the deck was stacked against him. He thought, OK, I'm going to be treated fairly if I do my part." O'Reilly: "Here's where you're wrong. In my neighborhood, Levittown, there was no income distribution at all. There was earning money. And you kept most of it because taxes were really low." Clinton: "That is not true. Look at the tax rates in the '40s, the '50s, and the '60s." O'Reilly: "For the wealthy they were high, but not for my dad." Clinton: "Well, so why don't we go back to what we had in the '50s and the '60s then? Go back to 70 percent..." O'Reilly: "Because there were no wealthy people then. There were very, very few." Clinton: "When President Kennedy made that dramatic announcement he was going to cut the top rate from 90 percent to 70 percent, people stood up and cheered. All I want to do is get back to what worked in the '90s." We wondered who was right in this exchange and what the tax rates were when Clinton and O'Reilly were young. Today, tax rates range from 10 percent for lower incomes to 35 percent for the highest incomes. (See a chart of tax rates over time from the Tax Foundation here .) Kennedy urged tax cuts that went into effect in 1964. Prior to that, tax rates started at 20 percent for the lowest bracket and went up to 91 percent for the highest bracket. The rates were similar throughout the 1940s and 1950s. We looked at incomes and tax rates in 1963, then adjusted for inflation and looked at today's tax rates. We found: * A person making $2,500 a year in 1963 was taxed at 22 percent. Today that would be $17,445, taxed at 15 percent. * A person making $5,000 a year in 1963 was taxed at 26 percent. Today that would be $34,890, taxed at 25 percent. * A person making $10,000 a year in 1963 was taxed at 34 percent. Today that would be $69,780, taxed at 25 percent. * A person making $15,000 a year in 1963 was taxed at 47 percent. Today that would be $104,670, taxed at 28 percent. * A person making $25,000 a year in 1963 was taxed at 59 percent. Today that would be $174,450, taxed at 33 percent. The 1963 rates are higher than today's rates. It's true that the tax code is substantially different today, with many credits and rules that didn't exist then. But on the question of income tax rates, we find that Hillary Clinton has her history right. We rate her statement True.	None	Hillary Clinton	None	None	None	2008-05-02T00:00:00	2008-04-30	['None']

"Bill Clinton’s hitman confesses on his deathbed," stated a Jan. 8 headline on The Patriot Report. Facebook users flagged the post as being potentially fabricated, as part of the social network’s efforts to combat fake news. We found that this story, which has circulated on multiple websites, lacks any evidence and is filled with ridiculous, made-up statements. The story’s only source is an alleged intern -- unnamed -- who interviewed the alleged hitman on behalf of Fox News’ Sean Hannity. The story said that the hitman who operated under the alias Wilshire Williams (but was actually named Terrence Wilekenmeyer) was a low-level runner for the mafia until he was sold to Clinton in exchange for 12 cases of confiscated Arkansas moonshine. But now dying of pancreatic cancer with one week left to live, the hitman wanted to come clean and told his story to the Fox News intern. The intern allegedly told The Patriot News that the hitman "put three bullets in Vince Foster and two in Seth Rich. He tied up more loose ends than any other hitman in history." Foster was the former White House counsel who committed suicide in 1993. Rich was the Democratic National Committee worker who was murdered in 2016. Both deaths have been the subject of conspiracy theories. We noticed that the supposed real name of the hitman -- Terrence Wilekenmeyer -- was the same last name as Ezekiel Wilekenmeyer, a pen name used by one of the biggest purveyors of fake news, Christopher Blair. A Fox News spokeswoman Jaclyn Giuliano said that Hannity had no involvement whatsoever in the story alleging a Clinton hit man confessed on his deathbed. The Patriot Report’s website claims that it offers "solid conservative perspective on the issues of the day" and aims to "to equip the current generation of American Patriots with the right information" to support and defend the unalienable rights of man. We find that the website posts fake news. We sent a message to The Patriot Report on Facebook and did not hear back. A headline said that "Bill Clinton’s hitman confesses on his deathbed." There is no evidence that such a confessing hitman exists. We rate this story Pants on Fire.

pomt-13691	"Only five Texas counties account for almost 90 percent of the (state’s) cattle industry."	false	/texas/statements/2016/jul/29/jeannette-vaught/researcher-rounds-wrong-figure-texas-cattle/	From the citrus of the Rio Grande Valley to the peaches of the Texas Hill Country, many crops flourish across the vast expanse of the Lone Star State. Ask just about anybody about Texas agriculture, however, and the first offering that often comes to mind is beef. In a May 4, 2016 op-ed article in the Austin American-Statesman, University of Texas lecturer Jeannette Vaught suggested that’s not coincidental. Her dissertation on the same subject is being published as a book. She argued that the promotion of beef culture, in part by politicians such as the Texas Agriculture Commissioner Sid Miller, means it’s recognized as the epitome of Texas agriculture. Even though, she writes, it hails predominantly from one part of the state and economically benefits a small region. This obscures the actual diversity of agricultural production in Texas, she said. Vaught wrote that only five counties out of the state’s 254 account for almost 90 percent of the state’s cattle industry. With almost any drive beyond the state’s urban areas incomplete without a few cow sightings, we wondered if the state’s beef cattle are concentrated in just a few counties. Vaught, asked to provide factual backup, said she relied on Texas statistics posted by the National Agricultural Statistics Service in the U.S. Department of Agriculture. "It's arresting," Vaught said by email, "because cows are visible everywhere! But they are super concentrated in feedlots in the counties surrounding Lubbock." Feedlots are designated lots of land where cattle are given a specific type of feed before slaughter. We sought to check on the data on the NASS Quick Stats website, learning that the agency annually surveys some 38,000 cattle producers to gauge the state of the country’s cattle industry by mail, phone, online and in face-to-face interviews. For the 2015 survey behind Vaught’s claim, producers were asked to report cattle inventories based on Jan. 1, 2016 counts. To our inquiry, Michael Klamm, a cattle statistician with NASS, walked us through the database to those latest counts. Separately, we reached out to the Southwestern Cattle Raisers Association, the largest and oldest livestock association in the state, to see if Vaught’s claim sounded familiar. Laramie Adams, director of public affairs for the group, told us by phone that the NASS data is the complete source for cattle data. We checked back with Klamm at NASS, who wrote back that the inventory category we used included all cattle, both dairy and beef cattle. From our analysis, the five counties with the largest cattle counts (Deaf Smith, Castro, Parmer, Hartley and Hansford), as of January 2016 had a total of 1,980,000 head of cattle out of a total 11,700,000 in the state, or 16.9 percent. While those counties lie in the state’s Panhandle region, at most a three-hour drive from Lubbock, the counties don’t account for anywhere close to the 90 percent Vaught tied to just five counties. By our calculation, the federally collected counts place 90 percent of Texas cattle across 157 counties, spread from regions that include the Panhandle, Blackland Prairies and Cross Timbers region in north and central Texas, to name a few. We circled back to Vaught with our findings. When she checked the NASS state facts, she advised, she misread a map that mapped out cattle counts by county and, Vaught said, "neglected to break down the math step by step, and made a terribly under-informed estimate that supported my initial assumption that feedlots in North Texas concentrated cattle at rates far higher than the rest of the state." Still, Vaught said, five counties accounting for 16.9 percent is "still significant, given that there are 254 counties in Texas, each one reporting cattle inventory." Our ruling Vaught wrote that only five Texas counties account for 90 percent of the state’s cattle industry. However, after checking with the USDA National Agricultural Statistics Service and looking at the most recent inventory, we found the percentage to be far lower. We rate this claim False. FALSE – The statement is not accurate. Click here for more on the six PolitiFact ratings and how we select facts to check.

pomt-05825	"The Republicans just voted last year to end Medicare."	false	/new-jersey/statements/2012/feb/19/steve-rothman/congressman-steve-rothman-claims-republicans-just-/	Fact-checkers across the country have debunked the claim numerous times over the last year, but that didn’t stop U.S. Rep. Steve Rothman from shouting these nine words during a recent debate on the House floor: "The Republicans just voted last year to end Medicare." Democrats have been making similar claims since the Republican-controlled House signed off in April 2011 on a Medicare reform proposal advanced by U.S. Rep. Paul Ryan (R-Wisconsin). Rothman (D-9th Dist.) made that accusation -- and then repeated it -- during a Feb. 8 debate about extending the payroll tax cut. But repeating a falsehood still doesn’t make it right, Congressman. PolitiFact New Jersey found that Ryan’s plan would dramatically restructure Medicare, but it wouldn’t eliminate the program. Also, the proposed changes would not affect current Medicare beneficiaries or others who turn 65 years old before 2022. Our PolitiFact colleagues have issued False or Pants on Fire rulings to versions of this Medicare claim in nine separate fact-checks, ultimately designating it as the 2011 Lie of the Year. Two other fact-checking groups -- FactCheck.org and The Washington Post’s Fact Checker -- also said the claim was inaccurate. Rothman spokesman Aaron Keyak said in an email that the congressman stands by his statement. "Right now, every senior citizen is guaranteed comprehensive medical care under Medicare," Keyak wrote. "The Republican plan authored by Congressman Paul Ryan (R-WI), and approved by the House Republican Majority on April 15, 2011, would end this guarantee for everyone under age 55 and replace it with a voucher system that would cover only a portion of the cost of buying health insurance." Let’s explain how the Ryan proposal would change Medicare. Under the traditional Medicare program, which is available to anyone 65 or older, the government pays health care providers directly for services. Beneficiaries must bear the cost of deductibles and coinsurance. Ryan called for converting the Medicare program to a privatized system, starting with people who turn 65 years old beginning in 2022. Under that system, the government would provide "premium support payments" to help beneficiaries purchase private health insurance. According to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, most beneficiaries would pay more for health care through the proposed program than under the current Medicare system. In April 2011, the House approved a budget resolution containing Ryan’s proposal, but the Democrat-controlled U.S. Senate later rejected it. Now, let’s point out two problems with Rothman’s claim. First, Ryan’s proposal would not affect current Medicare beneficiaries or people who were at least 55 years old by the end of 2011 and later sign up for Medicare. Secondly, Medicare would still exist under the proposal, just in a very different form. Federal dollars would still be subsidizing people’s health care. The Ryan plan "would potentially have major changes in how Medicare operates and who bears the financial costs of the program, but it would not literally do away with the program," Thomas Oliver, a professor of Population Health Sciences at the University of Wisconsin School of Medicine and Public Health, said in an email. Joel Cantor, director of the Center for State Health Policy at Rutgers University, agreed that the Ryan plan would maintain a Medicare program, but told us the proposal "would end the government program that most people think of when we say ‘Medicare.’" "Bottom line, in my view, is that the quote from Cong. Rothman is hyperbole, but has (a) thread of truth," Cantor said in an email, later adding that the congressman’s "comment is an over-statement of the impact of the Ryan plan on Medicare." Our ruling In a speech on the House floor, Rothman repeated a claim that’s been debunked many times before: "The Republicans just voted last year to end Medicare." Republicans approved a dramatic restructuring of the Medicare program, but that plan would not "end Medicare." The program would remain in existence, and the proposed changes would not affect current beneficiaries or others who turn 65 years old before 2022. We rate the statement False.

pomt-11917	"In the eight years that I was mayor, (there was a) nearly 50 percent drop in violent crime, gang crime — crime went down because we grew our police department, we focused on constitutional community policing, we did some of the most innovative prevention, intervention, job re-entry programs in the nation."	mostly true	/california/statements/2017/oct/18/antonio-villaraigosa/did-las-violent-crime-drop-nearly-half-during-vill/	During his time as mayor of Los Angeles and now in his campaign for California governor, Antonio Villaraigosa has repeatedly highlighted the city’s drop in violent crime. Villaraigosa, one of the top Democrats vying to succeed Gov. Jerry Brown in 2018, spoke in detail in a late July interview on MSNBC about LA’s reduction in violent crime and the steps he claims led to that result. "In the eight years that I was mayor, (there was a) nearly 50 percent drop in violent crime, gang crime — crime went down because we grew our police department, we focused on constitutional community policing, we did some of the most innovative prevention, intervention, job re-entry programs in the nation." Villaraigosa makes his claim on MSNBC at about the 0:50 minute mark here. He made a similar claim on Capital Public Radio on October 4, 2017. "When I was mayor of Los Angeles … we reduced our violent crime rate by 49 percent." We wanted to know whether Villaraigosa’s claim about this big drop in violent crime stood up to the facts. We also wanted to know whether there was evidence supporting his explanation that growing the police force and focusing on community policing really led to the decline. We set out on a fact check. Our research To support the claim, Villaraigosa’s campaign pointed us to crime statistics and past news articles discussing the former mayor’s crime initiatives. We started by reviewing FBI crime data. Here’s what we found: According to the FBI’s Uniform Crime Reporting Statistics, the LAPD reported the violent crime rate per 100,000 people declined from 820.6 in 2005 -- the year Villaraigosa took office -- to 426 in 2013, the year he left office. That represents a 48 percent reduction in the violent crime rate, homicide, rape, robbery and assaults. That matches with his claim of a "nearly 50 percent drop in violent crime" made on MSNBC in late July. It also tracks with his more recent statement on Capital Public Radio. In addition to looking at the violent crime rate, we also reviewed the raw number of reported violent crimes over Villaraigosa’s tenure. That total was nearly cut in half from 31,767 in 2005 to 16,524 in 2013, LAPD statistics show. Beyond the numbers Charis Kubrin, a professor of criminology, law and society at the University of California at Irvine, reviewed Villaraigosa’s claim at our request and told us "the numbers do check out." Kubrin added, however, that the more difficult challenge is determining how much of an impact Villaraigosa’s initiatives had on crime. "It’s noteworthy that violent crime was going down well before 2005," Kubrin said. "So there’s some question as to whether these are continuing trends or there’s something new about the time period he went into office." For some perspective, violent crimes in LA dropped nearly 50 percent in the decade before Villaraigosa was elected mayor. They totaled nearly 73,000 in 1992 and had decreased to less than 38,000 by 2002. Who gets credit? Robert Stern, former president of the Los Angeles-based Center for Governmental Studies, said Villaraigosa should get some credit for his successful push to hire hundreds of new LAPD officers. But, Stern said, "The main credit has to go to the police chief Bill Bratton. And also the fact that what we saw across the country was a reduction in crime in almost all the major cities. So, it was a trend that LA participated in. But I think the mayor can claim some credit at least for increasing the police force." Violent crime rates fell by 50 percent nationwide from the early 1990s through 2015, according to an analysis of data compiled by the Pew Research Center. Looking at another large city, New York, during the specific period of Villaraigosa’s tenure, we found only a 7 percent decline in the violent crime rate. But looking at a broader period, from 1995 through 2013, New York saw a nearly 60 percent decline. Breaking from the long-term trend, California and the nation saw an increase in violent crime rates in 2016 and 2015, according to state and national figures. Criminologists credit factors from the economy to demographic changes to incarceration rates for driving crime trends nationally and in California. As mayor, Villaraigosa had limited influence over many of these factors. Kubrin said Villaraigosa’s expansion of the police force, by itself, was probably not the main driving force behind the crime reduction. Instead, she cited the strategy executed by the police as a more important element. The LAPD’s focus on community policing and crime prevention and intervention during Villaraigosa’s tenure likely helped reduce crime, Kubrin said. Researchers have found those police strategies are likely to reduce crime, the professor added, though their impact is limited. Praise from LAPD chief Villaraigosa’s campaign additionally pointed to praise from current LAPD Chief Charlie Beck in a 2013 Los Angeles Daily News article. Beck was paraphrased in the article as saying the violent crime drop during Villaraigosa’s tenure was "unprecedented." Beck "attributed it largely to the outgoing mayor’s steadfast commitment — even during the Great Recession — to expand the LAPD during his tenure," the article said. Beck said the mayor’s public safety strategy was effective, the article continued, "because it also included diverting at-risk youth from gangs; recruiting gang members to prevent conflicts between rival gangs from flaring up; and handing out grocery store gift cards in exchange for guns." LAPD statistics on gang crime during Villaraigosa’s tenure were not immediately available. In his statement on MSNBC, the former mayor specifically cited gang crime as one category of violent crime that had dropped. News articles generally back up this statement. An investigation by VICE News in 2015, however, sheds light on a more nuanced change in LA gang crime in recent years. It found that while "gang crime is down in the city, many experts cautioned that gangs haven't disappeared." "Gang members and gangs altogether have gone underground, pure and simple," Jorja Leap, a UCLA professor who researches gangs and criminal justice, told VICE News. She noted that social media has allowed gang members to retreat indoors, and that they have become more involved in lucrative illicit activities such as human trafficking. "They have not disappeared but become more knowledgeable." Our ruling Villaraigosa’s claim about a nearly 50 percent drop in violent crime during his time as LA mayor is backed up by LAPD crime statistics. His explanation for why this drop in crime took place is more difficult to evaluate. Experts we spoke with noted that violent crime had been falling well before Villaraigosa took office. They also said that key factors that drive crime trends, such as the economy, changing demographics and incarceration rates, are largely out of the control of a mayor. Villaraigosa’s statement does not include this context. Still, the mayor’s successful push to hire hundreds of new LAPD officers and focus on community policing is generally accepted as having, at the very least, some impact on reducing crime in the city. Additionally, the current LAPD chief has praised Villaraigosa's strategies for reducing gang violence, saying they helped reduce violent crime. We rate Villaraigosa’s claim Mostly True.

pomt-14556	"Don't believe those phony numbers when you hear 4.9 and 5 percent unemployment. The number's probably 28, 29, as high as 35. In fact, I even heard recently 42 percent."	pants on fire!	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/feb/11/donald-trump/donald-trump-repeats-pants-fire-claim-unemployment/	During his victory speech after the New Hampshire primary, Donald Trump repeated a claim he’d made several times before. "Don't believe those phony numbers when you hear 4.9 and 5 percent unemployment," Trump said. "The number's probably 28, 29, as high as 35. In fact, I even heard recently 42 percent." Actually, Trump’s the one who shouldn’t be believed. Numbers that high are not even close to accurate. To understand why, let’s start by discussing how the official unemployment rate is calculated. The Bureau of Labor Statistics, a federal agency, uses surveys and statistical sampling to calculate how many Americans do or don’t work. To calculate the unemployment rate, the agency divides the number of people who are out of work (counting only those who have recently looked for work) by the sum of the job-seeking and job-holding population. During the most recent month -- January 2016 -- the unemployment rate was 4.9 percent, its lowest level since February 2008. Not factored into this calculation, however, are people who are not currently looking for work. This is a longstanding concern for economists, because at least some of those people who aren’t looking for work right now might prefer to be looking for work but don’t feel they have a shot in the current job market. To ease such concerns, the bureau also produces a statistic with a more expansive definition of what it calls "labor underutilization." This statistic is known by the wonky shorthand "U-6." The U-6 rate includes both those who are officially "unemployed" and those who are working part time for economic reasons and those who are "marginally attached" to the work force, meaning they want to work but have not looked for work recently enough to count as being actively in the labor force. Currently the U-6 rate is 9.9 percent, about double the official unemployment rate. But that’s also its lowest level since May 2008. It’s possible to argue that the U-6 rate offers a fairer way of encapsulating the unemployment picture; some mainstream economists are sympathetic to that argument. But where Trump goes off the rails is in suggesting that the "real" unemployment rate is somewhere between 28 percent and 42 percent. Why? He’s including a ton of Americans not expected to be working. Let’s explore this point further. The source of Trump’s 42 percent figure appears to be a column by David Stockman, who served as President Ronald Reagan’s budget director. Stockman calculated that there are currently 210 million Americans between the ages of 16 and 68 -- what he calls a "plausible measure of the potential workforce." If you assume that each of those people is able to hold down a full-time job, he wrote, they would offer a total of 420 billion potential working hours. However, during 2014, Stockman noted, only 240 billion working hours were actually recorded by the Bureau of Labor Statistics. If you run the numbers, "the real unemployment rate was 42.9 percent," Stockman wrote. Economists say Stockman’s way of looking at the question -- using actual hours worked divided by a theoretical maximum that could have been worked, rather than determining whether individual people are employed or unemployed -- is provocative. But they say this raw measurement has serious flaws. Indeed, in his column, Stockman acknowledges that this figure is imperfect, even though his tone is flip when he does so. "Yes, we have to allow for non-working wives, students, the disabled, early retirees and coupon clippers," he wrote. "We also have drifters, grifters, welfare cheats, bums and people between jobs, enrolled in training programs, on sabbaticals and much else." Snark aside, economists say this caveat is crucial. Stockman’s calculation "treats people voluntarily working part-time hours as partly unemployed, even if they have excellent reasons for wanting to hold only a part-time job, such as rearing children, attending school or college, being disabled, or transitioning into retirement," said Gary Burtless, an economist at the Brookings Institution. "A lot of the shortfall between full-time and part-time employment is perfectly reasonable, as is a potential worker’s decision not to work or look for paid work at all." In other words, Trump’s faith in the accuracy of the 42 percent figure is misplaced. So is there a plausible calculation that can get us to 42 percent? The short answer is no. To see why, let’s start with the number of Americans age 16 and up who are not either (1) employed, (2) unemployed, (3) in the military or (4) institutionalized. That gives us 94 million "non-working" Americans. We then subtracted the number of people who have good reasons not to be working or looking for work. • People age 16 to 19 who are not in the labor force: Subtract 10.8 million • People age 65 and up who are not in the labor force: Subtract 38.4 million • Students, age 20-24: Subtract 8.7 million • Students, age 25-29: Subtract 2.9 million • Students, age 30-34: Subtract 1.4 million • Stay-at-home moms: Subtract 10.4 million • Stay at-home dads: Subtract 2 million • Those receiving disability checks: Subtract 8.9 million So what remains? By this calculation, there are 10.5 million Americans who do not have obvious reasons for not working. If you were to use these numbers to create a new type of "unemployment" rate -- call it "U-7" if you like -- it would come out to 15.6 percent. That’s higher than the U-6 rate of 9.9 percent, but it’s only a fraction of the 42 percent Trump claimed. This isn’t a perfect calculation. There’s probably some double-counting, and there could be good reasons why some of those 10.5 million Americans aren’t working, such as being a full-time student between the ages of 34 and 65, undergoing job training, or being affluent enough to be able to forgo work or retire early. Some might argue that students shouldn’t get off so easy because they should be able to handle a job along with their studies, or that we should set a higher retirement-age cutoff than 65. Quibble with the numbers if you like, but this is a solid enough back-of-the envelope calculation to show how wildly inaccurate Trump’s claim is. And remember, we are deliberately stretching the numbers here as an intellectual exercise; we are not saying that 15.6 percent is a more accurate unemployment rate than the official one of 4.9 percent. There’s even a silver lining to the current state of affairs, Burtless said. Most of those suffering from being "out of work" by Trump's definition can actually be seen as benefiting from their membership in an affluent, technologically advanced society. The fact that millions of adults are what Trump would term "jobless," he said, "is not a marker of economic failure -- it is an indicator of a very prosperous society that can afford to permit the old and disabled to retire, that can invest in young adults so they can improve their skills, and that can keep some adults in the home where they can care for children or attend to other non-paying pursuits." Our ruling Trump said, "Don't believe those phony numbers when you hear 4.9 and 5 percent unemployment. The number's probably 28, 29, as high as 35. In fact, I even heard recently 42 percent." While economists say that there are other, more expansive calculations of unemployment or under-employment, none of the official ones are currently higher than 9.9 percent, and the highest credible number we could calculate was 15.6 percent. That’s far, far lower than 42 percent -- or even 28 percent. We rate the claim Pants on Fire.	None	Donald Trump	None	None	None	2016-02-11T18:33:01	2016-02-09	['None']
pomt-07877	The city building code violations on my properties only involve exterior issues; "within the households, it’s fine."	pants on fire!	/wisconsin/statements/2011/feb/07/lee-holloway/milwaukee-county-board-chairman-lee-holloway-says-/	The condition of rental property owned by Milwaukee County Board Chairman Lee Holloway has become an issue in the race for county executive. Indeed, Holloway says media coverage of the issue has diminished his chances to win the contest. Holloway and his wife, Lynda, own 15 parcels in the city, including several apartment buildings on the near north side. Some of the buildings have been the subject of numerous and repeated building code violations. Holloway was ordered to Milwaukee Municipal Court because a large batch of the violations have not been corrected. That hearing, involving dozens of long-standing violations, is set for March of 2011. Beyond that, a security guard at one building faces misdemeanor charges for accusing him of threatening a tenant who was at odds with Holloway; another tenant faces charges of trashing that same tenant’s apartment; and reports show more than 800 police calls to Holloway-owned buildings in the past two years. So ears perked up at a candidate forum at the Marquette University Law School when Holloway -- who was serving as acting county executive at the time -- was asked about his record as a landlord. He compared the dire economic situation facing some of his tenants with the economic woes facing the state and county government, then described the problems. "The code violations are primarily storm windows," Holloway said, adding "which we take and provide plastic which is better than storm windows." He added: "And it has to do with tuckpointing, which is all complete." And he said: "Within the households, it’s fine." Finally, he declared: "I’m saying I have resolved these problems. We are working to resolve these problems." This one is easy enough to check. We looked at the city’s online database available through the Department of Neighborhood Services. Each violation for each property is listed. We counted, and then counted again. At the time he made the statement, Holloway had 200 outstanding violations on eight of his 15 properties. Some of the violations were new -- and written up on Jan. 21, 2011, the same day as the candidate forum. Do they all relate to exterior issues, such as brickwork, as Holloway claimed? No. Some examples of properties and violations listed: 2061 W. Atkinson Ave.: Fire extinguishers, door security hardware, faulty intercom, smoke detectors, carpeting, and damaged ceiling plaster. Other violations for the building include tuckpointing, parking lot repair, windows, screens and downspouts. 2041 W. Atkinson Ave.: Roaches, exit signs, ceiling plaster, floor covering, electrical fixtures, toilet, bathtub replacement. 2021 W. Atkinson Ave.: Fixtures, floor coverings, shower door. 2022 W. Atkinson Ave.: Windows, screens, outdoor canopy, downspouts, handrails and porch issues were cited. And this mention was included: "Restore ext. door frame to rodent proof condition." Let’s return to Holloway’s statement. Facing a date in Municipal Court, Holloway told a forum audience -- including those who watched on TV and YouTube -- that the building code violations still at issue involve the exterior of the properties. "Within the households," he said, "it’s fine." But inspection records paint a different picture: Roaches, exit signs, smoke detectors, ceiling plaster. All of those -- and more -- are interior issues. There’s even a note about faulty fire extinguishers. That seems appropriate. We rate Holloway’s statement Pants on Fire.

pomt-10285	"It (Georgia) was one of the earliest Christian nations. The king of then-Georgia in the third century converted to Christianity."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/aug/19/john-mccain/mccain-hits-the-mark-on-georgian-history-more-or-l/	Sen. John McCain, trying to make a case at a church forum that Americans should feel protective of the former Soviet republic of Georgia, cited its significance in Christian history. "I am very saddened here to be with you and talk about Russian re-emergence in the centuries-old ambition of the Russian Empire to dominate that part of the world," McCain told the Rev. Rick Warren at Saddleback Valley Community Church in California on Aug. 16, 2008. "Killings, murder, villages are being burned, people are being wantonly ejected from their homes. The latest figures from human rights organizations — 118,000 people in that small country. It was one of the earliest Christian nations. The king of then-Georgia in the third century converted to Christianity." McCain characterized Georgia similarly on other occasions. "Georgia is an ancient country, at the crossroads of Eastern Europe and Central Asia, and one of the world's first nations to adopt Christianity as an official religion," McCain said in a campaign statement on Aug. 11, 2008. It is true that what is now Eastern Georgia, then known as Kartli, adopted Christianity quite early. St. Nino , the Apostle of Georgia, introduced Christianity to the country in the 300s, converting King Marian III in 314, according to Ronald Suny, a professor of history at the University of Michigan and author of the 1988 book The Making of the Georgian Nation. "When the king converted he forced everyone else to become Christian," Suny said. "That's the year before the Roman Empire became Christian." So yes, Georgia was indeed an early adopter of Christianity. Note, however, this did not happen in the third century as McCain said. The first century lasted through the year 100, the second through 200, and the third through 300. Georgia became a Christian state in 314, which was the fourth century. Also, scholars quibble with McCain's use of the word "nation." In common parlance and under some dictionary definitions, a nation can be any territorial division. But a more subtle understanding is a group of people who believe they are entitled to some form of political representation, and thus give authority and legitimacy to a government. This concept arose in the 18th and 19th centuries. Prior to that, there were empires, dynastic states, theocracies, kingdoms and so forth, but not nations. "To claim that whatever entity 'Georgia' may have been in the third century was a 'nation' is factually anachronistic," John Pilch, a professor of biblical literature at Georgetown University told us in an e-mail exchange. (Furthermore, he said, the word "Christian" was not fashionable at the time of the Georgian king's conversion — Christians at that time might have referred to themselves as "followers of the Way.") These are quibbles though. A fair reading of the thrust of McCain's claim is that the place we call Georgia was an early adopter of Christianity, and that's true. He didn't use the word "nation" perfectly and he flubbed his centuries, but his claim is still Mostly True.

pomt-12159	"United Nations Resolution is the single largest economic sanctions package ever on North Korea. Over one billion dollars in cost to N.K."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2017/aug/06/donald-trump/trump-claims-un-sanctions-cost-north-korea-over-1-/	President Donald Trump applauded a new resolution passed by the United Nations Security Council to impose sanctions against North Korea and labeled it as the largest economic punishment yet on the nation. "The United Nations Security Council just voted 15-0 to sanction North Korea. China and Russia voted with us. Very big financial impact!" Trump tweeted Aug. 5. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com He detailed the impact in a follow-up tweet: "United Nations Resolution is the single largest economic sanctions package ever on North Korea. Over one billion dollars in cost to N.K." See Figure 2 on PolitiFact.com Trump has sought China’s help to deal with security threats from North Korea’s nuclear weapons program and has called on other nations to join the United States in implementing sanctions against North Korea. On Aug. 5, the United Nations Security Council unanimously adopted a resolution to prohibit certain exports from North Korea, among other economic restrictions. We wondered if Trump accurately assessed the resolution and its impact. We found that Trump was largely right about the resolution’s provisions, but experts cautioned that the true financial impact of the sanctions depend on future enforcement by member nations. We reached out to the White House but did not hear back. U.N. Resolution 2371 On Aug. 5, the 15 nations that make up the United Nations Security Council unanimously adopted Resolution 2371 (2017) to place new sanctions on North Korea. The resolution comes after North Korea’s most recent ballistic missile launches, in violation of a ban on nuclear and missile tests. The new U.N. resolution says: • North Korea shall not supply, sell or transfer coal, iron, iron ore, seafood, lead and lead ore to other countries; • UN Member States shall not increase the number of work permits for North Korean nationals (unless approved by the Security Council Committee), based on concerns that their earnings support North Korea’s nuclear and ballistic missile programs; • States shall prohibit the opening of new joint ventures or cooperative entities with North Korean entities and individuals, or the expansion of existing joint ventures through additional investments. The resolution also identified nine individuals and four entities that would become subject to a travel ban and asset freeze. The asset freeze extends to the Foreign Trade Bank, a state-owned bank that serves as North Korea’s primary foreign exchange bank. Provisions in the resolution could reduce North Korea’s revenue by about $1 billion, according to statements from delegates in the Security Council. The ban on exports from North Korea will prevent it from earning "over a $1 billion per year of hard currency that would be redirected to its illicit programs," said a resolution fact sheet from the U.S. Mission to the United Nations. The east Asian nation earns about $3 billion per year from export revenues, the fact sheet said. Trump’s tweet on the gravity of the sanctions echoes what Nikki Haley, the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, said after the resolution passed. "This resolution is the single largest economic sanctions package ever leveled against the North Korean regime," Haley said Aug. 5. "The price the North Korean leadership will pay for its continued nuclear and missile development will be the loss of one-third of its exports and hard currency. This is the most stringent set of sanctions on any country in a generation." The United Nations has passed multiple other resolutions against North Korea in condemnation of its ballistic missiles tests. A November 2016 resolution restricted exports of coal from North Korea and banned copper, nickel, silver, and zinc exports. That resolution estimated cuts of at least $800 million per year to North Korea’s revenues. Whether the Aug. 5 sanctions have the weight Trump and Haley professed depends on enforcement by other nations, experts told us. The latest sanctions "could be the biggest economic sanctions resolution imposed on North Korea, measured in the amount of hard currency provided to the regime — IF enforced," said Bonnie Glaser, a senior adviser for Asia and director of the China Power Project for Center for Strategic and International Studies. The claim that the United Nations sanctions would cost North Korea more than $1 billion is based on the assumption of "full and perfect" enforcement by all member states, said Benjamin Katzeff Silberstein, associate scholar at Foreign Policy Research Institute and co-editor of North Korean Economy Watch. "Judging by previous sanctions rounds (and sheer logic) this is virtually impossible and extremely unlikely because China tends to be lax in enforcement even of resolutions against North Korea that it votes in favor of," Katzeff Silberstein said. In a post for North Korean Economy Watch, Katzeff Silberstein noted that if a previous resolution had already been implemented in full, "North Korea’s export revenues would already have been badly hit." Our ruling Trump tweeted, "United Nations Resolution is the single largest economic sanctions package ever on North Korea. Over one billion dollars in cost to N.K." The United Nations Security Council on Aug. 5 passed a resolution to sanction North Korea in response to its ballistic missile tests. The resolution bans the country’s export of coal, iron, iron ore, seafood, lead and lead ore to other countries; freezes assets of certain entities and individuals; and prevents other nations from increasing the number of work permits to be issued to North Korean nationals. Overall, the sanctions could represent about $1 billion in costs to North Korea — but experts say that greatly depends on other nations’ full enforcement of the sanctions. Trump’s statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information. We rate it Mostly True.

pomt-05080	Says Dow Chemical decided to build a plant in Saudi Arabia rather than Oklahoma due to the impact of environmental regulations on the supply of natural gas.	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/jul/03/mitt-romney/mitt-romney-says-dow-chemical-chose-saudi-arabia-o/	Mitt Romney likes to draw a straight line between environmental regulations and the jobs they cost. That was the thrust of his statement at a Frankenmuth, Mich., campaign event on June 19, 2012. Romney said Oklahoma lost out on a plant that Dow Chemical ended up building in Saudi Arabia. Citing a conversation he'd had with a person from Dow, Romney told his audience at a business roundtable, "They said they couldn't rely on the natural gas here given the environmental regulation and whether it would be an abundant supply and reliable or not." We dug into the history and found the decision was actually made years ago. In 2007, Dow announced it had signed a memorandum of understanding with the oil giant Saudi Aramco to build a "world-scale chemicals and plastics production complex" in Saudi Arabia. This $20 billion joint venture would be the largest of its kind in the world. But Romney wasn’t highlighting a Dow project by itself. He was saying it could have happened in Oklahoma. We asked the Romney campaign to back up the claim that Dow had picked Saudi Arabia over Oklahoma for reasons related to the natural gas supply. We never heard back. We asked Dow if Oklahoma had ever been in the running as a possible location for that facility. The company never responded to that direct question. Instead, a spokesman released a statement that said Saudi Arabia was a good fit for the company’s goals of being able to serve growing markets, to develop new product lines and to operate in places where the costs give the company an advantage. On the subject of the natural gas supply, Dow said supply issues did matter in the days before natural gas from shale began flooding the market. Until then, "the climate for investment in the U.S. was increasingly challenging, resulting in decisions to preferentially invest in geographies with more stable, competitive energy and (natural gas) costs." The Dow statement went on to say that situation has changed. What it calls the "shale gale" has made the U.S. "a place where we can once again invest and grow." In April of this year, Dow announced it would build an ethylene production plant in Freeport, Texas, creating about 150 permanent jobs and about 2,000 construction jobs. That investment is part of a larger U.S. investment plan by the company in Texas and Louisiana that could add some 35,000 jobs nationwide. The company says this activity notwithstanding, the "need for regulatory reform remains critical." But still, nothing about Oklahoma. We searched the Dow Chemical website, reviewed the company’s past annual data books -- the ones it packages for investors -- and checked with a variety of trade publications for any mention of Oklahoma as a potential location for Dow’s future plants. No luck. We called the Oklahoma Department of Commerce. The deputy general counsel, Don Hackler, also drew a blank. "That doesn't sound familiar," Hackler said. "I don't remember it coming up." Hackler added that if Dow had been interested, his department would have likely heard, if for no other reason than the state offers incentives to companies who invest in Oklahoma. Al Greenwood who covers Dow for ICIS, an international news service for the petrochemical industry, said the assertion that Oklahoma was under serious consideration sounds like a stretch. "You don’t produce these compounds out of thin air," Greenwood said. "Dow needs feedstocks (of natural gas) and in the U.S., the feedstock hubs are in Texas and Louisiana. I don’t know why they would ever consider Oklahoma." Greenwood added that the Saudi Arabian investments put manufacturing closer to the boom markets of China and India and came with another important benefit -- ready access to propylene. Many of the products Dow wants to make in Saudi Arabia require a lot of propylene. Propylene is in short supply in the U.S. because it is most readily derived from oil, not natural gas. As is often noted, Saudi Arabia has plenty of oil. Oklahoma offers Dow no advantage in either market access or raw materials. Our ruling Mitt Romney said that a Dow official told him that the company opted to build a plant in Saudi Arabia rather than Oklahoma due to the state’s limited supply of natural gas thanks to environmental regulations. If that's case, no record of it appears to exist, Romney's campaign didn't offer any evidence to back it up and neither did Dow. We rate this claim False.

pomt-03345	Portland Bureau of Transportation "barely break(s) even" ticketing motorists.	half-true	/oregon/statements/2013/jul/20/portland-bureau-transportation-pbot/does-portland-break-even-enforcing-parking-regulat/	PolitiFact Oregon suspects there are stages a motorist experiences upon finding a yellow parking ticket envelope stuck to their windshield: Disbelief. Shame. Anger at those meanies at the city trying to squeeze every dime out of you, just to rack up revenue. Well, Dylan Rivera, a spokesman at the Portland Bureau of Transportation, told the Portland Mercury that "generally we barely break even" in parking enforcement. In other words, the city does not make revenue off errant motorists. A curious reader asked us to find out if that is true. Does revenue collected from parking fines cover the cost of enforcing parking rules? We sent an email to Rivera and to his colleague at PBOT communications, Diane Dulken. They confirmed what was stated in the Portland Mercury. "It’s a balancing act," said Dulken. "It’s not a cash cow; it’s not intended to raise revenue." Of course we asked for numbers to back up the claim. Here they are, in millions of dollars:: Year Revenue Expenses Direct Expenses Indirect Expenses 2009-10 $4.4 $5.5 $3.4 $2.1 2010-11 $5.1 $5.5 $3.4 $2.1 2011-12 $5.6 $7 $4.2 $2.8 2012-13 $6.6 $8.1 $4.8 $3.3 2013-14 $7.4 $8.7 $5.3 $3.4 You can see that expenses -- including both direct and indirect costs -- outstrip revenue collected. Direct costs are for salaries and equipment. Indirect costs are for overhead, such as phones, office space, public information officers and other administrative costs sprinkled throughout the bureau. The numbers for 2012-13, the budget year that ended June 30, are estimates. Dulken explained that the numbers increased because the city hired three new enforcement officers last year, bringing the total to 50. We also should remind readers that the city raised fines for some parking violations in February 2013. The projected numbers for this year exclude revenue and costs associated with a plan for new meters in Northwest Portland. If you count both indirect and direct expenses, PBOT isn’t breaking even. Instead, it appears the parking enforcement program has been losing money. (Why even enforce parking rules, you ask? Well, the city does get money from meters, and needs to maintain parking turnover for retailers. Plus, whom do you call when a stranger is blocking your private driveway? PBOT, apparently, is what stands between us and a disorderly parking free-for-all.) But here’s the deal. Like you, PolitiFact Oregon is highly suspicious. We don’t want to take a government employee’s word for it. We want to know how the budget for parking enforcement is presented to others. We pored through previous budgets, found online. We learned that the costs of parking enforcement in 2010-11 was $3.4 million; in 2011-12 it was $4.2 million; and in 2009-10 it was $3.4 million. In other words, the budgets use direct costs to convey the cost of the parking enforcement program. Indirect costs are not included. What’s up with that? We got on the phone with Rivera, who acknowledged that there are different ways to view costs. But the bottom line, he said, is that "our impression has been, and this inquiry has confirmed, that we’re not writing citations for the purpose of funding the transportation" bureau. Fair enough. We adore a reasonable and upfront response from government. Readers now have more information to assess how parking ticket money works in the city of Portland. There are different ways to look at the statement that ticket revenue matches costs. The city’s share of ticket revenue does not cover the fully loaded costs of providing enforcement services, according to the bureau. On the other hand, ticket revenue does cover the direct salary and equipment costs of writing tickets, according to public budgets. We’re not in a position to audit the bureau’s books. All we know is that indirect costs are not details readily available to the public. Direct costs are what the public can ferret out when assessing parking enforcement. To us, those are important details missing from a statement that can be accurate looked at one way, not accurate looked at another way. We rate the statement Half True.

One place where that is especially true is in Tennessee’s 6th Congressional District, where U.S. Rep. Diane Black, R-Gallatin, is embroiled in a Middle Tennessee slugfest with her GOP challenger, Lou Ann Zelenik. The race, a rematch from two years ago, is once again among the most closely watched political contests in the state. Both candidates oppose the health reforms. But Zelenik has not only questioned Black’s commitment to the cause, she and her aides have even suggested in campaign appearances, ads and news releases that Black has been deceptive about her record on health reform. "Diane Black voted to fund Obamacare, then she voted to repeal it. I guess she was for it before she was against it," Zelenik says in a radio ad. Zelenik’s campaign says the claim is based on Black’s votes on a series of short-term funding measures, known as "continuing resolutions," which keep the government running at current funding levels. Zelenik’s campaign manager, Jay Heine, noted that two other outspoken opponents of health-care reform -- U.S. Reps. Michele Bachmann, R-Minn., and Steve King, R-Iowa -- have voted against the continuing resolutions on the grounds that they would allow the health-care funding to continue. "We are criticizing our opponent for not joining them and voting against these bills," Heine said. By voting in favor of the resolutions, Black is allowing "the status quo" to happen and funding for the health reforms to continue, Heine said. "Our opinion," Heine said, "is that the status quo is not acceptable." Black’s campaign spokeswoman, Jennifer Baker, countered that the first-term congresswoman has voted numerous times to cut off funding for the health-care reforms. Baker provided us with a list of more than two dozen amendments and bills that Black has supported that would either repeal the health-reform law in its entirety, dismantle parts of it or block mandatory funding for the law. Black was not even in Congress when the House gave final approval to the health-reform bill in March 2010. Yet Zelenik is "leaving voters with the impression that Diane Black has actively voted to fund Obamacare," said Baker, who calls such a claim ridiculous. At the heart of the dispute is how the health-care law was funded. The law includes two kinds of budgetary provisions for the new entities created by or through the legislation, the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service noted in a report on July 18, 2012. The law bypassed the normal appropriations process and provided nearly $105 billion in mandatory funding, or "direct spending" as it’s known in budget parlance, over a number of years for some of the new programs. Put simply, that means money for the programs is included in the law and that it must be spent on those programs. Other provisions authorized appropriations for the new programs but did not provide the money directly. In these cases, funding must be provided through subsequent congressional votes during the annual appropriations process, when specific budgetary resources being provided are determined. That is how the appropriations process usually works. The $105 billion in mandatory funding is automatic and cannot be stopped unless Congress specifically votes to end it. King offered an amendment to do just that in February 2011, but the GOP-controlled House Rules Committee concluded the measure violated the rules for spending bills. The committee blocked the bill from receiving a vote on the House floor. Bachmann has since offered legislation to convert the mandatory spending to an authorization, which would allow Congress to stop it. Black is one of 96 cosponsors of that legislation, which has not yet received a vote on the House floor. Unlike Bachmann and King, Black did vote for series of short-term "continuing resolutions" to fund the government at existing levels. But is a vote in favor of the "continuing resolutions" really tantamount to voting to fund Obamacare? The resolutions are not a direct vote on the health-reform funding. In fact, we could find no mention of the health reforms anywhere in the resolutions. Norman Ornstein of the American Enterprise Institute watches Congress very closely and he said Zelenik’s claim is "not credible." "I find the charge absurd," he wrote in an email. "Voting to keep the government running -- which means keeping DOD (Department of Defense) in operation, keeping the Social Security checks coming, keeping the air traffic system operating, and so on -- is not tantamount to voting for health care. It is a huge stretch." Zelenik’s campaign insists that since the short-term "continuing resolutions" allow funding for all government programs, including those created and funded under the health-reform law, Black is guilty of failing to block funding. "Our standpoint is Congress has the ability to defund or fund anything – that is where the spending authority from the federal government originates from," Heine said. "Our standpoint is our opponent needs to take a stronger stance on this and work to defund it." PolitiFact has looked at claims that a vote for a state budget that included stimulus funding was tantamount to approving "Obama stimulus spending." One such recent claim in a Republican congressional primary in Florida resulted in a Pants On Fire! ruling for Congressman John Mica. Our ruling The public record shows Rep. Black has voted more than two dozen times to repeal President Obama’s health-care reforms and defund them. In claiming Black has actually voted to fund the health reforms, Zelenik and her aides point to Black’s votes on short-term spending measures that continue funding at current levels for all government programs. But was Black really very specifically "voting to fund Obamacare" or was she voting to keep the government from shutting down? Black has strongly opposed the health-care laws and Zelenik’s claim is a distortion designed to deliberately mislead voters about Black’s record. We find it False.

pomt-14769	In Texas, "we've had three ISIS-related incidents already."	half-true	/texas/statements/2015/dec/09/greg-abbott/abbotts-claims-isis-incidents-texas-three-facts-ke/	After the recent terrorist attacks in France, Texas Gov. Greg Abbott was among governors declaring they would not accept Syrian refugees because of a potential for terrorism. Abbott appeared on "The Real Story," a Fox News program, on Nov.17, 2015, to explain his stance on keeping refugees out of Texas because of security concerns. "We've had three ISIS-related incidents already and now with the possible connection of one of the Syrian refugees being involved in the terrorist attack in Paris," Abbott said, "Texas is saying 'no more.’ " We wondered whether Texas was really the site of so many ISIS plots. Abbott spokesman John Wittman pointed us to a letter from Abbott to Obama dated Nov. 16, 2015, which said: "The threat posed to Texas by ISIS is very real. ISIS claimed credit last May when two terrorist gunmen launched an attack in Garland, Texas. Less than two weeks later, the FBI arrested an Iraqi-born man in North Texas and charged him with lying to federal agents about traveling to Syria to fight with ISIS." The letter went on to say that "in 2014, when I served as Texas attorney general, we participated in a Joint Terrorism Task Force that arrested two Austin residents for providing material support to terrorists -- including ISIS." To determine if Abbott got his facts straight, we looked at each of the incidents. An Austin-area arrest and conviction Some of this was old ground for us. In September 2014, when Abbott was the state attorney general also running for governor, he claimed he’d been "involved in prosecuting a terrorist member of ISIS." We found that claim False; Abbott offered no evidence to back up his declaration aside from a press release crediting a range of agencies including the attorney general as well as the Killeen Police Department and Texas Alcoholic Beverage Commission. Abbott’s statement also relied on a broad definition of "terrorist" and "ISIS member." A federal complaint indicated Michael Todd Wolfe of Austin may have sought to be those things. But the complaint didn’t confirm he’d become a terrorist or ISIS member. In the case in question, Wolfe and Rahatul Khan of Round Rock, Texas, were charged with attempting to provide material support to terrorists. Wolfe had tried to board an international flight out of George Bush Intercontinental Airport that would take him to the first stop on a planned journey to Syria. In June 2015, Wolfe was sentenced to seven years in prison for attempting to provide material support to terrorists. According to the criminal complaint, Khan attempted to recruit an undercover FBI agent to a terrorist cell over the Internet. He was sentenced to 10 years imprisonment. The pipeline was affiliated with al-Shabaab — the al-Qaeda-linked Somali militant group behind the mass slaying of Christian students at a Kenyan university earlier this year—not ISIS. Abbott’s second described incident In his 2015 letter to Obama, Abbott also referenced concerns about Bilal Abood, the "Iraqi-born man in North Texas." Court documents show Abood migrated to the United States in 2009, and offer the following account of his subsequent movement and activities: On March 29, 2013, FBI agents prevented Abood from boarding a flight at Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport. He told them he was planning to visit family. Interviewed a second time five days later, Abood said his intent was to join the Free Syrian Army (FSA) in the struggle against Bashar al-Assad, the president of Syria. Later in April 2013, Abood travelled to Turkey via Mexico, "on or about" April 29. Agents again interviewed Abood upon his return to the United States on Sept. 16, 2013. He admitted he had travelled to Syria and stayed in an FSA camp, but denied financially supporting any terrorist group. A search of Abood’s computer in July 2014 found that he had tweeted a pledge of allegiance to Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, the leader of ISIS, on June 19, 2014. He later denied pledging allegiance to ISIS and was arrested for making "a materially false, fictitious and fraudulent statement and representation, in a matter within the jurisdiction of the Federal Bureau of Investigation." Abbott’s letter mischaracterizes the nature of Abood’s offense; he wrote that Abood was charged with "lying to federal agents about traveling to Syria to fight with ISIS," not lying about a tweet. Shootings in Garland The third incident referenced by Abbott was the Garland, Texas, shooting scheme attempted by Elton Simpson and Nadir Soofi on May 5, 2015. According to a criminal complaint the FBI later filed against a Florida man who claimed to have encouraged the attack, the two planned to shoot attendees at a contest centered around cartoons of the prophet Muhammad (drawing the prophet Muhammad is forbidden in Islam). However, they were shot and killed outside the event by police. This incident is the only foiled attack included in a Department Homeland Security analysis of all ISIS-related arrests on United States soil from January 2014 to September 2015 (the other cases were unsuccessful and successful attempts to travel to fight with ISIS, provide material support to ISIS, and engage in early stage "aspirational" attack planning). In the aftermath of the shooting, ISIS claimed credit. However, by the time Abbott made his claim, investigators had yet to issue any statement characterizing the Garland attack as having been ordered by members of ISIS. Simpson was involved in terrorist causes before ISIS even split off from Al-Qaeda. He was arrested by the FBI in 2010 after discussing jihad and potential travel to Somalia with an informant the previous year. Allison Mahan, an FBI spokeswoman in Dallas, told us via email, "The Garland attackers were ISIS-inspired and the investigation is ongoing." ISIS-inspired terrorist attacks are much more common than attacks directly ordered by members of the group, according to an analysis published in the October 2015 issue of the Terrorism Research Initiative’s Perspectives on Terrorism. The TRI is an international consortium of scholars founded in 2007 to facilitate security studies research. Our ruling In his opposition to resettlement of Syrian refugees in Texas, Gov. Greg Abbott said he was concerned about potential terrorism from devotees to the Islamic State. In Texas, Abbott said, "we've had three ISIS-related incidents already." Abbott is on solid ground with one Islamic State-related incident — the Garland shooting plot. In other Texas arrests related to the group, he uses the term "incident" to cover things including lying about a tweet and trying to travel to Syria. We rate this statement Half True. HALF TRUE – The statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of context. Click here for more on the six PolitiFact ratings and how we select facts to check.

pomt-02773	"The most popular name is no longer John or Steven. It's Jose, Camilo and Maria."	mostly false	/punditfact/statements/2013/dec/09/jorge-ramos/univisions-ramos-names-jose-camilo-and-maria-are-m/	Sandwiched between jokes on the Dec. 5, 2013, episode of the Daily Show, Univision anchor Jorge Ramos offered a factual claim that even had Daily Show host Jon Stewart asking, "Really?" Ramos was documenting the growth of the Hispanic population in the United States. Hispanics are the country’s largest ethnic minority group at 53 million people, and by 2060, the Hispanic population is expected to reach nearly 130 million. That would equal about a third of all Americans. Already, there are signs of a shift, Ramos said. "The most popular name is no longer John or Steven," Ramos told Stewart. "It's Jose, Camilo and Maria." Like Stewart, we wondered if Ramos’ claim was correct. We got in touch with Ramos, and he clarified that when he talked about names, he had states like California and Texas in mind, not so much the entire United States. And he thought he was talking about which names were more popular (as a comparison), not the most popular overall. The ultimate source on baby names is the Social Security Administration, which conveniently provides a database that allows you to slice and dice the information by year, state and name. We found that in certain states, Ramos is partly right. In the five states with the highest portion of Hispanic residents, Jose is more popular than both John and Steven. We looked at other states that have some of the largest numbers of Hispanics and found that there is a break point. When the Hispanic population is above 27 percent of the total, Jose outranks John. Below that line, John is more popular. State % Hispanic population Jose - rank among baby names John - rank among baby names New Mexico 46.7 28 56 California 38.1 25 55 Texas 38.1 6 36 Arizona 30.1 28 53 Nevada 27.1 41 57 Florida 22.8 73 39 Colorado 20.9 89 38 New Jersey 18.1 91 20 New York 18 100 26 Illinois 16.1 76 26 United States 17 72 28 Source: Social Security Administration So Ramos has a point when it comes to Jose and even more so for Steven, which fails to make the top 100 in Texas, Arizona and New Mexico. Ramos’ batting average falls for the rest of the names he gave. Camilo barely ranks in the top 1,000 nationwide. Maria is more popular but never does better than its rank of 58 in Texas. We should give a nod to the creativity or maybe just the flexibility of American parents. Since 2000, the popularity has fallen for every name Ramos mentioned, except Camilo. Nationally, Jose fell from 34 to 72, John went from 14 to 28, Steven dropped from 54 to 112, and Maria from 41 to 101. Camilo only shows up in the top 1,000 starting in 2009 and its rank moved from 901 to 837. If you were wondering, the most popular names in 2012: Jacob and Sophia. Our ruling Ramos said that the most popular names are no longer John or Steven, but Jose, Camilo and Maria. Afterward, Ramos said he was thinking of states with large Hispanic populations. With that caveat, he has a bit of a point. In states with the highest percentage of Hispanics, Jose beats out John and Steven. Camilo and Maria are not really contenders. None of these names are the most popular in any state. We rate the claim Mostly False.	None	Jorge Ramos	None	None	None	2013-12-09T13:59:51	2013-12-05	['None']
pomt-05360	Says "Schaufler was the only Democrat who voted to stop" the state’s health care reform plan.	mostly false	/oregon/statements/2012/may/10/oregon-league-conservation-voters/was-rep-mike-schaufler-really-only-dem-vote-agains/	Rep. Mike Schaufler is facing a tough primary challenge in his re-election bid for House District 48. Much of the criticism being lobbed his way paints him as a Democrat in name only, one who has a tendency to side with Republicans on high-profile issues. One particularly damning mailer comes from the Oregon League of Conservation Voters. Schaufler’s face is shown alongside former vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin’s. "Mike Schaufler Stands with Tea Party Republicans," the mailer reads. What was the mailer’s basis for tying Schaufler to Republicans? A vote he took on health care legislation during the February 2012 session. "When a bill to implement Governor Kitzhaber and President Obama’s health care reform plan came up for a vote in Oregon, Schaufler was the only Democrat who voted to stop it." February wasn’t that long ago -- and this particular vote stood out pretty clearly in our minds. We thought we ought to take a look at just how accurate the accusation is. The mailer cites its source -- "Check the Facts" -- as an article from The Oregonian headlined "A Democrat defects in the Oregon House, stalls insurance bill." The story is easily found online. Here’s how reporter Harry Esteve describes the day’s events: "An Oregon House Democrat broke ranks Monday and helped Republicans stall a key health insurance bill, throwing into question the delicate balance of power at the Legislature. "Rep. Mike Schaufler, of Happy Valley, provided the sole Democratic vote that sent a bill setting up health insurance exchanges back to committee and to an uncertain future." Explaining his vote to stall the bill, Schaufler said, "We need to create jobs. We shouldn't do anything this session until we do that." He also pointed out, the story said, that "he has been making almost daily speeches on the House floor about the need to free up timber and water for job creation, and said no one should be surprised by his action Monday." Now, this all went down on Feb. 13. Let’s fast-forward a few weeks to March 2, when the bill managed to get back to the floor for a final vote. That day, Schaufler (and, it should be noted, 25 Republicans) voted with every single Democratic House member to pass the legislation. The Senate followed suit three days later and the legislation became law. We called the Oregon League of Conservation Voters to see what they had to say about this second vote. Doug Moore, the executive director, said the second vote had nothing to do with the mailer. "We’re talking about a specific vote," he said. "We cite that specific vote." But what of the overall impression that he voted to kill the bill? "We didn’t say he voted against it. We didn’t say he voted to kill it. We said he voted to stop it," Moore argued. "Campaign communications are about talking to voters and there’s not an obligation to tell both sides of the story when sending out mail pieces." Yes, but that both-sides-of-the-story issue can be relevant in determining what’s true and determining truth is why we at PolitiFact Oregon have jobs. We agree that Schaufler certainly voted to stall the bill initially -- and he ticked off a lot of his fellow Democrats in doing so. But he didn’t vote to kill it, which the ad implies -- even if it uses the word "stop." Whether Schaufler’s actions were justified, we can’t say, but it seems pretty obvious to us that he stalled the bill to get action on other bills and not for reasons pertaining to the legislation itself. What’s more, Schaufler ultimately gave his blessing to the bill. In truth, it didn’t face much partisan opposition at all. It passed just five votes shy of a unanimous endorsement. The Oregon League of Conservation Voters is trying to make Schaufler seem out of touch with his Democratic base. That’s not our call. We’re concerned with whether he was really "the only Democrat who voted to stop" the health care legislation. Yes, he voted to stall the legislation. The statement has an element of truth. But it ignores critical facts that would give a different impression, namely that in the end he voted to pass it. That’s why we rate this claim Mostly False.

pomt-12423	"More (people) die from indoor air pollution than from malaria, HIV/AIDS and TB combined."	mostly true	/global-news/statements/2017/may/18/james-rockall/yes-indoor-air-pollution-kills-more-hivaids-malari/	Emphasizing the need to bring clean fuel to the world’s poor, James Rockall, CEO of the World LPG Association, recently said that "more (people) die of indoor air pollution than malaria, HIV/AIDS and tuberculosis combined." Rockall’s statement showed up in a tweet from Stanford Energy, a research group at Stanford University, after he spoke there May 9. Rockall confirmed that he did make this claim, and we decided to check it out. Public health researchers have known for some time that in many poorer nations, fumes from dirty cooking stoves pose a health threat. Rockall’s group represents the interests of the liquified petroleum gas industry, but that self-interest aside, there’s no question that gas burns more cleanly than wood or coal. Rockall told us he got his numbers from the World Health Organization. He took a 2016 report on deaths from indoor air pollution and compared that to 2015 estimates of death from HIV/AIDS, malaria and tuberculosis. The indoor air pollution deaths, however, were based on 2012 data. To keep the comparison fair, we looked at 2012 mortality estimates for HIV/AIDS, malaria and tuberculosis. We consulted three different sources -- UNAIDS, WHO and the Global Burden of Disease Study -- and used the highest available estimate. Here’s what the numbers show: Deaths in 2012 HIV/AIDS 1.6 million Malaria 0.8 million TB 1.3 million Total 3.7 million Indoor air pollution total 4.2 million As you can see, the total mortality from the three diseases comes to 3.7 million in 2012, less than the 4.2 million people estimated to have died from diseases attributable to indoor air pollution. Rockall used different underlying estimates to reach a total of 2.9 million deaths due to the three diseases. Our total is higher, but we found no estimates from any source that undercut his basic point. Deaths from indoor air pollution are higher than the sum of deaths from the world’s major leading infectious diseases. A note of caution Counting deaths from indoor air pollution is more complicated than tracking deaths from HIV/AIDS, malaria and tuberculosis. Mark Wilson, professor of epidemiology at the University of Michigan, said it is easier to identify someone who has HIV/AIDS, malaria and tuberculosis. "Much more difficult is defining how one dies from indoor air pollution because it will never be the sole immediate cause of death," Wilson said. "Rather, a variety of physiological, immunological and toxicological processes would compromise someone’s health, such that the cause might be defined as some sort of respiratory insufficiency, asthma, heart disease, etcetera." The WHO study made various assumptions to link diseases such as lung cancer, pneumonia, stroke, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and ischemic heart disease to indoor air pollution. Our ruling Rockall said more people die of indoor air pollution than HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria combined. We compared 2012 estimates of indoor air pollution deaths to a range of estimates for the three infectious diseases for 2012 and later. No matter how we did it, the deaths due to indoor air pollution trumped those due to HIV/AIDS, malaria and tuberculosis combined. But an epidemiologist offered the caveat that the indoor air pollution study relied on assumptions that introduce a greater chance of uncertainty than counts of deaths from the leading infectious diseases. For that reason, we rate this statement Mostly True. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com	None	James Rockall	None	None	None	2017-05-18T15:41:04	2017-05-09	['HIV/AIDS']
pomt-07084	In the Republican presidential debate in New Hampshire, none of the candidates mentioned the "middle class" or "education."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/jun/24/jay-carney/democrats-say-republican-presidential-candidates-d/	To illustrate that the Republican presidential candidates are out of touch with ordinary Americans, White House Press Secretary Jay Carney cited two things that he said the candidates failed to mention during a two-hour CNN debate from New Hampshire: education and the middle class. Flying to Puerto Rico on Air Force One on June 14, 2011, Carney told reporters: "I was struck by the fact that over the course of two hours, the phrase ‘middle class’ and the word ‘education’ did not pass anyone’s lips that I heard, which was striking to me because the middle class is obviously, to our mind, the primary focus of everything that we do in terms of the economic policies we pursue and the concerns we have. The middle class not only suffered tremendously during the great recession and is suffering as we emerge from it, but was under a great deal of pressure even prior to the recession. While incomes were growing rapidly under the previous administration and the economy was expanding, middle-class incomes were flat, stagnant, and even dropping. So that was one observation. "And another is that . . . as the president talks about a lot, education could be the key, the defining element of whether or not the United States of America can compete globally in the 21st century -- compete and win. We think it’s a high, high priority. And I was struck by the absence of attention to that very key issue last night." Carney's comment was a Democratic talking point on the day after the debate. The Democratic National Committee issued a Web video called "What in the world are they talking about?" that made the same point. So were Carney and the DNC right? We checked the debate transcript and found that Carney is technically correct that the words "middle class" and "education" did not appear in the 21,798-word debate. But it's important to look more broadly and see whether the candidates used other words with the same meaning. And indeed, we found the candidates made several references to middle-income Americans — they just used different words: ● Former Minnesota governor Tim Pawlenty referred to America’s "middle-income and modest-income people" when WMUR political reporter Josh McElveen questioned him on his plan to "right the housing ship." "Well, the first thing we need to do is get the government out of crony capitalism," Pawlenty said. "We have this alliance between big government, big unions and certain big bailout businesses. And as Congressman Paul said a few minutes ago, we had politicians in Congress trying to micromanage the housing market, and they created a bubble and they created the mess. And now we have all these innocent bystanders, the good people of the United States of America, many middle-income and modest-income people, who've been devastated by this." ● Pawlenty also mentioned "blue-collar communities" as he cited his upbringing in a "meat packing" and "manufacturing" town with a father who worked as a "Teamster truck driver" for much of his life. Speaking about a plan to return manufacturing jobs to the U.S., Pawlenty said, "I understand what it's like to see the blue-collar communities and the struggles that they've had when manufacturing leaves. So I've seen that firsthand. But No. 1, we've got to have fair trade, and what's going on right now is not fair." ● We counted three references to the middle class by former U.S. Sen. Rick Santorum of Pennsylvania, who spoke of the "broad middle of America." "I always am from Pennsylvania," Santorum said. "We still make things there, and I represented the Steel Valley of Pittsburgh when I was in the Congress. And what I learned from growing up in Butler, Pa., steel town is that the broad middle of America was a broad middle of America when we had lots of manufacturing here because that's how the wealth from those who create the jobs get down. … We want to encourage people to set up jobs here in America. Take that R&D credit, make it permanent, take that innovation and then invest that money here to create that broad middle of America and have that wealth really trickle down." On education, however, Carney was correct. We couldn't find any reference to the subject during the debate. Still, it's important to note that the candidates didn't choose the topics for questions. That was done by CNN host John King, New Hampshire journalists and voters. They chose not to ask about education. In fact, King started the debate reminding candidates of the rules, saying, "We've also asked the candidates to answer the questions that they're asked, rather than the question they might have wished to be asked." Our ruling Carney was technically correct that education and the middle class were not mentioned in the debate. But several times candidates made references to middle-income people using other terms. And they never got asked about education. We rate the claim Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.	None	Jay Carney	None	None	None	2011-06-24T15:03:26	2011-06-14	['Republican_Party_(United_States)']
pomt-07481	"By the end of this decade, the interest we owe on our debt could rise to nearly $1 trillion."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/apr/14/barack-obama/barack-obama-says-us-interest-load-will-hit-nearly/	During his April 13, 2011, speech on his vision for America’s fiscal future, President Barack Obama offered a striking statistic about the future burden of interest on the national debt. "Even after our economy recovers," Obama said, "our government will still be on track to spend more money than it takes in throughout this decade and beyond. That means we’ll have to keep borrowing more from countries like China. And that means more of your tax dollars will go toward paying off the interest on all the loans we keep taking out. By the end of this decade, the interest we owe on our debt could rise to nearly $1 trillion. Just the interest payments." We thought we’d check whether Obama was correct that "by the end of this decade, the interest we owe on our debt could rise to nearly $1 trillion." We turned to figures published by the Congressional Budget Office, Congress’ nonpartisan arbiter of fiscal statistics and projections. Specifically, we looked at CBO’s analysis, published in March, of Obama’s fiscal year 2012 budget proposal. In that report, CBO offered two different projections for what the interest burden would be by the end of the decade. One of the projections looks at what would happen under Obama’s proposal. The other projection is known as the "baseline" budget. The baseline budget estimates what needs to be spent to maintain current services. It includes the effects of inflation, and it assumes that current law will continue indefinitely. Baselines can be a useful measure, but they are not perfect. Adhering to current law requires the assumption that Congress will let a number of policies expire, including the Bush tax cuts, periodic adjustments to limit the impact of the Alternative Minimum Tax and delays to scheduled Medicare reimbursement cuts to physicians. There’s no certainty that Congress and the president will follow through with these phase-outs, given the political support for them, so the baseline budget likely underestimates the size of future deficits. Despite such imperfections, we thought that both scenarios were relevant for judging the president’s statement, so we’ll offer the figures for both. We’ll also offer figures for both 2019 and 2020, since we couldn’t come up with an answer to the question of what year constitutes the "end of this decade." Let’s look first at the president’s budget proposal. CBO says that during 2019, net interest costs will reach $794 billion. By 2020, the number reaches $866 billion. Now, we’ll look at the baseline budget. CBO says that during 2019, net interest costs will reach $710 billion. By 2020, the number reaches $762 billion. None of these four estimates reaches $1 trillion. The closest number is off by 13 percent, and the lowest is off by 29 percent. Marc Goldwein, policy director for the centrist Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, said the president is not far off, especially given the high degree of uncertainty about what the law will be a decade from now. Other experts we spoke to said the White House had to stretch to reach the flashy $1 trillion figure. Daniel Mitchell, a senior fellow with the libertarian Cato Institute, said that "$710 billion or $762 billion is a lot of money, but it's not ‘nearly $1 trillion.’" The White House pointed us to a third possibility -- the interest burden in 2021. Why 2021? That’s the final year of the decadelong "budget window." CBO estimated interest in 2021 to be $931 billion -- closer to $1 trillion than any of our other numbers, and possibly enough to justify Obama’s wording of "nearly $1 trillion." Still, we think most listeners wouldn’t immediately assume the president is talking about budget windows when he says "by the end of this decade." Using the figures for 2019 or 2020 instead, Obama’s numbers are off by anywhere from 13 percent to 29 percent. Obama’s underlying point is still sound -- the United States will have hundreds of billions of dollars of debt on the books -- but we think the most obvious numbers fall short of "nearly $1 trillion." On balance, we rate the statement Half True.	None	Barack Obama	None	None	None	2011-04-14T15:56:46	2011-04-13	['None']
pomt-03021	Bill Gunter would "drain millions from local public schools, and give our tax dollars to private, for-profit schools run by out-of-state corporations."	mostly false	/florida/statements/2013/oct/12/florida-democratic-party/campaign-mailer-says-bill-gunter-would-cut-funding/	The race to succeed Mike Fasano in the state House is producing a glut of attack ads, including two recent mailers that stand out. One claims that Democrat Amanda Murphy is out of touch with average voters and wouldn't be available, literally, because she'll be at her "Cancun vacation home." The other says Republican Bill Gunter would "drain millions" from public education and give the money to for-profit schools. With the House District 36 election set for Oct. 15, 2013, PolitiFact Florida decided to test the accuracy of these noteworthy mailers. Here, we'll examine the ad targeting Gunter's view on public education, which showed up in mailboxes a couple weeks ago. (We'll look at the attack against Murphy in a separate fact-check.) "Gunter would drain millions from local public schools, and give our tax dollars to private, for-profit schools run by out-of-state corporations," the ad says. The Florida Democratic Party financed the mailer. It cites aTimes article, a preview of the Republican primary, published Sept. 13. In the story, three Republicans seeking the nomination weighed in on whether funding to public schools should be increased. Gunter said he opposed increased state funding for education and suggested the private sector play a larger role, a statement he alluded to at least twice before: at a Sept. 4 candidates debate and in a questionnaire, where he stated: "Money isn't the issue. . . . Highest per pupil spending districts are some of the worst in the nation." None of his statements referenced "for-profit schools run by out-of-state corporations." Joshua Karp, spokesman for the Florida Democratic Party, said freezing educational spending at its present level would result in cuts to Pasco schools to offset rising expenses. Also, diverting state funding to the private sector, or charter schools, takes away money from public schools, he said. Olga Swinson, chief financial officer for Pasco schools and the past president of Florida School Finance Officers Association, said a state funding freeze might result in budget cuts if costs for salaries, pensions, insurance, utilities, maintenance and other services go up at the same time. Many of those costs have indeed increased in recent years, leading to cuts. "With every fund that we have, we would have to make do or we would have to start cutting programs," she said. Whether those cuts would amount to "draining millions" from the district is debatable, but Swinson wouldn't rule out the possibility and explained that the depth of cuts would depend on how much insurance, maintenance, pensions and other costs increase. Enrollment levels and local revenue streams would influence spending as well. Additionally, there's little evidence to the Democrats' claim that earmarking state funds to charter schools would enrich "for-profit schools run by out-of-state corporations." Most of the seven charter schools operating in Pasco are locally owned. The Imagine Charter School of Land O'Lakes is owned by a Virginia-based company. The ad makes broad assumptions that district costs would swell by millions of dollars, leading to cuts, that local revenues wouldn't keep pace and that charter schools owned by out-of-state companies would get tax money. That's a lot of assuming. Still, history shows that education costs are consistently on the rise. We rate the claim Mostly False.

pomt-02155	Says gubernatorial candidate Clay Pell "hasn't spent a dime on advertising."	pants on fire!	/rhode-island/statements/2014/may/02/robert-walsh/neari-executive-director-robert-walsh-jr-says-cand/	During an April 20, 2014, interview on WPRI-TV's "Newsmakers," Robert A. Walsh Jr., executive director of the National Education Association-Rhode Island, was asked about the likelihood that Clay Pell would win September's Democratic primary and, ultimately, the November election. Walsh downplayed the importance of the latest polls showing little support among Democrats for Pell, the gubernatorial candidate supported by the union. (Pell was favored by 9.4 percent in an April 11 Brown University poll and 15 percent in a February Providence Journal / WPRI survey.) "Poll numbers in April for a relatively new candidate are meaningless," Walsh said. "What is he? Mid-teens or something right now? But he hasn't spent a dime on advertising or done anything else. He's getting out there meeting people. When he meets people he converts them to his cause and his message." Hasn't spent a dime on advertising? That didn't make cents to us. Immediately after Pell's announcement on Jan. 28, 2014, it was almost impossible to go online and not see ads for Pell popping up on nearly every website you’d visit -- even those featuring General Treasurer Gina Raimondo, one of Pell’s Democratic opponents. Those ads cost a lot of dimes, so we called Walsh to see if he could justify his claim. He responded by email: "Of course the reference was to the traditional television buys that accompany campaigns (since I was on TV when I mentioned it)," he wrote. That's not a distinction he made during the program. Exactly how much has Pell spent on advertising? On April 23 we began an effort to get that information -- even a rough estimate. Pell's campaign promised to get back to us, but despite repeated follow-up calls and emails, we couldn't get our questions answered. A week later, on April 30, the Pell campaign, as required by law, filed its quarterly finance report for the first three months of 2014. It showed that Pell, who began his campaign by loaning himself a million dollars, has now invested another million dollars of his own money in his campaign and spent $311,547 in January, February and March. It also showed that on Jan. 7, Pell spent $36,530 on advertising and media production through a media company in Washington, D.C. The firm got another $7,880 on March 10. (The other two items listed as advertising expenditures were $200 for an ad with the Rhode Island Black Heritage Society and $800 for a full-page ad in the program book of this year's Providence Newspaper Guild Follies, run by unionized workers at The Journal.) Our ruling NEARI executive director Robert Walsh said candidate Clay Pell "hasn't spent a dime on advertising." At the time, the Pell campaign had already spent 444,100 dimes, or $44,410, on advertising through a Washington media firm. We know the public has seen at least some of that money because we were inundated with online Pell ads soon after his announcement. To suggest that Pell hasn't spent a dime -- or a quarter, or a dollar -- on advertising is not only short-changing the truth, it's ridiculous. We rate it Pants on Fire!

pomt-07482	Says "Congressman Eric Cantor wants to eliminate Social Security."	pants on fire!	/virginia/statements/2011/apr/14/campaign-americas-future/liberal-groups-say-eric-cantor-wants-eliminate-soc/	A new television ad taking aim at U.S. Rep. Eric Cantor’s position on Social Security gives us a sense of deja vu. The Campaign for America’s Future, a liberal advocacy group, has aired the television ad this month in Cantor’s 7th District saying the congressman is a threat to the retirement dreams of Americans younger than 55. "Congressman Eric Cantor wants to eliminate Social Security," the narrator intones in the 31-second spot, based on a comment the majority leader made in a March 21 appearance before the conservative Hoover Institution. The ad supports the claim with an audio snippet of Cantor’s response to a question from the audience. Speaking about entitlement programs such as Social Security, Cantor said it’s important to protect benefits for those 55 and older. "But for the rest of us, listen, we’re going to have to come to grips with the fact that these programs cannot exist if we want America to be what we want America to be," Cantor said. In recent weeks, scads of liberal politicians, organizations and bloggers have been pouncing on the same statement to argue it’s evidence the GOP is showing its true intentions to end Social Security. One of groups, Americans United for Change, used the comment to argue Cantor wanted to eliminate Social Security and Medicare. In an April 1 Truth-O-Meter, PolitiFact national rated that claim False, pointing out that in other public appearances Cantor has called for changing, not abolishing entitlement programs like Social Security. Seconds after making the Hoover statement that sparked the frenzy, Cantor added: "We’re going to have to accept some changes as far as the rest of us, and what we’re saying is for those 55 and older (they) do not have to worry about changes in benefits, but for the rest of us we will," Cantor said. There are other statements showing Cantor envisions a future with Social Security: *In a Feb. 19 op-ed in Politico, he said the country’s entitlement programs "will not be available for our children unless they are modernized and reformed." *In a March 16 interview with CNBC, he said, "If you look at these entitlement programs, what we’ve got to admit to ourselves is they’re not going to be around in their current state unless we significantly alter who we are as a country." He said that for workers 54 and younger, Republicans were going to insist on dealing "with the fact that if these programs are going to be around, they’re going to have to look a lot different." *In the April 13 Richmond Times-Dispatch, Cantor again said if programs like Social Security are to remain viable, they must change for those under 55. "We want them to be around because we care about those who need our help," Cantor said. "We want a safety net in place that actually is there for people who need it, not for those who don’t." Robert L. Borosage, the co-director of the Campaign for America’s Future, sent us an email insisting Cantor does want to end Social Security and saying his comment at Hoover isn’t the only proof. Borosage sent us a link to a portion of an April 10 appearance Cantor made on Fox News Sunday. While talking about the Republican 2012 budget plan and entitlements, Cantor said "I know those programs are not going to be there for me when I retire, just like everyone else 54 and younger. They can’t. We can’t sustain that kind of trajectory." But a review of the full interview on Fox showed that as Cantor talked about the House GOP 2012 budget, he also said Republicans are "talking about changing the way that the entitlements work in this country for the future while protecting today’s seniors." Cantor has been short on specifics about how he would reform Social Security. Let’s recap: The Campaign for America’s Future used part of a comment Cantor made at the Hoover Institution to argue the congressman wants to eliminate Social Security for those under 55.. But Cantor had a made a number of statements, previous to the ad, which show that is not his position. The Majority Leader has said the program must be changed to remain viable, not eliminated, even though he has been short on specifics about how he would reform Social Security. It would have been easy for the Campaign for America’s Future to find those statements before they ran the ad. Instead, they cherry-picked a Cantor comment and gave it no context. We rate their statement Pants on Fire.	None	Campaign for America's Future	None	None	None	2011-04-14T11:04:04	2011-04-08	['Eric_Cantor']
pomt-00564	The film and TV industry supports more than 24,000 direct jobs and pays local workers more than $1.68 billion in wages in Georgia.	mostly true	/georgia/statements/2015/jun/12/motion-picture-association-america/federal-data-backs-claim-about-movie-and-tv-jobs/	Georgia’s lucrative tax credits for movie and TV production generate more than just the chance to spot Betty White and Chris Evans noshing in restaurants around Atlanta. The industry also supports more than 24,000 jobs and pays more than $1.68 billion in wages to those workers, according to a press release this week from the Motion Picture Association of America. That’s the equivalent of the entire population of the city of Decatur working in an industry that in 2013 saw $261 million spent on location in shoots in Georgia, according to a 2013 report from a nonprofit that tracks English-language film production worldwide. So, PolitiFact Georgia thought those numbers seemed high but plausible – especially if you count the hordes of zombies needed every week in "The Walking Dead." We decided to check it out. First, it’s worth knowing that the MPAA released its data for Georgia and other states as part of a hard push of Trade Promotion Authority (TPA), in which Congress defines negotiating priorities for trade agreements. In this case, the Senate has approved but the House has yet to vote on providing "fast track" authority for President Obama to speed a Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal (TPP) through Congress. In other words, the deal would expand trade and access for Atlanta’s zombies – not to mention "The Hunger Games" franchise and the Evans’ now-filming "Captain America: Civil War" – to much of the Asia-Pacific region, said MPAA spokeswoman Kate Bedingfield. "The movies made in Georgia are reaching a global audience, and it’s important we can access those markets with as little friction as possible," Bedingfield said. "The jobs grown in Georgia are dependent on being able to market those products easily overseas." Georgia has heavily incentivized the industry in recent years to lure projects. Production companies can earn a 20 percent income tax credit on in-state costs of projects worth at least $500,000. Another 10 percent credit is given for using a Georgia logo in production credits. The MPAA used the federal government’s own data, compiled by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics in the Quarterly Census of Employment and Wages, in calculating the total job and wage estimates. The BLS data broad categories of motion pictures and broadcasting show an annual average of 20,869 employees and total annual wages of $1.55 billion in 2013. But the MPAA drills down deeper into those broad categories and others, excluding the recording artists covered in the broad category but captures jobs from other categories – such as payroll workers and electricians – it can show work in the film or TV industry, said Julia Jenks, the vice president of research for the MPAA. In some of those more specific groups, such as cable TV production, all of the jobs and pay count toward the MPAA tally. Others, such as costume rental and wardrobe, are counted based on U.S. Census or research calculations that tell what proportion of those jobs work in the industry. The MPAA calls that its adjustment factor on the government figures. "It’s our best estimate, and a very conservative estimate," Jenks said. Using those parameters, the BLS counts 48,539 jobs but the MPAA tally for Georgia is 24,162: Job Code Description BLS total Adjustment MPAA total 334614 Audio/Video Reproduction 152 68.7% 104 512110 Motion Picture Video & Production 3,864 100% 3,864 512120 Motion Picture & Video Distribution 22 100% 22 512191 Teleproduction, Other Post Production 148 42% 62 512199 Other Motion Picture & Video 59 100% 59 532220 Formal Wear/Costume Rental 623 3% 19 532490 Other Machinery Rental, Leasing 1,349 6% 81 541214 Payroll 15,739 30% 4,722 561311 Employment Placement 6,198 1% 62 711510 Independent artists, writers 1,291 23% 297 423990 Prerecorded Video Wholesale 1,738 12% 209 512131 Movie Theaters (except drive-ins) 3,348 100% 3,348 512132 Drive-in Theaters 45 100% 45 515120 Television Broadcasting 7,138 100% 7,138 515210 Cable & Subscription Programming 3,670 100% 3,670 519130 Internet Publishing & Broadcasting 2,778 3% 83 532230 Video & Disk Rental 377 100% 377 Using the BLS tables, PolitiFact Georgia was able to replicate all of the job figures, except in three categories. The 2013 quarterly census shows 303 jobs in audio/video reproduction – exactly double the MPAA’s count. And, the official BLS data does not have an annual average for jobs in the one category few think of as a movie industry gig: working in movie and drive-in theaters, economist Timothy Ewing said. A nine-month average is available for those jobs, which have high turnover. But that means they are comparable to the yearly figures in other categories. Ewing could not comment on the adjustments the MPAA made in categories, other than to note it would create more conservative estimates. So, using the BLS-confirmed data, and the MPAA’s own adjustments, the total number of jobs drops to 20,873. But the MPAA is conservative in other ways. It does not include at all freelance workers common in production, who provide contract work in, say, makeup or construction. PolitiFact Georgia recently showed that Tyler Perry’s new studio planned for Fort McPherson will alone create between 2,000 to 6,000 of those jobs. It is reasonable to think the MPAA could easily reach its 24,000 jobs figure if it counted contract work on the 23 movies or 39 TV series filmed in Georgia in 2013. The question remains if those jobs, and their pay, are truly Georgia jobs. The state incentive allows movie companies to get credits on what they pay stars, and accountants, for the time they work in the state. Our ruling The MPAA released data this week to bolster its lobbying to fast-track a trade deal that would open more of Asia to its content. It claimed the industry supported 24,000 direct jobs and paid workers more than $1.68 billion in the Peach State in 2013. Federal data confirms nearly all of the job figures and payroll, many of which have been reduced from the official headcount. The MPAA overreaches in deciding movie theater workers such as ushers are industry workers, versus retail employees. But those jobs would likely be outweighed by freelance workers on production sets, which the MPAA did not count in its tally. We rate the group’s claim Mostly True.

pomt-09713	"One-third of the health care dollar goes to no such thing as health care; it goes to the insurance companies."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/oct/30/patrick-kennedy/insurance-companies-national-health-spending/	Rep. Patrick Kennedy gave a strong defense of Democratic plans for health reform on the House floor, attacking Republican opponents as defenders of insurance companies. "The other side talks about the health care reform bill costing a lot of money," Kennedy said. "Right now, consumers in America are spending millions and millions of dollars paying that to the insurance companies. One-third of the health care dollar goes to no such thing as health care; it goes to the insurance companies. That's why the Democratic proposal restricts the amount of money that insurance companies can spend on bureaucracy." The idea that insurance companies get a third of all health spending in the country struck us as suspicious. And sure enough, our research showed that Kennedy was mixing up his statistics. To start with, every health insurance company is different, and there are different ways to count administrative expenses. Generally speaking, the most efficient insurers cover large groups of employees, while the least efficient sell policies to individuals. Nevertheless, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, a federal agency, publishes national health expenditure data, which include a breakdown of "The Nation's Health Dollar." The most recent data for 2007 show that private insurers get a little less than 7 percent of the nation's health care spending. The 7 percent number also includes some of the administrative costs of government health insurance programs and charity programs, but the center said most of that is for private insurers. We reviewed another study done by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office. It looked at administrative costs from a different angle, trying to focus on what percentage of health insurance premiums went to patient costs. Keep in mind, spending on private health insurance premiums is less than all national health care spending, which includes government spending for Medicare and Medicaid, and other expenditures. The CBO included a bunch of things under administrative costs: marketing; claims processing; managing contracts with doctors and hospitals; quality assurance; regulatory compliance; information technology expenses; general overhead; profits and taxes. It found that the percentage of premiums going to all these activities was 12 percent. We asked Kennedy's office about his statement, and staffers said Kennedy meant to say that he was talking about administrative expenses throughout the health care system. They sent us a study from the New England Journal of Medicine that examined administrative costs for doctors, hospitals, nursing homes, home care agencies and employers who provide insurance. The study found total administrative costs for all those groups accounted for 31 percent of health care expenditures in the United States. Still, that's not anywhere close to what Kennedy said. He said that "One-third of the health care dollar goes to no such thing as health care; it goes to the insurance companies." The actual number is about 7 percent. We rate Kennedy's statement False.

pomt-14443	"When you're white ... you don't know what it's like to be poor."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/mar/07/bernie-sanders/bernie-sanders-wrong-say-when-youre-white-you-dont/	During the Democratic debate in economically distressed and racially diverse Flint, Mich., CNN’s Don Lemon asked both Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders the same question: "In a speech about policing," Lemon said, "the FBI director, James Comey, borrowed a phrase saying, ‘Everyone is a little bit racist.’ What racial blind spot do you have?" When it was Sanders’ turn to answer, he began by talking about several specific examples of racial discrimination. He then drew a contrast with what whites experience. "When you’re white, you don’t know what it’s like to be living in a ghetto. You don’t know what it’s like to be poor. You don’t know what it’s like to be hassled when you walk down the street or you get dragged out of a car," Sanders said. Several readers asked us to take a closer look at Sanders’ comment that "when you're white ... you don't know what it's like to be poor." Sanders' point was that white people haven’t had to contend with racism based on skin color. But when he moves into the subject of whites’ experience with poverty, he’s on weak ground. Sanders’ suggestion that white Americans haven’t experienced poverty is undercut by statistics calculated by the U.S. Census Bureau. Since the 1960s, the Census Bureau has tracked the numbers and percentages of Americans by race who have an income level that puts them at the poverty line. Here’s the most recent data, for 2014: Category Number in poverty Poverty rate Americans of all races 46.7 million 14.8 percent White 19.7 million 10.1 percent African-American 10.8 million 26.2 percent Hispanic 13.1 million 23.6 percent Asian-American 2.1 million 12.0 percent By this measure, Sanders was certainly wrong to suggest that whites haven’t experienced poverty. In 2014, there were actually more white Americans in poverty -- 19.7 million -- than members of any other group. Part of the reason, of course, is that there are more white Americans than there are members of minority groups overall. (Whites account for 62 percent of the population.) Still, even though whites have a lower poverty rate than other groups -- roughly 10 percent -- even that percentage is hardly trivial. The numbers are similar if you raise the income level slightly. At 125 percent of the poverty level, the number of white Americans rises to about 26.5 million. That’s a lot of white people who are in or near poverty. "This was a misstatement. A lot of white people know what it’s like to be poor," said Julia Isaacs, a senior fellow at the Urban Institute. If you look at the poor as a group, minorities are disproportionately represented. Still, the white population is large enough that the majority of the people in poverty are white. That’s been the case since at least 1970. We calculated the racial and ethnic makeup of the population at the poverty line in roughly 10-year intervals, using data for the four categories above. Census data is available back to 1990 for all four groups, and they exist for all but Asians back to about 1970. Year Percentage of people in poverty who were white Percentage of people in poverty who were black Percentage of people in poverty who were Hispanic Percentage of people in poverty who were Asian 2014 54 19 23 4 2010 54 19 24 3 2000 56 21 20 3 1990 57 25 15 2 1980 62 27 11 NA 1970 64 28 9* NA * Data is for 1972 It’s easiest to grasp the scope of white poverty when using the following graphic, which was provided to us by Christopher Wimer, a research scientist at the Columbia University Population Research Center. It’s similar to the chart above, except that it uses a more precise, though still experimental, measurement of poverty that is adjusted for geography, government benefits and other factors not captured in the traditional poverty measurement. The share of whites in the population of Americans in poverty is shown in purple. As the chart indicates, the white share has fallen, but it’s still the largest of any of the four groups studied. Sanders said the day after the debate that he misspoke, telling reporters, "What I meant to say is when you talk about ghettos traditionally, what you talk about is African-American communities. There is nobody on this campaign … who's talked about poverty, whether it's in the white community, the black community, the Latino community, more than I have." Our ruling Sanders says that "when you're white ... you don't know what it's like to be poor." On the contrary -- the most recent figures show that nearly 20 million white Americans are experiencing poverty. While that’s smaller as a percentage than it is for other racial and ethnic groups, that’s still a lot of people. In raw numbers, it’s actually more than any other group. We rate his claim False.

pomt-00147	Says Tony Evers will "raise the gas tax by as much as a dollar a gallon."	mostly false	/wisconsin/statements/2018/oct/24/scott-walker/tony-evers-open-raising-gas-tax-scott-walker-one-s/	In a video ad that appears on screens mounted on 3,000 gas pumps across Wisconsin, Republican Gov. Scott Walker attacks his Democratic challenger, state schools superintendent Tony Evers, over the state gas tax. Wearing a Milwaukee Brewers jacket, Walker says in the 15-second spot released Oct. 9, 2018: "Hi, it’s Scott Walker. Good thing you’re filling up, because if Tony Evers wins, he’ll raise the gas tax by as much as a dollar a gallon." Walker has focused on the gas tax for months ahead of the Nov. 6, 2018 election. A week after the gas pump ad came out, he repeated the $1 claim about Evers in a TV ad. And the $1 claim is also made in a previous TV ad by Americans for Prosperity-Wisconsin. All our Tony Evers and Scott Walker fact checks in the governor’s race. We’ve already been down this road. And what Walker says at the pump goes too far. Previous fact check When Walkers claimed Evers will "raise property taxes, raise income taxes and raise gas taxes by as much as a dollar a gallon," our rating was Half True. The claim was more accurate on some taxes and less on others. All our Tammy Baldwin and Leah Vukmir fact checks in the U.S. Senate race. What we found regarding the gas tax: On Aug. 15, 2018, the day after Evers won the primary election, Walker said Evers might be willing to quadruple the state’s 32.9 cents-per-gallon state gas tax because Evers hadn't said how much he would be willing to increase it. Later that morning, a reporter asked Evers about Walker’s comment and whether he would raise the gas tax by $1. Evers responded more generally by saying: "I would support looking at anything, whether it’s removing tax credits, whether it’s slimming down state government, whether it’s gas taxes. Everything is on the table." But by the afternoon, Evers said Walker was lying about his views on the gas tax. "The only thing I ever said about that," Evers declared, "is that every possible revenue source is on the table." Evers has also said, in speaking about road funding, he "has no range" in terms of how high of an increase in the gas tax he would consider. And he has said that a $1 increase is "ridiculous." So, saying Evers will raise gas taxes by up to $1 per gallon, when he has only said he would consider raising the tax some amount, goes too far. And when we asked Walker’s campaign to back Walker’s gas-pump statement, the campaign didn’t cite anything new Evers has said since our earlier fact check. Like us on Facebook. Follow us on Twitter: @PolitiFactWisc. Our rating Walker says Evers will "raise the gas tax by as much as a dollar a gallon." Evers has said he is open to raising the tax, which is now 32.9 cents per gallon, but the $1 figure comes from Walker. While Evers has said he "has no range" of how large an increase he would consider, he has called a $1 increase "ridiculous." For a statement that has an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression, our rating is Mostly False.

The video from the Texas lieutenant governor shows Obama golfing or riding a golf cart along with snippets of others speaking about the nation’s economic troubles. The advertisement’s money moment, though, lies in these claims that appear in red letters next to video of Obama, in shorts, golfing: "6.4 million more Americans living in poverty under President Obama" and "over 90 rounds of golf." We’re separately analyzing Dewhurst’s charge about American poverty. But is he right that Obama has played over 90 rounds of golf, meaning as many as 1,620 holes? Many presidents have played golf, including 15 of the 18 presidents before Obama, according to a January 2009 Golf Digest article,The magazine ranked John F. Kennedy as the best previous presidential golfer, and his predecessor, Dwight Eisenhower, as second-best; Eisenhower, the article says, had a putting green outside the Oval Office. As Dewhurst’s backup for the Obama claim, his campaign pointed us to a January 2012 Washington Post blog post noting that Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney had bemoaned Obama’s "90 rounds" at the Jan. 23, 2012, GOP presidential debate in Tampa. According to the debate transcript, Romney said: "We have to have a president who understands how to get an economy going again. He does not. He plays 90 rounds of golf when you have 25 million people out of work." He later brought up the 90 rounds again at a Michigan campaign event, according to a Feb. 14, 2012, article in the Detroit News. Dewhurst spokesman Matt Hirsch also offered as backup a Dec. 27, 2011, blog post by Tina Korbe on the Hot Air website, which describes itself as "the leading conservative blog for breaking news and commentary covering the Republican primary, the 2012 election, politics, media, and culture." Korbe’s post states, in part: "Not only did Barack Obama golf on Christmas day, but he hit the links yesterday, too — and that round marked the 90th of his presidency." Korbe’s post linked to a Dec. 26, 2011, blog post by White House correspondent Keith Koffler, whose website is WhiteHouseDossier.com. Koffler’s post said: "After an hour of hiking, President Obama Monday got down to the serious business at hand, heading out to golf for the second day in his first three days of vacation. He was back on the course at Marine Corps Base Hawaii. With this one, Obama reaches a new milestone, having gone golfing 90 times in less than three years as president." His summary also says that this was "the 32nd time he’s been on the links this year, a record for the president. His 32 outings eclipses the 2010 mark of 30 and is far ahead of his 2009 tally of 28 rounds as president." By email, we asked Koffler about those figures. He replied that as of April 4, 2012, the president had taken in 93 golf outings, counting one in 2012 and 34 in 2011. We wondered how the frequency of Obama’s golf outings compared to such expeditions by other presidents. Koffler replied: "I don't have a comparison to other presidents, though (George W.) Bush stopped in 2003." Bush said in a May 2008 interview with Politico and Yahoo News that he decided to forgo golf after the August 2003 bombing of the United Nations headquarters in Baghdad, which killed Sergio Vieira de Mello, the top U.N. official in Iraq and the organization’s high commissioner for human rights. "I remember when de Mello, who was at the U.N., got killed in Baghdad as a result of these murderers taking this good man's life," Bush said, according to Politico. "I was playing golf — I think I was in Central Texas — and they pulled me off the golf course and I said, ‘It's just not worth it any more to do.’" We didn’t immediately hear back from the White House about how often Obama has gone golfing. Separately, CBS News White House reporter Mark Knoller, who tracks each president’s activities, responded to our inquiry by pointing out that he said on Twitter April 2, 2012, that Obama had just played his first round of golf of the year, spending five hours on a course the day before. Knoller told us by email that the round was Obama’s 93rd as president. We rate Dewhurst’s claim as True.	None	David Dewhurst	None	None	None	2012-04-04T18:20:55	2012-04-04	['None']
pomt-00785	"We have towns in West Texas that are out of water, that are having to truck in water."	mostly false	/texas/statements/2015/apr/08/sid-miller/sid-miller-says-we-have-towns-west-texas-are-out-w/	At a March 2015 symposium on water in Texas, the state’s agriculture commissioner was asked about his agency’s actions in that realm. Sid Miller, a former legislator who took office in January 2015, replied that just that week he’d signed off on water wells being drilled in two West Texas communities with less than 180-day water supplies. Miller, a Republican, continued: "We have towns in West Texas that are out of water, that are having to truck in water." We were familiar with occasional past shortages. But is that happening again? When we requested Miller’s backup information, Agriculture Department spokesman Bryan Black sent us web links to news reports. One was a January 2012 NPR news report on Spicewood Beach, a Burnet County town northwest of Austin, having to truck in water. Then again, conditions there were expected to rebound, according to a June 2013 Austin American-Statesman news story, thanks to new water wells drilled near Lake Travis and a new water treatment plant. Black also pointed out a June 2013 Texas Tribune news story on the West Texas town of Barnhart, which was then out of water. To gauge Barnhart’s conditions of late, we reached John Nanny, an Irion County commissioner who serves on the board of the Barnhart Water Supply Corp. By phone, Nanny said drinking water last had to be trucked in during July and August 2014 — at quite a cost, he said. "We can’t afford to do that," he said, adding that a second well was dug, helping to shore up supplies to about 50 customers. Black didn’t specify communities that had no water when Miller, um, piped up. Texas Commission on Environmental Quality Next, we reached out to the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality. By email, spokesman Terry Clawson said that as of March 12, 2015, the agency wasn’t aware of any public water systems hauling in water. That said, Clawson wrote, the Berry Oaks Water Company in Comal County, between Austin and San Antonio, intermittently hauls water because of summer shortfalls. Clawson emailed us a chart indicating the water system is building a well and water plant, to be up and running, Clawson said, by mid-May 2015. Clawson said the chart represents the agency’s weekly updated High Priority Water System List, which reflects water-supply conditions self-reported to the commission — meaning it shouldn’t be read as all-inclusive. "There may be systems that have either not reported their status or are not aware of their conditions," Clawson said. In a follow-up note, Clawson specified 11 public water systems previously reported as having to haul (or truck) in drinking water due to persistent drought. He attached a chart describing each instance. In another email, Black mentioned most of the same systems. The commission chart listed five water systems located somewhere on the vast west side of Texas, specifically ones in Burnet County, northwest of Austin; Barnhart in Irion County, west of San Angelo; Medina County, west of San Antonio; Hood County, southwest of Fort Worth; and Tom Green County, whose county seat is San Angelo. Then again, in each event, according to the chart, the Texas Department of Agriculture or the water system itself funded improvements restoring supply. Our ruling Miller said: "We have towns in West Texas that are out of water." In recent years, towns around Texas occasionally ran dry until new wells or water plants met needs. But Miller named no towns out of water of late nor did we identify any. We rate the statement Mostly False. MOSTLY FALSE – The statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression.

pomt-05920	"Federal, state and local governments have subsidized the production of the Volt to the tune of estimates between $50,000 and $250,000 per vehicle sold."	half-true	/ohio/statements/2012/jan/31/jim-jordan/jim-jordan-says-subsidy-volt-averages-out-much-250/	Political charges were in the air at a Jan. 25, 2012, congressional hearing on the Chevrolet Volt chaired by Republican Rep. Jim Jordan, a staunch critic of the Obama administration’s intervention in the General Motors bankruptcy. Jordan, from Ohio’s Champaign County, said he called the hearing to explore whether the government’s involvement in General Motors swayed how the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration informed consumers about crash tests that caused fires in the hybrid electric vehicles’ batteries. At the hearing, his committee released a report titled: "Government Motors: A Preliminary Report on the Effects of Bailouts and Politics on the Obama Administration’s Ability to Protect American Consumers." He opened the hearing with a statement that outlined some of his beefs with the government’s role in GM, including tax subsidies to the Volt. "Total federal, state and local governments have subsidized the production of the Volt to the tune of estimates between $50,000 and $250,000 per vehicle sold," said Jordan. That number seemed shocking for a car with a low-end retail price of $31,645, so we asked Jordan’s office where it came from. His spokeswoman said his statement relied on a Dec. 21 study from Michigan’s Mackinac Center for Public Policy - which estimated that each of the 6,000 Volts sold up until that date has received between $50,000 and $250,000 in subsidies. Its analysis tallied up nearly $3 billion worth of state and federal assistance it said were offered for the Volt’s development and production. It cited 18 tax credits and government subsidies for General Motors and its suppliers - such as a $105.9 million U.S. Department of Energy grant to the General Motors plant in Brownstown Township southwest of Detroit, a $106 million state job retention credit for its Detroit-Hamtramck plant and up to $100 million in refundable battery credits for a Volt battery supplier called Compact Power. The biggest slice of that money - $1.5 billion - comes from a $7,500 tax credit that the IRS offered to the the first 200,000 buyers of the Volt, or other electric cars from GM. Similar credits are available to buyers of other manufacturers’ electric vehicles. When author James Hohman compiled his statistics, roughly 6,000 Volts had been sold. By the time Jordan held his hearing, GM said the vehicle’s sales were around 8,000. "GM has estimated they’ve sold 6,000 Volts so far," said Mackinac’s report on Hohman’s work. "That would mean each of the 6,000 Volts sold would be subsidized between $50,000 and $250,000, depending on how many government subsidy milestones are reached." The report said it didn’t include subsidies that could boost the level of government aid, such as the land for one of the GM assembly plants being acquired through eminent domain by General Motors. Hohman said the Volt "might be the most government-supported car since the Trabant," a car that was made by the formerly communist state of East Germany. Mackinac’s data was attacked immediately. An analysis in The Street on Dec. 22, 2011, criticized its methodology of dividing $1.5 billion in subsidies by the 6,000 cars sold to reach his $250,000 per vehicle number. The Street, a digital financial media company established in 1996, said the author would have reached a very different statistic if the study had been done at the end of 2012 - when GM projects it will have made 60,000 of the cars. It said that technology from the car will be used in roughly 60 million vehicles over the next in 25 years, which would make for a subsidy of roughly $25 per car. "The absurdity of the math used can be further shown by asking what the study would have yielded if it had been done six months ago or a year ago," said The Street. "Six months ago, 3,000 Volts had been sold and therefore the implied subsidy was $500,000 per car - half as many cars, twice the subsidy per car. One year ago, the first Volt was sold and therefore this one car must have cost $1.5 billion, according to the reasoning by the people who wrote the headlines around this study." General Motors spokesman Greg Martin said Mackinac’s study "is not even in the same area code as accurate." He said the study compiled "every conceivable" energy battery subsidy over the past several years, whether or not it had anything to do with the Volt, added it up and "came up with this outrageous $250,000 subsidy per Volt." For example, five of the tax credits and loans cited in Mackinac’s report, totaling more than $388 million - went to a battery maker called A123 that has nothing to do with the Volt, Martin said. He says it’s fair to question the wisdom of of subsidies and consumer incentives for vehicle purchases, but a serious debate "should not be clouded and distracted by fun and games with numbers." In an emailed response to questions about his study, Hohman said its high-end $250,000 estimate includes the A123 money that GM disputes "because, at the time the incentives were being awarded, both government policy makers and the company itself were unsure about the suppliers." "However, with the Volt in mind as the standard bearer for the idea of a mass produced American-made EV, it was unlikely that a lot of these deals would have been approved--or certainly approved at the levels offered -- without the Volt." Hohman’s email said. Although Hohman says a number of Volt-associated projects got local government assistance in addition to federal and state aid, he excluded those incentives from his calculations because they were inconsistently reported. Hohman said he felt that calculating the maximum amount of assistance offered to the Volt added valuable context to discussions about the vehicle. He said the federal and state entities that awarded incentives to the project "never got together to try to figure out just how much each car would receive." He said The Street was correct to assert that the per-vehicle subsidy he calculated would decrease as more vehicles are sold, but said that’s a "clear implication from how we describe the calculations." Ernest Goss, an economist at Nebraska’s Creighton University who is critical of tax incentives to large companies, said such incentives often lead to construction of projects that would not be built otherwise and may be mistakes. He said he believes the Chevrolet Volt "is very costly to the taxpayer and probably not worth the subsidy," but the scope of government subsidies can be difficult to gauge. "The question is, what subsidies do you count?" says Goss. "There is no doubt there have been significant subsidies going to GM, which is problematic, given that GM was bailed out and taxpayers still own a significant share of GM." So, where does that leave Jordan’s assertion? Jordan’s claim is partially accurate. He stated it as fact, relying on the study from the Mackinac Center. That study did estimate the Volt has received between $50,000 and $250,000 in aid per vehicle, although its tally did not include local government aid, as Jordan said. And his underlying point is true -- that there has been much subsidy directed toward development of the Volt. But the claim leaves out important details that are need to fully understand the truth. Mackinac’s numbers seem inexact and fluid and designed to make headlines at the expense of accuracy. They include money that went to a company that doesn’t supply the Volt. And the per-vehicle tally considers all aid awarded at a time when Volt sales are just beginning. That figure will fall dramatically -- a point the study’s author concedes -- as more Volts and cars that use its technology are sold, with one analysis citing a figure of $25 per car if projected out over the next 25 years. On the Truth-O-Meter, Jordan’s claim rates Half True.	None	Jim Jordan	None	None	None	2012-01-31T06:00:00	2012-01-25	['None']
pomt-14106	Says Hillary Clinton "wants to abolish the Second Amendment."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/may/11/donald-trump/donald-trump-falsely-claims-hillary-clinton-wants-/	Donald Trump accused Hillary Clinton of coming after your guns and your right to them. "Hillary Clinton wants to abolish the Second Amendment," Trump said May 7 at a rally in Washington. "Hillary Clinton wants to take your guns away, and she wants to abolish the Second Amendment." We asked the Trump campaign for evidence for this claim, but they didn’t get back to us. The Clinton campaign vehemently denied it. "Of course Hillary Clinton does not want to repeal the Second Amendment," Clinton spokesman Josh Schwerin said. We found no evidence that Clinton has ever advocated for repealing or abolishing the Second Amendment. Schwerin’s comments are largely consistent with what Clinton has said in the past few years about the right to bear arms. However, gun rights advocates argue that it’s reasonable to infer from a few of Clinton’s comments that she wants to roll back the Second Amendment as it’s currently interpreted. Straight shooting on the campaign trail In both her 2008 and 2016 White House bids, Clinton has called for stronger background check requirements all the while affirming her support for the right to bear arms. Clinton does want to keep guns out of the hands of "people we all agree shouldn't have them — domestic abusers, violent felons, and dangerously mentally ill people," said Dan Gross, president of the Brady Campaign to Prevent Violence. But Trump’s charge exaggerates the controls she wants to put in place and ignores what she has said on the record. "I believe in the Second Amendment. People have a right to bear arms. But I also believe that we can common-sensically approach this," she said in a January 2008 Democratic presidential debate. In response to the on-air murders of a news crew in Virginia in August 2015, she said, "We are smart enough, compassionate enough to balance legitimate Second Amendment rights concerns with preventive measures and control measures, so whatever motivated this murderer ... we will not see more needless, senseless deaths." More recently, she tweeted in April 2016, "We can protect our Second Amendment rights AND take commonsense steps to prevent gun violence. It’s just a question of whether we choose to." Setting aside the bulk of Clinton’s comments on protecting the Second Amendment (examples here, here, here, here, here and here), we’ll now go over two points that some gun rights advocates and experts say gives Trump’s charge some credence. Two smoking guns? Clinton riled the gun lobby with two eyebrow-raising comments last fall. Clinton said in October 2015 that a national gun buyback program like Australia’s compulsory program was "worth looking into." After a gunman killed 35 people in Port Arthur, Tasmania, in 1996, Australia banned semiautomatic and automatic weapons and enacted a mandatory buyback of the newly prohibited guns. That program is "incompatible with private ownership of guns," said Eugene Volokh, a law professor at the University of California, Los Angeles. Dave Kopel, a pro-gun rights attorney and research director of the conservative Independence Institute in Denver, equates her musing about Australia’s program as "wanting to abolish the Second Amendment." (The NRA shares this view.) The full context of Clinton’s response, however, suggests she may have misspoken or not fully understood Australia’s program, as she also evoked voluntary buybacks as potential models for a U.S. program. "Communities have done that in our country. Several communities have done gun buyback programs. But I think it would be worth considering on the national level if that could be arranged," she said, before comparing the buybacks to Cash for Clunkers, the Obama administration’s voluntary vehicle trade-in program. Second, Clinton said she disagrees with the the Supreme Court’s landmark ruling in District of Columbia v. Heller. In a 5-4 decision, the Court struck down Washington’s handgun ban and recognized that the Second Amendment applies to the individual’s right to bear arms. "The Supreme Court is wrong on the Second Amendment," she said in a leaked recording of a private fundraiser. Volokh called the comment "a smoking gun" that bolsters Trump’s charge. Reversing Heller, said Kopel, would be a huge blow to the individual right to bear arms They both pointed out that former Justice Department officials under President Bill Clinton and his appointees Stephen Breyer and Ruth Bader Ginsburg argued in Heller that gun regulations do not violate the Second Amendment because it primarily pertains to a well-regulated militia and not the individual right to bear arms. Put both comments together, and Trump is correct, said NRA spokeswoman Amy Hunter. UCLA Second Amendment expert Adam Winkler, meanwhile, said that the accuracy of Trump’s charge depends on Clinton’s grounds for rejecting Heller. (According to news reports from the 2008 election, she supported Washington’s handgun ban.) "If she thought the reasoning was wrong, but the result right, then she would fit in with a number of strong pro-gun advocates," he said. "If, however, she thought there should be no protection for gun rights, then Trump's claim comes closer to the truth." The Clinton campaign told us Clinton "believes Heller was wrongly decided in that cities and states should have the power to craft common sense laws to keep their residents safe." This suggests Clinton disagrees with the court declaring the district’s ban on handguns unconstitutional, not necessarily the individual right itself — a position that’s more or less in line with the George W. Bush administration’s position on Heller of recognizing the right but allowing reasonable curtailment. Our ruling Trump said, "Hillary Clinton wants to abolish the Second Amendment." We found no evidence of Clinton ever saying verbatim or suggesting explicitly that she wants to abolish the Second Amendment, and the bulk of Clinton’s comments suggest the opposite. She has repeatedly said she wants to protect the right to bear arms while enacting measures to prevent gun violence. Gun advocates say Trump’s claim is backed up by Clinton’s openness to a gun buyback program and her disagreement with a Supreme Court decision on the Second Amendment. But whether or not these two cherry-picked comments actually reveal Clinton’s intentions is a matter of interpretation. For this claim to hold water, the support for Second Amendment abolition needs to be more direct. So we rate it False. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/132d21e9-e2e0-4082-b319-0d67d30341e8	None	Donald Trump	None	None	None	2016-05-11T16:45:56	2016-05-07	['None']
pomt-00330	"Myrtle Beach man who shot at Hurricane Florence dies after bullet ricochets." ​	pants on fire!	/facebook-fact-checks/statements/2018/sep/19/blog-posting/no-one-died-shooting-hurricane-florence/	More than 34,000 people marked themselves as "going" to a Facebook event called "Shooting guns at Hurricane Florence to scare it away." The description of the Facebook event includes a disclaimer: "Do not actually discharge firearms into the air. You could kill someone and you cannot frighten a hurricane. I cant believe I actually have to write this." However, one website pointed to the event and claimed it led to tragedy when a "Myrtle Beach man" did just that: shot a gun at a hurricane. "The 33-year old is believed to have fired a large calibre (sic) weapon earlier this afternoon; however, the bullet ricocheted and ended up entering the man’s head," the post said. "It’s believed he died instantly." This story was made up. It was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) Partway through the story, the "Myrtle Beach man" is identified as a man from Florence, which is the name of the hurricane as well as a South Carolina city further inland. Myrtle Beach’s local newspaper, Myrtle Beach Online, contacted police departments in both Florence and Myrtle Beach, and neither was aware of such an incident. "I have not heard a a single call in any way, shape or form about anything like that," a police corporal in Myrtle Beach told the newspaper. "The only thing I’ve heard about that was a satirical group on Facebook," Florence Police Department Lt. Mike Brandt told PolitiFact. "There were no reports of shooting at the hurricane in the city limits of Florence." The story was published on CGC News, a blog that was created Sept. 9, 2018 according to whois.com, which tracks website domains. No credible news outlets covering the storm have picked up this story. This isn’t the first time Facebookers have somewhat jokingly declared they’d shoot at an incoming storm. The joke Facebook event is similar to one that popped up last year: "Shoot At Hurricane Irma." The creator was a bored 22-year-old who said at the time that the joke became "something a little out of my control" after more than 43,000 people RSVPed. While the Facebook event "Shooting guns at Hurricane Florence to scare it away" has generated its fair share of interested attendees, there is no credible evidence that anyone died trying to square off against the hurricane.

pomt-01757	"The House of Representatives has never sued a sitting president in all of U.S. history."	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2014/jul/31/nancy-pelosi/nancy-pelosi-says-us-house-has-never-sued-sitting-/	The U.S. House of Representatives recently voted to sue President Barack Obama for allegedly overstepping the powers of his office. While the suit raises thorny legal questions about the limits of presidential power, it’s also being used by both sides to fire up their base in advance of the midterm elections. The suit, spearheaded by House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, was approved largely along party lines. Democrats argued that it’s an example of the Republican majority playing politics rather than tackling urgent policy issues, such as immigration. Indeed, House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., used the looming vote to approve the suit in a recent fundraising pitch, as reported by NBC News. "Boehner is planning a vote to sue the president," Pelosi wrote. "The House of Representatives has never sued a sitting president in all of U.S. history. And if they do it, impeachment may very well be the next step." We wondered whether Pelosi is correct that "the House of Representatives has never sued a sitting president in all of U.S. history." We found that she’s right the House as a whole has never sued the president. However, we think it’s worth noting that individual lawmakers and groups of lawmakers have sued the president in the past -- frequently. In fact, we found at least 14 instances in the last four decades alone. This doesn’t make Pelosi’s carefully worded claim inaccurate, but it's worth adding important context. We should note that these challenges to presidential authority generally failed, particularly challenges over whether Congress or the president has the right to initiate military action. Often, the suits’ Achilles heel was the courts’ determination that the lawmakers lacked the "standing" -- basically, a demonstrable injury -- to file such a suit. This succession of negative rulings for Congress has presented the plaintiffs against Obama with an uphill legal climb, analysts say. Here’s a rundown of the 14 lawsuits we found: • Senate Select Committee on Presidential Campaign Activities vs. Nixon (1974). This was one of the Watergate-era cases involving what evidence President Richard Nixon had to turn over to investigators that heightened the pressure on Nixon to resign. • Drummond vs. Bunker (1977). William R. Drummond, a citizen of the Panama Canal Zone, sued President Jimmy Carter to stop his administration from negotiating about handing over the then-U.S.-held canal zone to Panama, arguing that only Congress possessed that right. Six members of Congress intervened in the case alongside Drummond, arguing that the executive branch was depriving them of their constitutionally protected vote. • Goldwater vs. Carter (1979). Several lawmakers, led by Sen. Barry Goldwater, R-Ariz., sued Carter, arguing that the president had bypassed Congress by ending a defense pact with Taiwan. • Crockett vs. Reagan (1982). Sixteen senators and 13 House members asked a federal court to rule that the dispatching of several dozen U.S. military personnel to El Salvador by President Ronald Reagan contradicted Congress’s war powers and the Foreign Assistance Act. • Sanchez-Espinoza vs. Reagan (1983). Twelve House members joined with 12 Nicaraguan citizens and two American citizens seeking damages and a declaration that Reagan had violated war powers restrictions by pursuing the overthrow of the Nicaraguan government. • Conyers vs. Reagan (1984). Eleven House members sued Reagan, arguing that his use of military force in Grenada had usurped Congress’s war powers. • Lowry vs. Reagan (1987). Ten House members sued Reagan on war powers grounds, this time over the president’s approval of escort operations for reflagged Kuwaiti tankers in the Persian Gulf. • Dellums vs. Bush (1990). One senator and 53 House members sued President George H.W. Bush to stop him from attacking Iraq without approval from Congress during the run-up to what became the Persian Gulf War. • Raines vs. Byrd (1997). Six members of Congress who had voted against giving the president the authority to veto individual items in bills -- rather than just entire bills -- sued over the act’s constitutionality. • Chenoweth vs. Clinton (1999). Four House members sued President Bill Clinton over his creation by executive order of the American Heritage Rivers Initiative, saying it exceeded his authority as president. • Campbell vs. Clinton (2000). Thirty-one members of Congress sued Clinton on war powers grounds for his decision to send military forces to participate in a NATO-organized campaign of airstrikes in the former Yugoslavia. • Kucinich vs. Bush (2002). Rep. Dennis Kucinich, D-Ohio, sued President George W. Bush over the administration’s unilateral withdrawal from an anti-ballistic missile treaty, arguing that the executive branch could not do that without Congress’ consent. • Doe vs. Bush (2003). Twelve House members joined with several dozen servicemembers and their families to sue Bush on war-powers grounds, seeking to stop a United States-led invasion of Iraq. • Kucinich vs. Obama (2011). Kucinich also sued Bush’s successor, Obama, on war-powers grounds, saying that his intervention in Libya was unconstitutional. Drew Hammill, a spokesman Pelosi, said her statement is "accurate" because "she is clearly referring to the ‘House of Representatives,’ not individual members of Congress." Kermit Roosevelt, a law professor at the University of Pennsylvania, agreed that Pelosi has some justification for singling out a lawsuit by the whole House. Having a majority of the House on board "suggests the grievance may be more legitimate," Roosevelt said, though he added that this scenario also "suggests that the House should be able to use the powers the Constitution gives it -- our familiar system of checks and balances -- rather than trying to enlist the judiciary in a political struggle." Still, while Pelosi’s claim is literally accurate, legal observers suggested that her careful wording selectively downplays a long history of clashes between the two branches of government. Elizabeth Slattery, a legal fellow with the conservative Heritage Foundation, agreed, saying that Pelosi’s statement is "technically accurate," but "misleading" "Typically, suits are brought against other executive branch officials, rather than the president directly," she said. Stan Brand, a veteran Washington attorney who served as general counsel to the U.S. House under the late Speaker Thomas P. "Tip" O'Neill, D-Mass., said, "It may be that the House as an institution has never sued a president, but undoubtedly there have been cases where challenges to presidential actions have occurred. I am not impressed by the claim that this is the first such suit, because it elevates form over substance. The much more interesting issues for me are the jurisprudential separation-of-powers implications of such litigation." Our ruling Pelosi said "the House of Representatives has never sued a sitting president in all of U.S. history."

pomt-07308	"You can't give a child an aspirin in school without permission. You can't do any kind of medication, but we can secretly take the child off and have an abortion."	true	/florida/statements/2011/may/17/steve-oelrich/state-senator-claims-school-nurses-cant-give-aspir/	In a show of Republican muscle, Florida lawmakers passed several bills relating to abortion during this year’s legislative session. One proposal awaiting the signature of Gov. Rick Scott requires young women who want a judge to waive the parental-notification requirement to obtain the waiver in a circuit court closer to their home rather than a wider-reaching appeals court. Opponents insist HB 1247 violates the privacy of young women who live in small communities and know most people in their area, including people who work at the courthouse. But supporters say it prevents teens from crossing the state to find a sympathetic judge in order to get an abortion without their parents’ knowledge. Sen. Steve Oelrich, a Republican from Gainesville and cosponsor of the Senate version, had an interesting take during a May 5, 2011, debate on the Senate floor. "You can’t give a child an aspirin in school without permission," he said. "You can’t do any kind of medication, but we can secretly take the child off and have an abortion. We should support it (HB 1247) with all our hearts and souls if parental responsibility means anything to us." Oelrich’s claim left us wondering: Is it really that hard for students to get over-the-counter medication at school? We should explain that we're not ruling on Oelrich's statement that young women can "secretly" have abortions. We already know this is legal in certain cases under Florida law. Implementation of HB 1247 would limit which courts can make the decisions for women who seek waivers of the parental notification law, not strip their ability to have secret procedures. Florida law The Florida Statutes have straightforward directions for handling prescription medication at school. The law requires a student’s parent to submit a written statement with the medicine that permits a trained school official to administer a dose. The note must also explain why the medicine must be taken during the school day. The prescription medicine must be administered at school by a qualified official and then be counted, stored in the original container, and kept in a secured place. Beyond that, the law does not address the use of over-the-counter medication. The statutes leave that decision up to local school districts. We set out to check each one to learn if Oelrich's claim is true. We tracked down policies for 62 of 67 counties. Most were available online. It took time to be sure, but Oelrich is right. Every district requires parental consent for non-prescription medication, sometimes in writing and sometimes by phone. Notifying a parent is the minimum step for many other districts, including Charlotte, Baker and Miami-Dade. These districts require a physician's note, too. "We don’t administer anything in Charlotte County without doctors' orders," said Gail Buck, supervisor of the county’s school health services. "No cough drops, no Tylenol." Aspirin warnings There's another part to this claim: Oelrich specifically invoked aspirin on the Senate floor. Some of the school nurses we interviewed practically shuddered at the word. The reason? Aspirin use among children is linked to the development of Reye's Syndrome, a lethal disease that sets in after a viral infection and affects all organs of the body, according to the National Reye's Syndrome Foundation. The National Institutes of Health and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention are among entities that recommend not using aspirin, or combination medicine containing aspirin, for children under 19 during fever-causing illnesses. "We stay away from all aspirin products and stuff," said Catherine Reckenwald, student health specialist for Citrus County Schools. "You don’t know if a child has an allergy, so you need to have very specific instructions for each student." Reckenwald said Tylenol is more appropriate for children, but she does not keep a supply in her clinic. This is standard practice at most of the school health centers we contacted. "We do not have what is called 'standing orders,' " said Janice Karst, St. Lucie County School Board director of communications. In case you were wondering, students are allowed to self-administer epinephrine auto-injectors, metered dose inhalers, pancreatic enzyme supplements and diabetic supplies if they have a doctor's note and parental consent. Our ruling The thrust of Oelrich's point is correct: You can’t give a child an aspirin in school without permission. To administer any non-prescription medication, school officials must have approval from the parent. And in some cases, the schools also need a note from a doctor -- even for cough drops. While Oelrich is right about the permission part, he specifically mentioned aspirin so we should add that giving aspirin to children is considered risky because of the medicine's connection to a deadly disease. But that wasn't exactly Oelrich's point in a debate over abortion and a minor's right to privacy. We rate his claim True.	None	Steve Oelrich	None	None	None	2011-05-17T13:31:58	2011-05-17	['None']
pomt-11445	Says the U.S. steel and aluminum industry is "a fraction of what it once was."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2018/mar/13/donald-trump/donald-trump-right-aluminum-steel-industries-have-/	President Donald Trump announced a 25 percent tariff on steel and 10 percent tariff on aluminum, a move that Trump argued would protect an American metals industry beleaguered by foreign imports. "We’re doing tariffs on steel. We cannot lose our steel industry. It’s a fraction of what it once was. And we can’t lose our aluminum industry. Also a fraction of what it once was," Trump said March 6, two days before the tariffs were officially signed. We decided to take a closer look at how these industries have fared over time. Lower employment numbers Trump is correct that employment numbers for metals have fallen sharply. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com Steel and aluminum employment is significantly lower today than decades past. According to an analysis by the Council on Foreign Relations, U.S. steel employment peaked around 650,000 jobs in the 1950s, compared to around 140,000 today. An analysis by Bloomberg shows some 50,000 aluminum production jobs have disappeared since 1990, a roughly 46 percent reduction. As of December 2017, there were roughly 59,000 aluminum production jobs, according to Bloomberg. Experts cited a number of reasons why the metals industry has shed jobs, from improved factory logistics to the diminished power of unions to protect even unproductive workers. But the consensus view is that the biggest cause has been technological advances. "In terms of employment, the big story is automation across the board," said Gary Clyde Hufbauer, a fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, which generally supports free trade. So how many of these jobs were squeezed out by foreign imports? J. Bradford Jensen, a professor of international business at Georgetown University’s McDonough School of Business, told us that "imports did have something to do with the loss of employment in steel and aluminum, but the more important factor is technological change and productivity growth." "Tariffs won't change that, much like relaxing regulations on coal and pollution will not bring back many coal-mining jobs," he said. In short, compared with decades past, the U.S. metals industry can now do more with less. "If you want to know why the steel industry employs so fewer workers than in decades past, there is the answer," wrote Daniel Griswold, a senior researcher at the free-market Mercatus Center at George Mason University. So Trump is correct that employment levels in the the metal industry are a fraction of what they once were, though it’s worth noting experts tended to attribute this more to automation than foreign imports. Steel output Evaluating Trump’s statement is trickier when it comes to steel and aluminum production. The United States produced about 82 million tons of raw steel in 2017, according to a U.S. Geological Survey estimate. As the chart below shows, that’s well below the peak 137 million tons of steel produced in 1973. See Figure 2 on PolitiFact.com Steel production was certainly higher during the 1960s and 1970s. However, other than these two decades, U.S. steel output has occupied a fairly narrow band in the post-war era, and current output levels far exceed production levels from before 1940. Experts we spoke to said it’s important to look at these numbers in context. Looking only at metric tons of production would not reflect improvements in product quality, for example, or declines in demand. Some noted that the primary metals industries now make up a smaller share of the modern economy than they did in the past. Aluminum output Aluminum is also a bit tricky because there are multiple ways to measure production. One method, known as primary production, involves producing aluminum from raw materials. U.S. primary production of aluminum rose steadily from the post-war era until around 1980, when it began a steady decline. That same period saw increased use of the secondary production, a manner of making aluminum from recycled scrap. Secondary production increased from 22 percent of aluminum production in 1980, to 64 percent of domestic production in 2016, according to the Commerce Department. Due to its robust aluminum recycling industry, the United States now leads the world in secondary aluminum production, according to the Commerce Department. See Figure 3 on PolitiFact.com "The recycling part is interesting in that it makes the point of declining need to worry about imports," said Michael J. Hicks, director of the Center for Business and Economic Research at Ball State University. "Use of aluminum is rising, but we aren’t extracting as much from the ground as we used to, in part because almost all the nation now recycles metals." Our ruling Trump said the U.S. steel and aluminum industry is "a fraction of what it once was." Trump is correct that employment levels in the metal industry are a fraction of what they once were, though experts attribute this more to automation than foreign imports. Steel output is also not the highest it’s ever been, though experts said it’s important to consider steel production in a broader context that includes improvements to steel as well as how output has responded to declining demand. While the amount of aluminum made from raw materials has declined since the early 1980s, the output of aluminum made from recycled materials has fairly steadily climbed since WWII, and the United States now leads the world in secondary aluminum production.

pomt-06779	Virginia has made "no progress on jobs" since Bob McDonnell took office.	false	/virginia/statements/2011/aug/18/democratic-party-virginia/virginia-democratic-party-claims-bob-mcdonnell-has/	The Virginia Democratic Party has not let up on its criticism of Gov. Bob McDonnell’s jobs record. Their latest salvo is a web video attacking McDonnell’s performance. "Despite the governor’s slick photo-ops and self congratulatory press releases, the reality is we have made no progress on jobs since he took office," the Virginia Democratic Party said in an August 5 statement about the video. So the commonwealth’s jobs picture hasn’t brightened at all since McDonnell took over? We wanted to see if that was true. To back up that assertion, Democrats pointed to a statement from the Commonwealth Institute for Fiscal Analysis, a Richmond think tank that said Virginia had made "no real progress" on job creation since the end of the recession in June 2009. The think tank examines economic issues facing low and moderate income residents. The group’s president, Michael Cassidy, noted in a July 22 statement that Virginia had more than 3.6 million jobs back in June 2009 and had about the same amount in June 2011. But McDonnell didn’t take over as governor until the middle of January 2010. His first full month in office was February 2010 -- at which time the number of jobs was a bit lower. In February 2010, there were 3,595,600 jobs in the state, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. In June 2011, the latest month for which figures were available, that had risen to 3,643,800. That means that since McDonnell has been governor, the state’s job rolls have increased by 48,200. The June 2011 employment numbers showed a drop of roughly 14,000 jobs from the previous month’s job figures, a fall-off that Cassidy noted had erased 23 percent of the jobs gained since February 2010. But even with that decline, there were still nearly 50,000 jobs gained overall since McDonnell took over. Democrats have used overall job counts to argue the employment situation has at least gotten somewhat better under President Barack Obama. In an August 5, 2011 news release, the Democratic National Committee noted that 2.4 million private sector jobs have been created over the past 17 months. The news release noted that the "pace of recovery isn’t fast enough, but 2.4 million families are now better able to make ends meet." Nationwide figures from the BLS show that from February 2010 to July 2011, private sector jobs rose 2.2 percent ending at 109.2 million. The total number of all jobs in the U.S. -- including government positions -- rose 1.5 percent during the same period ending at 131.2 million. Brian Coy, a spokesman for the Virginia Democratic Party, also pointed out that the percentage of the state’s working age population with a job is at the same point it was in February 2010. In February 2010, there were 3,891,279 people in Virginia who were employed, which was 64.3 percent of the state’s working age population of 6,049,306, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. In June 2011, the number of people in Virginia with a job had grown to 3,951,327, but the size of the working age population also rose to 6,141,503. That meant the state still had the same 64.3 percent of its working age population employed. "If you define progress as putting a greater percentage of our population to work (which seems like a fair definition to me), we haven’t made progress since Bob McDonnell took office," Coy said in an e-mail. Terry Rephann, a regional economist with the University of Virginia’s Weldon Cooper Center for Public Service, said the percentage of people with jobs can stay constant even if there’s job creation in a state. A state like Virginia, for example, is a fairly typical southern state where the population is growing faster than in the northern states, he said. As a result, the number of people with jobs has to increase even faster to keep up with that relatively higher rate of population growth, Rephann said. Rephann said that the jobs environment in Virginia has improved a bit since the early part of last year. But Rephann also said that the number of jobs created since McDonnell took office isn’t very impressive. "Even 40,000 in a (state) economy of this size is not really enormous job growth," Rephann said. "But that’s the nature of the economic recovery that we’re in." Virginia’s unemployment rate was at a peak of 7.2 percent at the start of McDonnell’s term. The number has consistently declined, and it was 6 percent in June 2011. The commonwealth’s jobless rate is one third lower than the 9.1 percent national unemployment rate. Virginia is tied with Hawaii and Iowa for the eighth lowest statewide unemployment rate in the country. Virginia’s percentage of working age residents with a job also compares favorably on a national stage. Nationwide, 58.2 percent of the country’s working age population was employed as of June 2011. We’ll also point out, as we often do with these stories, that economists repeatedly tell us governors take too much credit and receive too much blame for short-term performance over their state economies. A governor’s ability to affect brief business cycles is limited, economists say. To sum up: The state Democratic party said there has been "no progress" on creating jobs since McDonnell took office. While the Dems are correct that the percentage of the state’s working age population with a job was the same in June 2011 as it was when McDonnell took office, there is no getting around the fact that the state added 48,200 jobs. Or that the unemployment rate has dropped during his term. That it contradicts the Democrats’ blanket assertion that there has been no progress. We rate the claim False.

pomt-05161	Barack Obama has "provided guns to Mexican drug cartels."	half-true	/texas/statements/2012/jun/18/rick-perry/rick-perry-says-obama/	Addressing the Republican Party of Texas convention, Gov. Rick Perry said the country erred in 2008 by electing the wrong person as president. "Three and a half years, and nearly 100 rounds of golf into his presidency, Barack Obama has exploded the federal debt, passed a failed, budget-busting stimulus package, socialized health care, and provided guns to Mexican drug cartels," Perry said June 7, 2012. "Admit it, America -- 2008 was our national ‘oops’ moment!" We recently confirmed Obama had played nearly 100 rounds of golf as president. And PolitiFact reporters have previously explored claims about the debt, the success of the stimulus package and whether the 2010 Patient Protection and Affordable Health Care Act amounts to socialized health care. Perry’s claim that Obama "provided guns to Mexican drug cartels" struck us as novel. Is it correct? Perry spokeswoman Catherine Frazier told us by email that Perry was referring to the botched federal gun trafficking investigation on the U.S.-Mexico border known as Fast and Furious in which federal agents lost track of hundreds of firearms they were letting flow into Mexico from Arizona as part of an effort to build cases against Mexican drug cartels. The multi-agency federal arms-trafficking investigation took place from late 2009 to early 2011 -- during Obama’s presidency -- under the Phoenix office of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, an agency of the Justice Department. In the operation, agents purposely allowed weapons to be illegally purchased and circulated on both sides of the U.S.-Mexico border, as the Los Angeles Times said in a Dec. 8, 2011, news story. Two of the weapons turned up after a U.S. Border Patrol agent was killed in southern Arizona, the paper said, though for a January 2012 fact check, we found no information supporting a claim that ballistics tests confirmed that the found weapons killed the agent. The Times said scores of other guns in the operation were reportedly used in violent crimes in Mexico, adding: "While the aim of Fast and Furious was to track weapons, instead it ended up significantly arming the Mexican drug cartels." And did Obama have a hand in the endeavor? We looked for indications. In a March 22, 2011, interview with Univision, posted online by CBS News, Obama said neither he nor Attorney General Eric Holder authorized Fast and Furious and pointed out that the operation was under internal investigation. "We don’t have all the facts," Obama said. Asked if he was informed about the operation, Obama replied: "Absolutely not. This is a pretty big government, the United States government. I’ve got a lot of moving parts." He added: "Our policy is to ramp up the interdiction" or capture "of guns flowing south, because that’s contributing to some of the security problems that are taking place in Mexico." In an interview the same day with CNN Español and an October 2011 interview with ABC News, Obama said he learned of Fast and Furious from news reports. He further said to CNN: "We have to make sure that we are interdicting the flow of guns and cash to the south. It's not enough just to interdict drugs flowing north. And so, we've actually initiated a whole range of measures to make sure that we're reducing that southbound flow." Noting that Holder had launched the internal investigation into Fast and Furious, Obama told ABC "it is not acceptable for us to allow guns to go into Mexico... So it's very upsetting to me to think that somebody showed such bad judgment that they would allow something like that to happen and we will find out who and what happened in this situation and make sure it gets corrected." We looked for other signs of Obama’s role in the operation, finding nothing to contradict his accounts. In 2011, staff to the House Committee on Oversight & Government Reform, chaired by Rep. Darrell Issa, R-California, issued two Fast and Furious reports. The June 14, 2011, report covers Fast and Furious accounts of ATF agents. The July 26, 2011, report explores the impact of Fast and Furious on Mexico. The reports do not gauge Obama’s involvement. A January 2012 report by House Democrats says the strategy of permitting illegal guns to flow to cartels in Mexico in hopes of building cases against vital figures originated with federal law officers in Arizona in 2006, which was when George W. Bush was president. "Unfortunately, this strategy failed to include sufficient operational controls to stop these dangerous weapons from getting into the hands of violent criminals, creating a danger to public safety on both sides of the border," Rep. Elijah Cummings, D-Maryland, told colleagues in a Jan. 30, 2012, letter summarizing the report. His letter says Fast and Furious was the fourth federal operation since 2006 in which gun-walking occurred. Finally, we reached the office of Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, who has been critical of Fast and Furious. Grassley spokeswoman Jill Gerber provided a partially redacted document that appears to be a Jan. 8, 2010, briefing paper on Fast and Furious originated by federal authorities based in Arizona. Its bullet point No. 13 opens: "Currently our strategy is to allow the transfer of firearms to continue to take place, albeit at a much slower pace, in order to further the investigation and allow for the identification of additional co-conspirators who would continue to operate and illegally traffic" firearms to Mexican drug trafficking organizations "perpetrating armed violence along the Southwest Border." Informed of Perry’s statement, Gerber said by email: "It’s more accurate and complete to say the ‘Obama administration’ provided guns to Mexican drug cartels rather than" to "say President Obama himself did so." Our ruling Fast and Furious, intended to send guns to Mexican drug cartels toward building cases against key figures, took place on Obama’s watch. However, unlike the other results bemoaned by Perry at the convention -- growth in the federal debt and the passage of Obamacare and the stimulus -- we see no indication Obama had an influential role in the border operation. That is, there is no sign that Obama either initiated or approved the deliberate flow of guns to cartels. We rate Perry's claim as Half True.

pomt-04685	Says Charlie Crist "was pro-life, pro-gun and vehemently anti-tax."	mostly true	/florida/statements/2012/sep/06/george-lemieux/charlie-crist-was-pro-life-pro-gun-and-anti-tax-sa/	After former Florida Gov. Charlie Crist endorsed President Barack Obama and secured a speaking spot at the Democratic National Convention, Republicans pulled out the Crist files to highlight how much the Republican-turned-independent Crist had changed in just four years. George LeMieux, a Republican and a former Crist chief of staff, wrote a biting op-ed about Crist’s former stances. "He never met a tax increase he liked. ... The Charlie Crist I knew idolized Ronald Reagan and embraced Reagan's view of limited government. He was pro-life, pro-gun and vehemently anti-tax. He believed big government was the enemy of success, and that when government taxed it took ‘your money.’" In this fact-check we will explore whether Crist was "pro-life, pro-gun and vehemently anti-tax." First, we will note what Crist said of himself in February 2010: "I am pro-life, I’m pro-gun, I’m pro-family and I’m anti-tax. And I always have been." He made those claims at a Christian Family Coalition breakfast while running for U.S. Senate as a Republican. He would ditch the GOP label for no-party about two months later as he was struggling in his primary bid against Marco Rubio. "Pro-life" Crist’s stance on abortion over his political career is too complex to boil down to a sound bite -- even if Crist tried to do that himself at times. When he was running for the U.S. Senate in 1998, Crist said in a questionnaire for the Tampa Bay Times that he was pro-choice, but not pro-abortion. "I believe that a woman has the right to choose, but would prefer only after careful consideration and consultation with her family, her physician and her clergy; not her government," he said. Crist said in a debate during that campaign that he would not support a constitutional ban on abortion. In 2006, when he was running for governor, Crist said he was pro-life. But he would not support repealing Roe vs. Wade and opposed a 24-hour waiting period. "I don't think that politicians ought to put themselves in the place of physicians, and I think it's very important to respect the medical profession," said Crist, whose father is a doctor. In 2010, as a Republican U.S. Senate candidate, Crist said he would "fight for pro-life legislative efforts." But later in 2010, after leaving the Republican Party, Crist vetoed a bill that would have required women seeking abortions to get an ultrasound. He said he found the requirement that women pay for the procedure "punitive" and that the measure was "almost mean spirited." "Pro-gun" When Crist was running for U.S. Senate in 2010, we reviewed a claim that he "never wavered in his support of the Second Amendment, the right to bear arms." We ruled that claim True and will briefly review what we found for that article. In one of his first high-profile gun battles, then-state senator Crist blasted Gov. Lawton Chiles' last-minute effort to require criminal background checks and a waiting period for purchases made at gun shows in 1998. The legislation proposal died. As attorney general, Crist nominated Marion P. Hammer, former president of the National Rifle Association, to the Florida Women's Hall of Fame, and she was inducted in 2004. Hammer is also the longtime president of the state’s NRA affiliate Unified Sportsmen of Florida. In his 2006 primary against Republican rival Tom Gallagher, Crist ran an ad calling Gallagher "anti-gun" and highlighting Crist’s endorsement from the NRA. As governor, Crist signed into law legislation that allowed 500,000 concealed weapons permit-holders to bring their guns to work as long as the weapons remained in their vehicles. "Anti-tax" To examine Crist’s actions about taxes, we reviewed multiple reports from Florida TaxWatch and newspaper articles. We also interviewed staff at Florida TaxWatch as well as Amy Baker, the state’s chief economist. Here are some highlights from his tenure as governor: 2007: Crist repeatedly promised Floridians that their taxes would "drop like a rock." Crist and the Legislature attempted to deliver that through a question put to voters, Amendment 1, which increased the homestead property tax exemption. Voters approved it in January 2008. Kurt Wenner, vice president of tax research at Florida TaxWatch, said that taxes didn’t really drop like a rock but "there was some reduction in them." But much of that happened due to the decline in property values. In his first proposed budget in 2007, Crist called for continuing sales tax holidays and reducing the communications services tax. 2008: Crist’s budget proposal suggested dealing with a drop in revenues by using reserves and trust funds. He recommended two more sales tax holidays, one for hurricane preparedness and one for back-to-school, a savings to taxpayers of $36 million. 2009: Crist’s budget didn’t call for general tax hikes, but he did ultimately support a $1 a pack cigarette tax hike and surcharge on other tobacco products. That tax hike added up to about $1 billion a year, said Dominic Calabro, president of Florida TaxWatch. Crist also signed a budget that included new fees including a package of increased and new Highway Safety Fees for about $1 billion in recurring dollars. The Miami Herald quoted Crist as saying: "The cigarette tax is appropriate and I really view it more as a health issue than I do as a tax issue.'' If Crist had vetoed the cigarette tax, the state would have lost nearly $2 billion in federal Medicaid matching funds. The Tampa Bay Times wrote that Crist would call taxes the "T-word" as if it was an obscenity but would warm up if called a "user fee." 2010: TaxWatch wrote that Crist’s budget proposal in January 2010 called for $2.7 billion in increased spending and $100 million in tax cuts by relying on federal money, Seminole gambling Compact and raiding trust funds. Calabro said that Crist could have done more to reign in spending during his tenure. But Wenner said that "generally throughout his career (Crist) was in favor of reducing taxes for the average Floridian." Our ruling LeMieux said that Gov. Charlie Crist "was pro-life, pro-gun and vehemently anti-tax." Crist did describe himself in similar language in 2010 while he was still a Republican and running for U.S. Senate. And we agree that he was consistently for gun rights. His record on abortion was more mixed. At different times, he called himself "pro-life" and he called himself "pro-choice." And even when he called himself "pro-life" in 2006, he said he would not support overturning Roe vs. Wade. In 2010, he earned cheers from abortion rights supporters when he vetoed a bill that would force women who are getting abortions to undergo an ultrasound. Crist portrayed himself as anti-tax and generally avoided tax increases, although he did support the cigarette tax hike and other increases in fees. On the whole, we rate this claim Mostly True.

pomt-00344	Says Leah Vukmir was "just about the only legislator who stood with the insurance companies" and "voted against oral chemotherapy."	mostly true	/wisconsin/statements/2018/sep/14/tammy-baldwin/insurers-leah-vukmir-opposed-wisconsin-law-forcing/	A TV ad by U.S. Sen. Tammy Baldwin attacks Leah Vukmir, her Republican rival in the Nov. 6, 2018, election, over oral chemotherapy and insurance companies. The ad from the Wisconsin Democrat, unveiled Sept. 10, 2018, features a Manitowoc woman who says: I’m 44 and I just finished my last chemo for a brain tumor. It was oral chemo, the only chemo for my kind of cancer. So, I’m glad that Republicans and Democrats made the insurance companies in Wisconsin cover oral chemo. Who would say no to that? Leah Vukmir. She was just about the only legislator who stood with the insurance companies instead of the people. Leah Vukmir, you ought to be ashamed. At one point, a photo of Vukmir is shown with these words on the screen: "Voted against oral chemotherapy." The references are to votes by Vukmir, who is a state senator, on a bill that was later signed into law. Let’s see if Vukmir was "just about the only legislator who stood with the insurance companies" and "voted against oral chemotherapy." All our fact checks in the U.S. Senate race. The law The law, signed by Republican Gov. Scott Walker in April 2014, makes it easy for cancer patients to afford oral chemotherapy, such as the pills the woman in the ad took. It prohibits health insurance plans from charging higher copayments, deductibles or coinsurance for oral chemotherapy than they do for injected or intravenous chemotherapy. Before the law, health plans typically covered oral chemotherapy under prescription drug plans that could have high copays; for some health plans, those copays could run into many thousands of dollars. In contrast, chemotherapy administered at a hospital or clinic was covered as part of a health plan's standard medical coverage — with no additional cost to the patient after the deductible was reached. Like us on Facebook. Follow us on Twitter: @PolitiFactWisc. Vukmir’s votes Vukmir was one of two Republican senators to come out vocally against the bill and in support of insurers. She said at the time: "I have a consistent record of opposing insurance mandates. A state mandate would only impact the insurance companies regulated by Wisconsin and not those regulated at the federal level, creating an uneven playing field and driving up costs for consumers." The bill was opposed by the Wisconsin Association of Health Plans, an HMO trade group, as well as another trade group, the Alliance of Health Insurers, and individual insurers. Insurers said the measure would drive up costs on insurance premiums and make it harder for employers and consumers to afford coverage. When the measure came to a vote in the Senate, Vukmir and GOP Sen. Paul Farrow cast the only no votes. The measure passed, 30-2. After changes were made to the bill in the Assembly, the Senate approved the bill again, 26-7. Vukmir again voted no because of her opposition to putting mandates on insurers; the other six senators said the changes weakened the bill. So, Vukmir was nearly alone in her opposition to an oral chemotherapy bill that was opposed by insurance companies. Her campaign told us that "when government mandates price structures, providers eliminate coverage options and fewer people end up with quality care." But to be clear, her vote wasn’t against oral chemotherapy, per se. Rather, the law requires that insurers treat oral chemotherapy like traditional chemotherapy when it comes to how much patients must pay. Our rating Baldwin says Vukmir was "just about the only legislator who stood with the insurance companies" and "voted against oral chemotherapy." On the main vote on a chemotherapy bill, Vukmir aligned with insurance companies that opposed the bill and was one of two state senators to vote no. That said, Vukmir’s vote wasn’t against oral chemotherapy. It was against stopping insurers from charging patients higher deductibles, copayments or coinsurance for oral chemotherapy than they would pay for traditional chemotherapy. For a statement that is accurate but needs clarification, our rating is Mostly True. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com	None	Tammy Baldwin	None	None	None	2018-09-14T12:52:55	2018-09-10	['None']
pomt-10107	On which team he's rooting for in the World Series.	half flip	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/oct/21/barack-obama/almost-a-phanatic/	In one of most biting attacks this political season, Sen. John McCain accused Sen. Barack Obama of pandering to his audience by flip-flopping on his rooting interest in the World Series. On Oct. 21, 2008, in Bensalem, Pa., solid Philadelphia Phillies territory, McCain told a small audience, "Now, I’m not dumb enough to get mixed up in a World Series between swing states. But I think I may have detected a little pattern with Sen. Obama. It’s pretty simple really. When he’s campaigning in Philadelphia, he roots for the Phillies, and when he’s campaigning in Tampa Bay, he ‘shows love’ to the Rays." There’s nothing so ugly as a flip-flopper on sports team loyalties. So we better get to the bottom of this. Here’s the facts: Obama in Dunedin, Fla., on Sept. 24, prior to the postseason: "Congrats for the Rays. But I’m a White Sox fan, and we’ll see you in the playoffs." Obama in Philadelphia, on Oct. 11, after the upstart Rays took out his White Sox in the first round of the American League playoffs: "I am a White Sox fan. But since the White Sox are out of it, I’ll root for the Phillies now." Obama in Tampa, Fla., on Oct. 20. Fresh off their ALCS win over the Boston Red Sox, a small group of the Rays attend Obama's rally and rookie pitcher David Price introduced the nominee. Said Obama: "I’ve said from the beginning that I am a unity candidate, bringing people together. So when you see a White Sox fan showing love to the Rays — and the Rays showing some love back — you know we are on to something right here." Obama also joked that he had considered getting a mohawk as a show of solidarity with the Rays (that’s what hard-core Rays fans do these days). "But my political advisers said they weren’t sure how that would play with swing voters," Obama said. In the days before the Internet, it may have been possible to get away with pandering to sports enthusiasts in competing towns. No longer. Bloggers quickly pounced when Republican vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin told a New Hampshire audience that "Red Sox fans know how to turn an underdog into a victor." The previous week, Palin sought to connect with a Tampa Bay crowd using nearly the same line. "How about those Tampa Bay Rays?" Palin said. "You know what that tells me? It tells me that the people in this area know a little something about turning an underdog into a victor." Insert groan here. But Obama’s the one on the hot seat here. At no time has Obama wavered in his primary allegiance to the White Sox. Any movement on that front would be inexcusable. But his team is gone, and now whom is he pulling for? A statement released by Obama campaign spokesman Tommy Vietor, quoted on a New York Times politics blog, sought to make things clear. "Senator Obama said he’s rooting for the Phillies. Yesterday he said nice things about the members of the team who came out to support him, but that doesn’t change the fact that Tampa Bay bounced his White Sox out of the playoffs." In the complex hierarchy of determining fan loyalty, we are left to weigh whether "showing love" for the Rays equates to "rooting for" the Phillies. No, these aren't equivalent. But if you're rooting for the Phillies, you sure don't show love for the Rays at a Tampa rally. Is it shameless pandering? Of course. But is it a flip-flop? Not quite. We call it Half Flip.

pomt-08171	Low-flow toilets "can cost homeowners up to $1,000 each."	half-true	/georgia/statements/2010/dec/01/elaine-boyer/dekalb-commissioner-says-low-flow-toilets-can-be-c/	Thanks to The Dunwoody Crier, the minds of your AJC PolitiFact Georgia scribes are in the toilet. An op-ed by DeKalb County Commissioner Elaine Boyer derided what she called "the toilet tax," which was passed in response to the region's drought. "Two years ago, the commission unnecessarily started mandating that low-flush toilets had to be installed in older homes for sales to get to the closing table," Boyer wrote in the Oct. 27 issue. "Those toilets can cost homeowners up to $1,000 each." Toilets? For $1,000? We were, ahem, bowled over. Does a commode really cost that much? We researched the ordinance and called plumbers to find out. A 2008 DeKalb ordinance requires that newly purchased buildings have low-flow toilets and other water-saving fixtures installed before the county turns on water service. The ordinance applies to residential and commercial properties built before Jan. 1, 1993, in the county's unincorporated areas. The Department of Watershed Management performs free inspections to certify a building is compliant. Buildings that will be torn down, foreclosed, or transferred between spouses or from a parent to a child are exempt. If the switch costs more than $1,000 per toilet for a residential property, you can get a financial hardship waiver. DeKalb County offers a rebate program to defray the cost. Water customers can purchase from a list of eligible toilets and receive up to $100. After a quick search, AJC PolitiFact Georgia found a $160 toilet on the online list. A Boyer spokeswoman emphasized the toilet ordinance was not the main focus of the commissioner's article. Her target was DeKalb's recently instituted foreclosure registry, which requires banks and other owners of foreclosed homes to register them online. She tried to tank the proposal, but it passed in July. The spokeswoman also referred us to Robert Broome, a lobbyist with the Atlanta Board of Realtors. Broome told us that the group supports water conservation but opposes DeKalb's rule because it ties the installation of those fixtures to real estate transactions. The change can be expensive, Broome said. He's been told of cases where homeowners have had to rip up dry wall or old plumbing to comply. Broadly speaking, toilets can cost just about anything. Consider the porcelain throne of rock royalty John Lennon. It sold in an August auction for about $15,000. Lee Krinsky, general manager of Plumb Works Inc. in Atlanta, recalled a toilet that cost $13,000, excluding the $1,000 seat. It was hand-painted with a floral design. The seat, which was inlaid with gold, was fashioned in the shape of a seashell. A more typical low-flow toilet can range from $500 to $800, Krinsky said. This includes the cost of purchasing the toilet, picking it up from the supplier, installing it, and hauling the old one away. If installation goes smoothly, and most do, a plumber can be in and out of the bathroom in an hour-and-a-half, Krinsky said. Given the high cost of water, the toilet will easily pay for itself. For another opinion, we talked to Ellen Whitaker, executive director of the Plumbing and Mechanical Association of Georgia. The trade organization once opposed low-flow ordinances but switched positions after the drought. Plumbers in Whitaker's group were reluctant to give a price range for the job. Variables such as the condition of the old toilet and plumbing can make it hard to predict, she said. Consider the toilet flange, Whitaker said. The ring connects the toilet to a drain pipe and stops smells from seeping up through the commode. If the flange is stuck in place, a plumber might spend extra hours removing it. This means $1,000 "can be a good price," Whitaker said. Of course, you could install the toilet yourself. If you purchased that $160 toilet we found online, hauled it home yourself, got the $100 rebate, and encountered no unusual problems, your grand total would be $60, plus tax. A low-flow toilet can cost as little as dinner and a movie or as much as a Toyota Corolla. The cost of professional installation varies, but can often fall in the $500 to $800 range. Do-it-yourselfers can spend less than $100, thanks to DeKalb's rebate program. If the job costs more than $1,000, you can get a waiver. Very strictly speaking, Boyer's right. Installing a low-flow toilet "can" cost up to $1,000. But in many cases, it will cost much less. Boyer's claim could have used more explanation and context, but much of it holds water. We therefore rule it Half True.	None	Elaine Boyer	None	None	None	2010-12-01T06:00:00	2010-10-27	['None']
pomt-02204	"Americans will spend more on taxes in 2014 than they will on food, clothing and housing combined."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2014/apr/23/tax-foundation/do-americans-pay-more-taxes-food-clothing-and-hous/	With the April 15 tax deadline a fresh memory, Americans have seen an uptick in social media posts about taxes. One reader saw a Facebook post and forwarded it to us, asking whether it was accurate. "Americans will spend more on taxes in 2014 than they will on food, clothing and housing combined," the post said, and it included a chart showing that the combination of state, local and federal taxes exceeded the amount spent on food, clothing and housing. The post was credited to the Tax Foundation, a think tank that generally has a pro-business leaning. The claim sounded familiar to us -- in 2011, we checked a statement by Republican National Committee chairman Reince Priebus that "Americans will pay more in taxes in 2011 than they will spend on groceries, clothing and shelter combined." We rated that claim Half True. Experts told us that our previous analysis was generally applicable to the new claim as well, but it’s been three years since we checked it -- and the claim is still circulating on social media -- we thought it would be worth taking a second crack at it. First, we’ll note that no one knows for sure how Americans will allocate their money in 2014, since more than half the year hasn’t happened yet. The best we can do is extrapolate from previous years. Given the data available, the last year for which we can do it fully is 2013. We began our analysis by measuring expenditures on groceries, clothing and shelter. For this, we turned to the same source the Tax Foundation did -- the Bureau of Economic Analysis, an office within the U.S. Commerce Department. In a data series known as National Income and Product Accounts, the bureau tracks how Americans spend their income. For 2013, Americans spent more than $884 billion on food and beverages consumed at home, and an additional $737 billion on restaurant meals and beverages. For clothing, the figure was $363 billion, and for housing and utilities, it was $2.083 trillion. Total expenditures: $4.067 trillion. For taxes paid, we also turned to the Bureau of Economic Analysis. The amount of federal taxes collected in 2013 was $3.041 trillion, and the amount of state and local taxes collected in 2013 (minus transfer payments from the federal government to the states) was $1.54 trillion. Combined, that’s $4.581 trillion. This makes the Tax Foundation correct in saying that the aggregate amount of taxes paid exceeds the aggregate amount spent on food, clothing and housing. It’s possible to quibble with both sides of this comparison -- the tax figure includes corporate taxes, while the expenditures side includes such items as alcoholic beverages -- but generally speaking, the tax figure is modestly higher than the expenditures on food, clothing and housing, giving the claim a solid grounding in the numbers. (We should note that taking out corporate taxes doesn't make much of a difference; taxes on individuals alone would still outstrip the other category.) This is not the only way to calculate it, however. While the Tax Foundation’s method shows that Americans as a whole pay more for taxes than for food, clothing and shelter, there are wide variations in what individual Americans pay. According to the Bureau of Economic Analysis, taxpayers in the aggregate spent 3.2 percent of their consumption on clothing, 14.1 percent on groceries and restaurants, and 18.1 percent on housing and utilities. Combined, that’s a little over 35 percent of individual income. Because our tax system is progressive, people with lower incomes typically don’t pay 35 percent of their income in taxes. According to the Urban Institute-Brookings Institution Tax Policy Center, American households earning under $200,000 a year don’t pay more than 20 percent of their cash income in federal taxes. The rate rises to 31 percent for those earning more than $1 million a year. Once you add in state and local taxes, Americans $200,000 and up may well see 35 percent or more of their income going to taxes, depending on the state and locality where they live. But for those near the bottom of the income scale, the tax burden is much lower. The federal tax burden doesn’t hit double digits until $30,000 in household income, and for those earning between $75,000 and $100,000, the rate is a bit over 17 percent. Even adding in state and local taxes, most taxpayers in these categories are not going to be paying 35 percent of their income in taxes. And remember that there are two parts to this equation. While Americans on average pay 35 percent of their income for food, clothing and housing, some pay more than that, and some pay less. We couldn’t find statistics on consumption patterns for different income classes. But generally speaking, the poorer you are, the higher a share of your income you’ll pay for these basics of life, and the richer you are, the smaller a share of your income will go to food, clothing and housing. So richer Americans may well pay 35 percent of their income in taxes even as they pay a much smaller fraction on food, clothing and housing. For these people, the Tax Foundation’s claim is correct. But poorer Americans will tend to pay a far higher share of their income for food, clothing and housing, and they won’t pay very much in taxes. For them, the foundation’s claim isn’t true in many cases. It’s hard to say whether the Tax Foundation’s claim is true more often than not, but there’s reason to think it may not be true in most cases. That’s because, according to the Tax Policy Center, upper-income groups account for a smaller share of the population. Households earning $114,484 or more -- a group that includes households most likely to pay more in taxes than in the three basic necessities -- account for just one-fifth of the population. By contrast, households earning less than $66,998 -- which include many households that will pay more for the necessities than for taxes -- account for 60 percent of the population. This doesn’t mean that the Tax Foundation calculation doesn’t have value. "We are very clear that America as a whole -- not the average American -- pays more in taxes than food, clothing, and housing combined," said Tax Foundation economist Kyle Pomerleau. "We are giving Americans a vivid illustration of what the total cost of government is. We hope taxpayers ask: Are the services we receive as a nation worth $4.5 trillion." Still, Roberton Williams, a fellow at the Tax Policy Center, said the numbers should be taken with a big grain of salt. "I don't doubt the aggregate numbers cited, but those numbers say little about what happens to particular people," Williams said. Our ruling The Tax Foundation post said that "Americans will spend more on taxes in 2014 than they will on food, clothing and housing combined." While a minority of Americans probably does pay more for taxes, the numbers suggest that there are many more Americans whose food, clothing and shelter expenses exceed their tax burden.

pomt-00376	"Every state that has put in a graduated income tax, the middle class always pays more."	false	/illinois/statements/2018/sep/09/bruce-rauner/rauner-falsely-claims-graduated-income-taxes-alway/	A recurring theme of Republican Gov. Bruce Rauner’s re-election campaign is to paint Democratic challenger J.B. Pritzker as a big taxer. To that end, Rauner has seized on Pritzker’s advocacy for replacing Illinois’ current flat-rate income tax with a graduated system used by most states and the federal government that imposes higher rates on those with higher income. Pritzker, however, has been vague about what sort of rates he would like to set, and that has given Rauner a big opening to try to fill in the blanks. During a recent radio interview with the Bloomington-Normal based WJBC-AM, Rauner claimed Pritzker was being cagey because middle class voters were bound to get hammered by any switch. "The truth is, every state that has put in a graduated income tax, the middle class always pays more," Rauner said, echoing what’s become a frequent talking point. "That’s what Pritzker doesn’t want known, that’s the truth and we’ve got to get the truth out." Last fall, we rated Mostly False a claim from Rauner that the graduated system Pritzker supports would necessarily result in a tax hike on Illinois’ middle class. Because Pritzker has so far refused to propose rates, no one can say for sure whether the plan he might ultimately unveil would be worse or better for middle-income taxpayers. But Rauner’s recent claim paints the issue with an even broader brush, flatly declaring it "the truth" that all 32 states that tax income at graduated rates penalize the middle class. That’s a tall order, so we decided to see if we could find "the truth" about Rauner’s "truth." Rauner wrong on rates In Illinois, the rich as well as the not-so-rich all pay the same 4.95 percent tax rate on their income. We asked Rauner spokesman Justin Giorgio to explain how middle-class taxpayers are worse off in all states with graduated taxes, and he sent us a list of 26 states in which a single filer making $59,000 would be taxed at a higher rate than the one currently in effect in Illinois. There are glaring problems with that response. Giorgio’s list omits six states with graduated taxes where such a taxpayer would pay less even though Rauner was adamant that his claim applied to all such states. Then there’s the question of that $59,000 benchmark, which is what the U.S. Census pegged as the median household income in the nation for 2016, the latest year for which such data is available. The household number is typically an aggregate of the incomes of two or more wage earners living under the same roof — not individuals. In 2016, the Census measured the median income for the category of people that most closely approximates single filers at slightly more than $35,700. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com Setting aside the Rauner camp’s sloppy metrics — not to mention the lack of any consensus definition for the middle class — we looked up the tax impact in each of those 32 graduated tax states when applied to that hypothetical single filer making the national median $35,700. Under that scenario, the number of states that would tax her income at lower rates than in Illinois grows from six to 11. In several of those graduated tax states, the rate advantage over Illinois would be substantial. In North Dakota, for instance, her income would be taxed at just over 1 percent. Overall tax burdens Comparing tax policies between the states is fraught with complications because no two do it alike. But the Rauner camp doesn’t just compare apples to oranges. More like apples to an entire fruit basket. Rates alone don’t necessarily tell us who pays more. Many graduated tax states do indeed impose rates for most income brackets above Illinois’ single rate. But that doesn’t always mean an individual’s tax burden will be higher there. At a different campaign event on the same day as his radio appearance, Rauner pointed to four graduated tax states with what he described as "stunningly high" rates: Minnesota, New Jersey, New York and Connecticut. What he failed to point out, however, is that several of those states also offer a generous menu of exemptions and deductions that significantly mitigate costs for middle- and low-income taxpayers. Individual taxpayers in Connecticut earning over $10,000, for instance, are faced with nominal tax rates higher than Illinois’ flat one. But a single filer in Connecticut also receives a personal exemption worth seven times more than that offered in Illinois. And in New York, rates higher than Illinois’ set in on every dollar earned by an individual above $11,700. But the standard deduction is worth four times the $2,175 personal exemption in Illinois, which does not have a standard deduction. It’s important to note that a multi-rate structure doesn’t necessarily guarantee a state’s income tax will be exceptionally progressive. Missouri, for example, has a ten-tiered rate structure but the highest rate kicks in after just $9,072 in income. That said, Missouri taxpayers also benefit from a standard deduction even more generous than that in New York. And because graduated systems impose tax rates in escalating steps on different portions of income, people in those states aren’t paying top rates on every dollar they earn. In Iowa, for instance, that means taxpayers still get to pay lower rates than they would in Illinois on their first $14,382 of income, regardless of how much they earn beyond that. Graduated rates, by their very nature, are designed so lower-income earners pay less on a greater share of their income. "It doesn’t take a tax policy analyst to say that you could create an income tax with rates both below and above [4.95 percent] at different levels of income and that the majority of middle-income taxpayers would pay less as a result of that," said Richard Auxier, a research associate with the Tax Policy Center, a joint venture of the Urban Institute and Brookings Institution. "To argue that going to a progressive income tax is bad for low- and middle-income families is kind of missing the point of why you would have a progressive rate structure in the first place," he added. Our ruling Rauner said that in "every state that has put in a graduated income tax, the middle class always pays more." But 11 of the 32 states that tax income at graduated rates would tax an individual earning the national median at lower rates than Illinois. In some of those states, the rate would be significantly lower. What’s more, tax rates tell only part of the story. Many states, including some with much higher rates, also offer taxpayers generous exemptions and deductions, significantly reducing their actual tax burden. Rauner’s claim that graduated systems inevitably lead to higher taxes on the middle class is not even close to accurate. We rate it False.

pomt-01926	"The government -- not the armed forces -- is stockpiling hundreds of millions of rounds of ammunition for domestic use."	false	/oregon/statements/2014/jun/27/james-buchal/government-stockpiling-hundreds-millions-rounds-am/	Do Americans need to worry about the government stockpiling ammunition and assault rifles to quell coming uprisings? A number of political bloggers think so. A slew of chain emails and articles on conservative-leaning websites going back a year or more claim that the government’s stockpile of ammunition reaches into the billions of rounds. The claim: James Buchal, an Oregon Republican challenging Rep. Earl Blumenauer, D-Ore., clearly has concerns. His campaign website includes a photograph of an ominous-looking armored vehicle below copy in which Buchal says part of his campaign will "focus on raising awareness of the threat to America’s future posed by an out-of-control total surveillance state." He adds, "The government -- and not the armed forces -- is stockpiling hundreds of millions of rounds of ammunition for domestic use." Is the government stockpiling that much ammunition? PolitiFact Oregon checked. The analysis: We emailed Buchal, who pointed to a Government Accountability Office report released Feb. 12, 2014. The report, "Ammunition Purchases Have Declined Since 2009," was produced in response to questions from U.S. Sen. Tom Coburn, R-Okla. In a letter dated Nov. 13, 2012, Coburn wrote to Janet Napolitano, then the head of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security: "It has been reported that DHS has recently purchased large amounts of ammunition, as much or more than 1 billion rounds according to some estimates." Some claims put the figure at 1.6 billion rounds. Another set had it at 2.7 billion. Still others fretted about the alleged retrofitting of more than 2,700 heavily armored military vehicles that were going to be turned over to domestic police forces. The GAO report found that as of October 2013, DHS had about 159 million rounds -- enough to meet the training and operational needs of its firearm-carrying personnel for about 22 months, it said. The agency has more than 70,000 armed personnel, the most of any federal agency, according to the report. The Department of Justice is second with 69,000 armed personnel. The DOJ reported its ammunition inventory as enough to last from 13 to 20 months. The report did not translate that to specific figures but provided other information that enabled it to calculate a range of about 90 million to about 138 million rounds. Together, those two agencies represent 80 percent of federal armed personnel, and together they have roughly 250 million to 300 million rounds of ammunition on hand. That may be on the low end of the figure that pops to mind when someone says "hundreds of millions," but Buchal’s claim is accurate on the amount of ammunition the government has on hand. Then we looked at the thrust of Buchal’s claim, that the government is "stockpiling" the ammunition for some later use. DHS’s 159 million inventory in October was down from 178 million rounds in April 2013 and 193 million in November 2012, the GAO report found. We emailed DHS’s press office, which provided a statement saying DHS purchases dropped to 93 million rounds in fiscal 2012 and are projected at 75 million for fiscal 2014. Further, the GAO reported that DHS’ use of ammunition over the past six years has roughly equaled the amount it bought. In 2009, the agency bought 133 million rounds and dipped into reserves to use a total of 141 rounds. In 2013, the agency used 89 million rounds compared with new purchases of 84 million rounds. The report noted that DOJ purchasing trends and usage rates are similar. It also said DOJ’s inventories are below DHS’s. How is the ammunition used? The report noted that new federal officers go through 2,000 to 5,000 rounds a year, most of that in training and certification programs. Experienced officers use about 600 rounds a year. The email from DHS concluded, "Although a small reserve in terms of the overall ammunition is usually kept by the component law enforcement agencies, most do not have the capability to store large amounts of ammunition. There is not an ammunition stockpile." Buchal acknowledged the report’s assertion that purchases have declined but added, "The available information is not sufficient, at least to me, to demonstrate that the levels of ammunition purchases are appropriate." When asked, he did not make a distinction between an "inventory" and a "stockpile." In a final email, Buchal said the distinction may be beside the point. "Bottom line, in all likelihood, the ammunition will only be used for training purposes, but engaging in such broad-scale training is itself a problem," he wrote. "We don’t need SWAT teams to deal with student loan fraud, and training up vast quantities of SWAT teams to deal with such issues is itself a sign of a growing divide between the government and the people." The ruling: On his campaign website, U.S. House candidate James Buchal claims that the government "is stockpiling hundreds of millions of rounds of ammunition for domestic use." A government report indicated that the federal Department of Homeland Security, as of October 2013, had an estimated 159 million rounds in inventory, down from 178 million rounds in April 2013 and 193 million in November 2012. The report also found that DHS and Department of Justice -- which employ 80 percent of the federal government’s armed personnel -- have steadily decreased ammunition purchases since 2009. Projected purchases by DHS for this year will be the lowest in more than five years. Estimated ammunition inventories for both agencies also continue to fall. With inventories and purchases going down, and usage roughly equaling purchases, the government is clearly not "stockpiling" ammunition. And while Buchal is correct in his assertion that the government has "hundreds of millions" of rounds on hand, even he later acknowledged that "in all likelihood," those rounds are being used for training purposes. We rate the claim False. Return to OregonLive.com/politics to comment on this article.	None	James Buchal	None	None	None	2014-06-27T15:22:00	2014-06-16	['None']
pomt-10274	Says McCain once said that on "the most important issues of our day, I've been totally in agreement and support of President Bush."	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/aug/23/joe-biden/thats-what-mccain-said-in-2005/	It didn't take long for Sen. Joe Biden to adopt the Obama campaign talking points linking Sen. John McCain to President Bush. At a rally in Springfield, Ill. celebrating Biden's selection as Sen. Barack Obama's running mate, the Delaware senator offered polite praise of McCain — "He served our country with extraordinary courage and I know he wants to do right by America" — but then criticized McCain for embracing Bush's policies. "And these are John's words, (on) 'the most important issues of our day, I've been totally in agreement and support of President Bush.' Ladies and gentlemen, that's what he said," Biden told the crowd. The quote comes from a June 19, 2005, McCain appearance on NBC's Meet the Press in which host Tim Russert asked the senator about an article in the Arizona Republic that explored how McCain differed from Bush on many issues. "The fact is," Russert said, "you are different than George Bush." "No. No," McCain replied. "The fact is that I'm different, but the fact is that I have agreed with President Bush far more than I have disagreed. And on the transcendent issues, the most important issues of our day, I've been totally in agreement and support of President Bush." McCain continued, "So have we had some disagreements on some issues, the bulk — particularly domestic issues? Yes. But I will argue my conservative record voting with anyone's, and I will also submit that my support for President Bush has been active and very impassioned on issues that are important to the American people. And I'm particularly talking about the war on terror, the war in Iraq, national security, national defense, support of men and women in the military, fiscal discipline, a number of other issues. So I strongly disagree with any assertion that I've been more at odds with the president of the United States than I have been in agreement with him." The interview makes interesting reading today because several of Russert's questions are based on comments from another senator who had just returned from Iraq in June 2005 — Biden. And the interview actually focuses more on McCain's differences with Bush (on issues such as global warming, judicial nominees and stem cell research) than it does on topics they agree about. But Biden is right that McCain said it. We rate his claim True.	None	Joe Biden	None	None	None	2008-08-23T00:00:00	2008-08-23	['George_W._Bush']
pomt-05528	Says the United States "actually exports more gasoline, diesel and other fuels than it imported in 2011 for the first time since, I think, 1949."	true	/new-jersey/statements/2012/apr/11/robert-menendez/robert-menendez-claims-us-oil-exports-surpassed-im/	Drill it in the United States, keep it in the United States. U.S. Sen. Robert Menendez made that argument during his "Twitter Town Hall" on March 28, while noting how the United States exported more fuel products than it imported last year for the first time in more than six decades. "In fact, you know, according to the Energy Department though, the United States – this is something that I found out, I found it pretty amazing – actually exports more gasoline, diesel and other fuels than it imported in 2011 for the first time since, I think, 1949," he said. The Democratic senator later added, "If we keep that here, we can create downward pressures on the prices of gas and diesel, and in doing so, of course help all of our families and help our economy. So I believe drill it in the U.S, keep it in the U.S., and that’s not something that’s happening right now." PolitiFact New Jersey discovered that the senator’s claim is backed up by findings released last month by the U.S. Energy Information Administration, the statistical and analytical agency within the U.S. Department of Energy. According to a March 7 article on the agency’s website, "The United States in 2011 exported more petroleum products, on an annual basis, than it imported for the first time since 1949." Last year, the United States exported nearly 2.9 million barrels per day, surpassing imports by about 440,000 barrels per day, according to the agency. Now, let’s explain what’s fueling this increase in exports. The biggest contributing factor was the increase in foreign purchases of distillate fuel, which includes diesel fuel and heating oil, the agency said. U.S. exports of distillate fuel have been on the rise during the past decade, driven by a global increase in diesel consumption, according to the agency. Between 2006 and 2011, exports of distillate fuel increased by about 297 percent, according to agency data. The growth in distillate fuel exports has been mainly driven by deliveries to the Netherlands -- where many products are later directed to other countries -- as well as to Mexico and Central and South America, the agency has said. The Netherlands was the largest importer in 2011 at 145,000 barrels per day, followed by Mexico with 102,000 barrels per day, according to agency data. The proximity of Mexico, and Central and South America to oil refineries on the U.S. Gulf Coast has contributed to the export growth, according to the agency. Also, Europe requires a certain type of diesel fuel that cannot be produced in many refineries outside the United States, according to the agency. "The primary factor behind the change in Europe has been the switch by light-duty vehicle consumers from gasoline-powered vehicles to diesel-powered vehicles," according to an October 2010 report by federal officials. "The move has been driven by European tax incentives on both vehicles and fuel to encourage the use of more energy-efficient diesel-fueled vehicles." Our ruling During his Twitter Town Hall, Menendez claimed the United States "actually exports more gasoline, diesel and other fuels than it imported in 2011 for the first time since, I think, 1949." Based on findings released last month by the U.S. Energy Information Administration, that statistic is accurate. Driven by demand for distillate fuel -- which includes diesel fuel and heating oil -- exports of petroleum products in 2011 exceeded imports by about 440,000 barrels per day, according to the agency.

pomt-06740	"As we near the 10th anniversary of the 9/11 terrorist attacks, we should not forget that some of the hijackers used New Jersey driver’s licenses to board those aircraft."	false	/new-jersey/statements/2011/aug/28/kevin-otoole/state-sen-kevin-otoole-claims-some-911-hijackers-u/	Nearly 10 years after 19 hijackers took over four flights on the morning of Sept. 11, 2001, state Sen. Kevin O’Toole wants to remind people of what some of those terrorists used to carry out the attacks: a New Jersey driver’s license. O’Toole (R-Essex) provided that history lesson in an Aug. 21 opinion piece in the Times of Trenton about the need for technology upgrades in the state’s Motor Vehicle Commission. A computer failure in July affected commission offices and other state agencies. "Updating the technological capabilities of the MVC is of critical importance and should not be used for political gain," O’Toole wrote. "As we near the 10th anniversary of the 9/11 terrorist attacks, we should not forget that some of the hijackers used New Jersey driver’s licenses to board those aircraft." But PolitiFact New Jersey found that the 9/11 hijackers did not have New Jersey driver’s licenses. According to reports by the FBI and the 9/11 Commission staff, the hijackers had gathered driver’s licenses and state identification cards from five states, but not New Jersey. First, let’s explain the documents cited by O’Toole as the basis for his claim. The senator referred us to 13 documents, including news articles and columns. Two of the documents appear on websites of organizations focused on opposing illegal immigration, and two columns were written by conservative author Phyllis Schlafly. Another document appears on the website for Free Republic, which bills itself as the "Premier Conservative Site on the Net!" The news articles included items published in the New York Times and the Philadelphia Inquirer. The only government document cited by O’Toole was a portion of the 9/11 Commission report, which states "several (hijackers) also obtained new photo identification, first in New Jersey and then at the Virginia Department of Motor Vehicles." But that section only states hijackers obtained "photo identification" in New Jersey, not driver’s licenses. A separate report entitled "9/11 and Terrorist Travel," which was released in August 2004 by the commission’s staff, provides a breakdown of the identification documents of the 9/11 hijackers. According to that report, the hijackers collectively obtained driver’s licenses from Arizona, California and Florida, and state identification cards from Florida, Virginia and Maryland. Those same findings were presented in FBI reports in 2003. Janice Kephart, former counsel to the 9/11 Commission and an author of "9/11 and Terrorist Travel," confirmed to PolitiFact New Jersey that it is wrong to claim any of the hijackers had New Jersey’s driver’s licenses. Kephart suggested the misunderstanding about the driver’s licenses may stem from the fact that some hijackers obtained USA identification cards in New Jersey. A USA identification card does not represent any state or the U.S. government, Kephart said. "They don’t mean anything," Kephart said in a phone interview. "It’s meant to be deceptive." Less than two years before the 9/11 Commission completed its work, the FBI had already debunked the myth about New Jersey driver’s licenses being used on Sept. 11. The story about the licenses became so widely accepted that the administration of former Gov. Jim McGreevey used the claim to boost support for its plans to overhaul the motor vehicle agency. But in December 2002, the FBI said a lengthy investigation found no evidence that any of the hijackers had New Jersey licenses, according to a Star-Ledger article at the time. The McGreevey administration backed off from using the hijackers to tout its proposal. "As a result of the discrepancies raised, we no longer have sufficient confidence to say that there were New Jersey driver’s licenses involved," Eric Shuffler, chief of staff for state Transportation Commissioner Jamie Fox, said at the time. Some of the documents cited by O’Toole were published before the Star-Ledger revealed the results of that FBI investigation -- and before the 9/11 Commission did its job. The ruling In an opinion piece about Motor Vehicle Commission upgrades, O’Toole claimed "some of the hijackers used New Jersey driver’s licenses to board those aircraft." To back up his point, the senator provided various sources, some of which had a conservative bias and/or were published before the 9/11 Commission completed its investigation. But the claim has been refuted by research done by the FBI and the 9/11 Commission. The 9/11 hijackers obtained driver’s licenses and state identification cards from five states, but New Jersey wasn’t one of them. We rate the statement False. To comment on this ruling, go to NJ.com.

pomt-09382	"The spillover violence (from Mexico) in Texas is real and it is escalating."	mostly false	/texas/statements/2010/mar/27/john-cornyn/cornyn-says-spillover-violence-texas-real-and-esca/	After a pregnant American consulate worker and her husband were murdered in Ciudad Juarez this month, the U.S. senators from Texas wrote President Barack Obama urging him to address the "escalating violence" along the state's southern border. "The spillover violence in Texas is real and it is escalating," Sens. Kay Bailey Hutchison and John Cornyn state in a March 17 letter requesting federal attention to the safety of border communities. Spillover violence on the rise in Texas? Do the senators have that right? When a reporter asked for evidence of spillover during a telephone press conference Cornyn hosted on the day the senators' letter went to Obama, Cornyn initially seemed to backpedal. "As far as the Texas border is concerned, to my knowledge, we have not had spillover violence, per se ... I should have said the threat of potential spillover violence," he said. Cornyn continued: "We have had American citizens die in Mexico, and I've been to ... Laredo and visited with families of Americans who have lost loved ones in Nuevo Laredo, some of whom have been kidnapped and others have not been heard from again. And, of course, the latest killings in Juarez raise this specter of security of American citizens who are visiting Mexico." So which is it: real violence or the threat of it? Kevin McLaughlin, Cornyn's spokesman, told us later that Cornyn misspoke during his press conference. McLaughlin said: "There are instances of spillover violence occurring in Texas along the border." McLaughlin sent us nearly 20 news articles and editorials from 1999 into 2010 reporting incidents that could indicate the increasing bloodshed in Mexico is trickling into Texas. For example, Santiago Salinas, a man connected to a Mexican drug cartel was shot and killed in a Houston hotel in 2006. In 2008, a Mexican citizen and a distant relative of Rep. Silvestre Reyes' wife was kidnapped in Juarez and released after her family, who lives in the United States, paid some $32,000 in ransom. In September, Sergio Saucedo, who authorities say was connected to a Mexican drug cartel, was kidnapped at gunpoint from his home in Horizon City in El Paso County. His mutilated body was found in Juarez. In May, a member of the Juarez drug cartel was fatally shot outside his home in El Paso. In January, authorities linked a grenade used in an attack on a bar in Pharr, where three off-duty police officers were, to a drug cartel in Mexico. And in March, two men were kidnapped from the parking lot of a McAllen Wal-Mart and non-fatally shot in connection with a cartel. Last week, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security issued an alert warning El Paso law enforcement that the Barrio Azteca gang in El Paso might retaliate after officers arrested 54 members and associates of the gang the week before. The warning was based on "uncorroborated information" that the gang might authorize its members to murder officers in the El Paso area. Other reminders of violence near the Mexico-Texas border include the sighting of a Mexican military helicopter flying over Zapata County, the Texas Department of Public Safety warning spring-break revelers to avoid Mexican border towns and a recent inflow of Mexicans from El Porvenir seeking political asylum in Fort Hancock after members of a Mexican drug cartel threatened to kill residents and torch their homes. Earlier, in September, the University of Texas at Brownsville and Texas Southmost College closed for several days after stray bullets from a shootout along the Matamoros levee hit a car and building on campus. Last year, 79 Americans were murdered in Mexico, according to the U.S. State Department. From 2003 to 2008, the annual homicide toll ranged from the low 30s to the high 40s. Murders of people in Juarez increased from 1,609 in 2008 to 2,657 in 2009, according to the Texas Department of Safety. This year, more than 550 people have been killed in Juarez. Still, it seems the definition of "spillover violence" may depend on where you're viewing it from. The Congressional Research Service, a nonpartisan agency that provides research analysis to Congress, recently found that no data exists that can definitively answer whether there has been significant spillover violence from Mexico, and anecdotal reports have been mixed. "Currently, U.S. federal officials deny that the recent increase in drug trafficking-related violence in Mexico has resulted in a spillover into the United States, but they acknowledge that the prospect is a serious concern," the service reported Feb. 16. According to the service, the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration defines "spillover violence" as "violence targeted primarily at civilians and government entities — excluding trafficker-on-trafficker violence" though other experts and scholars have recognized such in-fighting as central to spillover, according to the report. Testifying before the U.S. House Appropriations Committee in March 2009, Joseph Arabit, the special agent in charge of the administration's El Paso division, said: "We are all tempted to paint the problem with a very broad brush and react emotionally to violent incidents inside the United States involving Mexican drug traffickers and their victims. But it is crucial, in order to address the problem with the appropriate programs, resources and operations, that we understand the difference between "terrorist" acts — the murder of a U.S. law enforcement agent, or the bombing of a U.S. government building, for example — and actions that are characteristic of violent drug culture, such as the killing of an individual who owes a drug debt to the organization." The Texas Department of Safety defines spillover violence as "Mexican cartel-related violence that occurs in Texas, including aggravated assault, extortion, kidnapping, torture, rape and murder. The victims of these crimes include illegal immigrants being smuggled into the U.S., Mexican or U.S. citizens working with the cartels or their innocent family members, and those who are not associated in any way with the cartels or transnational gangs." Steven McCraw, director of the Texas Department of Safety, said there's "no question" spillover violence is growing in Texas. When we asked McCraw about the federal government's definition of spillover violence, he said: "We don't care how they define it. For obvious reasons, it doesn't matter — it's either a violent act or not a violent act." "We've got ongoing kidnapping investigations, we've got murder investigations, without question, related to cartel activities," he said. The Texas department said it doesn't yet have statistical breakdowns of spillover violence, though McCraw listed 12 incidents since 2008 that the department considers related to Mexican cartels and transnational gangs. Among them: — In February, an illegal immigrant connected to a cartel was found murdered near Mission, at 10 Mile Line and Western Road. The same month, a Mexican Mafia member tried to run over a trooper in Laredo . — In August, border patrol agents near Laredo were pinned down by gunfire across the border, and a U.S. Border Patrol agent was run over by an ATV during a smuggling attempt. — In October 2008, a Donna man was kidnapped and taken to Reynosa, Mexico, where he was killed. Two months earlier, a Weslaco convenience store owner and drug dealer was kidnapped for ransom and taken to Reynosa and then shot, dismembered and burned. Also, the DPS said Adan Mondragon, who Austin police fatally shot after he fired an assault rifle in November 2008, was linked to a Mexican drug-trafficking organization. Still, other published news reports and our interviews with law enforcement officers suggest that officials closest to the border see little evidence of spillover violence. Deputy Sheriff Jesse Tovar of El Paso County told us spillover violence "remains to be seen." Tovar said he considered Saucedo's kidnapping and the El Paso homicide last year two "direct spillover" incidents, but he called that kind of violence "nothing new." "Statistically speaking, the streets are pretty safe," he said, but "there's a war zone going on across the river." With that in mind, Tovar said the sheriff's office has operation plans in place "in case something happens," but declined to elaborate for security reasons. For Terrell County Sheriff William McDonald, so far the only spillover from Mexico has been smugglers, who have been breaking into homes in his jurisdiction more frequently since violence escalated in Juarez. (Terrell County is east of Brewster County, home to Big Bend National Park.) Cliff Harris, sheriff for Pecos County, whose southern border lies about 20 miles north of the border, said that there's a threat of spillover violence but that "so far we haven't seen anything." This month, The Texas Tribune reported that neither Hidalgo County Sheriff Lupe Trevino or Laredo Mayor Raul Salinas were aware of any spillover violence. Monica Weifberg-Stewart, a retailer from McAllen and chair of border security and immigration for the Texas Border Coalition, which advocates for security on the Texas-Mexico border, said: "(Do) we have the shootings, the kidnappings, all that violence, similar attacks of war? Absolutely not... Now, are there bad people everywhere that want to do bad things? Absolutely. We have that all across the United States." She said, "I go to work every day, I feel no different than I did before escalation of violence happened on the Mexican side. So if that's the definition of spillover violence, there is no spillover here." Vince Perez, Rep. Reyes' press secretary, said Texas hasn't experienced violence like Mexico, noting that even though Juarez is just across the Rio Grande, El Paso is still the second-safest city in the country, after Honolulu. "We're trying to be very careful in terms of what we characterize as spillover violence," he said. But Don Reay, executive director of the Texas Border Sheriff's Coalition, said concerns about spillover are widespread. Reay said: "It does affect the community. The threat is there, continually, day by day, up and down the border." But Reay — who represents 20 sheriffs who belong the coalition, which lobbies for border security funding — said acts of violence north of the border remain "mostly isolated incidents," though "the threat is constant." The University Medical Center in El Paso, for example, often treats victims of shootings in Mexico in the U.S., Reay said. And the threat of cartel members showing up at the hospital to kill the wounded has caused law enforcement to beef up security. However, Margaret Althoff-Olivas, director of public affairs for the University Medical Center of El Paso, said there is "no sense of encroaching violence" at the hospital and that law enforcement hasn't taken extra security measures there since June 2008. On three occasions, beginning in January 2008 when a wounded law enforcement official from Chihuahua State was treated at the hospital, authorities temporarily restricted hospital entrances and required all visitors to enter through metal detectors. Others likewise say they're not aware of spillover violence. Arturo Saruhkan, Mexico's ambassador to the United States, told the Houston Chronicle and San Antonio-Express News: "The term 'spillover' would, at least in my eyes, seem to be a bit of a false dilemma. You speak of ‘spillover' as if you had the pristine waters of Alaska contaminated by the spill of the Exxon Valdez. That is, there was nothing there before the Exxon Valdez created the accident ... To assume that in Texas there are no distribution networks, drug traffickers don't have safe houses, they don't have banks, they don't launder money, is disingenuous or naive at the least. "So, 'spillover'? They're already there." Sarukhan added that more violence in Texas was possible "if the drug trafficking syndicates decide to use San Antonio as their hub and local law enforcement step up their efforts to shut them down." Where does all this leave us with the senators' claim of escalating spillover violence? No one denies the omnipresent threat of spillover violence along the border. Yet officials including law officers closest to the border say there is no surge spilling over. Using its own measure about a year ago, the U.S. DEA similarly said there was no spillover violence. Then again, the Texas DPS says spillover violence, especially related to cartels and gangs, is a statewide problem on the rise. Mindful there's not yet an independent gauge of spillover violence, the authoritative CRS threw up its hands at this issue. For now, we're going with the officials who live closest to the border. There have been violent acts. They are sporadic. They aren't yet measurably increasing. We rate the senators' statement to Obama as Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.

pomt-12005	"Republicans want to restore #gunrights to felons"	mostly true	/new-york/statements/2017/sep/22/jose-serrano/are-republicans-trying-allow-convicted-felons-own-/	Rep. José Serrano, D-Bronx, said legislation he’s against would allow convicted felons to own guns. That’s not allowed under federal law for most people with a felony. Serrano said a proposed amendment could change that. "Now Republicans want to restore #gunrights to felons - something they lose after criminal conviction - CJS bills have prevented for 24 years," Serrano said in a tweet. Serrano was referring to a bill that allocates funds to the U.S. Departments of Justice, Commerce and other agencies. He explained his position when the amendment came up for a vote in the House. "I rise in strong opposition to this very misguided amendment," Serrano said. "This amendment would allow felons and other dangerous individuals to try to regain the ability to own guns by sending an application to the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives." The amendment was agreed to by a voice vote so there’s no record of who voted which way. The bill it’s tied to has passed the House, but not the Senate. Democrats and Republicans are typically divided when it comes to gun control. But would a Republican amendment allow felons to buy guns? The amendment Rep. Ken Buck, R-Colorado, sponsored the amendment. The amendment would give the U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives funding to review applications from people who want to own a gun but legally can’t under federal law. People who have served more than a year in prison are among that group. A felony conviction typically comes with a minimum prison sentence of one year. Anyone convicted of a misdemeanor domestic violence charge or received a dishonorable discharge from the military is also not allowed to own a gun. The ATF has the power to restore gun rights to those people. Federal statute says the bureau may do so if they believe the applicant "will not be likely to act in a manner dangerous to public safety and that the granting of the relief would not be contrary to the public interest." But Congress has denied the bureau the funding for such a program. Congress since 1993 has said no funds given to the agency "shall be available to investigate or act upon applications for relief from Federal firearms disabilities." That’s the legal term for someone who is not allowed to own a gun. The amendment would allow the agency to dip into federal funds to consider those applications. What it means The amendment does not give people with criminal convictions free access to firearms. Each person would be evaluated individually by the ATF. There’s no guarantee that an applicant would be granted gun rights. If someone was convicted of a violent crime, for example, the agency may consider the person to be dangerous to public safety and deny the request. Other criminal convictions may be seen as a lesser threat to public safety. Someone convicted of embezzlement in the past may be judged differently than someone with a violent felony conviction. "Congressman Buck’s amendment allows the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives to once again process petitions from citizens for the restoration of their Second Amendment rights," said Kyle Huwa, Buck’s spokesperson. "This petition process is already established under federal statute. The amendment makes no determination on the substance of the petitions." Our ruling Serrano said Republicans want to restore gun rights to felons. An amendment proposed by a Republican congressman would allow people who have been stripped of their gun rights by the government to ask for them back. That’s not limited to people with a felony and it’s not guaranteed they will be approved. Serrano’s statement is accurate but needs clarification. We rate it Mostly True.

pomt-07652	"We now work the longest hours of any people around the world."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/mar/14/bernie-sanders/sen-bernie-sanders-says-americans-now-work-longest/	It was Friday, and frankly, it had been a long week. So when a Twitter follower asked us to check a claim from U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders, an independent from Vermont, that Americans work longer hours than any other people in the world, we were inclined to agree. But as a March 10, 2011, column from the New York Times' David Brooks so eloquently pointed out, Americans often perceive themselves as better than they are. So we thought we'd better check. Sanders made his comment on C-SPAN's Washington Journal program on March 8, 2011, in response to a caller who said federal programs like welfare have taken away Americans' incentive to work. Sanders responded that while there are certainly people out there who exploit the system, "I think the number of those people is much overrated." "We are the hardest working people in the world," Sanders said. "A few years ago, we had the dubious distinction, I think, of surpassing the Japanese in terms of the number of hours our people worked. We now work the longest hours of any people around the world." We asked Sanders' office for backup and they forwarded us a press release from the International Labour Organization, a London-based United Nations agency that oversees international labor standards. The release ran under the headline, "Americans work longest hours among industrialized countries, Japanese second longest." According to the story, "US workers put in the longest hours on the job in industrialized nations, clocking up nearly 2,000 hours per capita in 1997, the equivalent of almost two working weeks more than their counterparts in Japan where annual hours worked have been gradually declining since 1980, according to a new statistical study of global labour trends published by the International Labour Office." This fact-check seemed like a slam dunk until we checked out the date of the press release: Sept. 6, 1999. And it was based on 1997 data. We contacted the International Labour Office for more recent statistics. They provided a spreadsheet of the latest available data, from 2008, which shows the U.S ranked eighth (out of 28) when it comes to the annual number of hours actually worked per person. Who worked longer? Topping the list was Greece, where people logged an average of 2,120 hours. Also working longer hours: the Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland, Mexico, Iceland and Italy. The U.S., where people worked an average of 1,792 hours, did nudge out Japan, where people worked an average of 1771 hours. That has been consistently true for more than a decade. We also checked with the Organisation for Economic Co-Operation and Development (OECD), a group of 32 large, industrialized democracies, which tracks these kinds of statistics as well. Their report showed a nearly identical number of hours worked by Americans in 2008, 1,796. But in the OECD report, which tracked more countries, the U.S. ranked 12th (out of 35). In addition to the ILO list of countries working more hours, the OECD listed Korea, the Russian Federation, Estonia and Israel. According to the OECD report, Americans worked about 32 more hours a year than the average for all OECD countries. And they worked slightly longer than workers in Japan. A spokesman in Sanders' office stressed the fact that Sanders was correct about the U.S. surpassing Japan in the number of hours worked. And Sanders is correct about that. But we were more interested in the idea that Americans now work longer hours than any other people in the world. The data shows Americans work longer hours than the average for industrialized nations. But the number of hours worked by Americans has been gradually declining (though only slightly) over the last decade. And according to the ILO, we no longer work the longest hours. In fact, that hasn't been true for over a decade. And according to OECD statistics, the U.S. hasn't even cracked the Top 10 in over a decade. There's another caveat. The lists don't include most developing nations. According to a 2003 ILO report, "In all developing Asian economies where data were available, people historically worked more than in industrialized economies. This is a typical sign for developing economies as they often compensate for the lack of technology and capital with people working longer hours." In other words, in addition to those countries listed earlier, there are many more developing countries where people work more hours than Americans. Sanders said "We now work the longest hours of any people around the world." That may have been true when compared to other industrialized nations in 1997. But it's not true now, and it's not true when you consider any country, as Sanders said. We rule his statement False.	None	Bernie Sanders	None	None	None	2011-03-14T11:27:44	2011-03-08	['None']
pomt-14205	"Ted Cruz is mathematically out of winning the race."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/apr/20/donald-trump/trump-largely-accurate-cruz-has-been-mathematicall/	Donald Trump said his landslide win in New York destroyed Ted Cruz’s chances of getting the GOP nomination through the primary process. With 60.5 percent of the votes in the Empire State, the Republican frontrunner is projected to nab 89 delegates, while Cruz picked up none. (Ohio Gov. John Kasich got three.) This means that it is impossible for Cruz to secure the 1,237 delegates needed for the nomination on the first ballot, according to Trump. "Ted Cruz is mathematically out of winning the race," he tweeted April 20. "Now all he can do is be a spoiler, never a nice thing to do. I will beat Hillary!" Does Trump’s math stack up? The answer is more complicated than you’d expect. It boils down to how you interpret some state rules and whether or not you count unbound delegates. We explained the delegate process in-depth here, but here’s a brief overview. To win the Republican nomination, a candidate has to clinch the support of a majority of 2,472 delegates. Most, but not all, are obligated to vote for the candidate who won their congressional district’s or state’s nominating contest. But if no one gets to the 1,237 threshold on a first vote, many delegates are "released" to vote for whomever they want on second and third ballots. So Cruz (or Kasich or really anyone) does have a path forward in this sense. But Trump’s statement is about that first ballot. So far, 41 states and territories with a total of 1,798 delegates have already held primary or state conventions. Fifteen contests with 674 delegates are still up for grabs. We looked at estimates for how many delegates Cruz has won from major outlets like the Associated Press, the New York Times and 538.com (Fox News uses the AP’s counter) and two popular blogs that track delegate math. The figures reported range from 542 "hard" delegates (meaning they’re bound to Cruz on the first ballot) to 559 "soft" delegates (including those who aren’t bound but have said they’d vote for him). This means that Cruz would need at the very least 678 more to get the nomination, so 100 percent of the remaining delegates plus four more. And if we don’t count the unbound delegates from Pennsylvania (54) and West Virginia (three), he’d need 110 percent of the remaining bound delegates. Seems mathematically impossible, right? But here’s the catch: Cruz could fish for more supporters among the 1,798 delegates from states that have already held primaries. At least 45 of them will arrive at the Republican National Convention not committed to any candidate (three from Colorado, five from the Virgin Islands, 8 from Guam, one from American Samoa and 28 from North Dakota). "I suppose if every unpledged delegate broke for him, maybe," said Seth Masket, a political science professor at the University of Denver. Of course, winning 100 percent of the remaining delegates and retroactively recruiting more is a tall feat. Masket pointed out that it’s pretty unrealistic. And a handful of states that award delegates proportionally — for example, New Mexico, Oregon and Washington — make it near impossible, according to Josh Putnam, a government professor at the University of Georgia and founder of Frontloading HQ. "The key is that mathematically (Cruz) can't get there through the allocation process. He would have to lean on some large share of the small sliver of first-ballot unbound delegates," Putnam said. For the record, not even Cruz himself thinks he'll get to 1,237. "We are headed to a contested convention. At this point, nobody is getting 1,237," Cruz told Philadelphia radio host Chris Stigall on April 20. "Donald is going to talk all the time about other folks not getting to 1,237. He's not getting there, either." Our ruling Trump said, "Ted Cruz is mathematically out of winning the race." Cruz would need at the very least 678 more delegates to win the race. It’s impossible for him to reach that number in the remaining primaries, given that there are just 674 delegates left to win. However, he could conceivably find more supporters in the states who’ve already held primaries, given that a few dozen are thus far uncommitted. Trump’s statement is largely accurate but needs additional information.

pomt-14833	The New York Police Department used to have "surveillance going on in and around mosques in New York City. ... Our mayor totally cut that out."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/nov/20/donald-trump/trump-says-nypd-used-spy-mosques/	Following the terrorist attacks in Paris that killed more than 120 this weekend, 2016 presidential candidates are debating how to prevent another terrorist attack on U.S. soil. Republican front-runner Donald Trump, in an interview for MSNBC’s Morning Joe on Nov. 16, 2015, said he would consider surveillance of mosques as a protective measure against radical Islam -- an idea similar to that recently proposed by French interior minister Bernard Cazeneuve. "You’re going to have to watch and study the mosques, because a lot of talk is going on at the mosques," Trump said. "In the old days, meaning a while ago, we had great surveillance going on in and around mosques in New York City. And I understand our mayor totally cut that out... I’m not sure it’s a fact." Well, the Donald’s sources have part of the story -- the New York Police Department used to have a squad dedicated to spying on Muslim communities, and the team was disbanded in 2014. Other aspects of the story, however, aren't so clear. Mapping out Muslims In 2003, the CIA helped the New York Police Department create a squad dedicated to surveilling Muslim communities, called the Demographics Unit, as part of broad policy changes following the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. The Demographics Unit typically consisted of a dozen members, and it focused on identifying places where potential terrorists might be able to blend in with the rest of society. The police essentially mapped out Muslim communities inside and outside the city, detailing where people in traditional Islamic clothes ate, worshipped, shopped and more. According to the New York Times, "plainclothes detectives looked for ‘hot spots’ of radicalization that might give the police an early warning about terrorist plots." The result of the surveillance operations: a rift between the Muslim community and law enforcement, two ongoing federal lawsuits and a failure to generate any terror cases. The Demographics Unit wasn’t the only Muslim-focused surveillance effort in New York. Informants for the NYPD also collected the personal information of members of Muslim student groups on college campuses. Analysts also kept tabs on influential Muslim figures and scholars through college websites and email groups. Police also investigated mosques in the city and labeled certain locations as "terrorism enterprises," which supposedly allowed the police to collect license plate numbers in parking lots, video worshippers and secretly record sermons. None of this surveillance ever led to charges that those mosques or Islamic organizations were related to terrorism. Shutting it down The program was kept under wraps until the Associated Press published an investigation into the police department’s intelligence operations in 2011. Following the AP’s report, John Brennan, President Barack Obama’s counterterrorism adviser, said he was "aware of things that NYPD has been doing, in an exceptionally good way, to protect the citizens of New York City on a daily basis." The NYPD received enormous backlash from civil rights groups over the new details on the Demographics Unit, but the surveillance program remained active until January 2014, when newly elected Mayor Bill de Blasio took office and appointed William J. Bratton as police commissioner. In April 2014, members of the Muslim American Civil Liberties Coalition (MACLC), a New York-based coalition, met with Bratton and other police officials to discuss shutting down the Demographics Unit. The surveillance squad was officially disbanded the next week. "The meeting resulted from a request by police reform and civil rights advocates, and the participants used the opportunity to articulate how the NYPD’s dragnet has harmed American Muslim communities and why it must come to an end," according to a MACLC press release. The move to shut down the Demographics Unit could have been political. But whether or not de Blasio himself "totally cut out" the surveillance program is debatable. According to the New York Times, the move was viewed as a sign that the new police commissioner was distancing himself from the sometimes controversial post-Sept. 11 intelligence practices under former mayor Michael Bloomberg. That’s not to suggest de Blasio wasn’t involved in the discussions surrounding the spying program. While running for mayor in 2012, de Blasio said he believed the surveillance program was legal and was created in good faith to protect New Yorkers. When the program was shuttered in 2014, de Blasio seemed to flip on the issue. "Our administration has promised the people of New York a police force that keeps our city safe, but that is also respectful and fair," de Blasio said in a press release. "This reform is a critical step forward in easing tensions between the police and the communities they serve, so that our cops and our citizens can help one another go after the real bad guys." Shutting down the Demographics Unit didn’t necessarily mean the NYPD stopped keeping tabs on the Islamic community. The New York Times reported that after the surveillance program was disbanded, the police continued to recruit Muslims to be informants for the department. While police officials said the interviews to recruit informants were voluntary, some of the Muslims who were probed said they were "shaken." One person whom police tried to recruit told the New York Times that an officer told him, "You just go to the mosque and the cafe and just say to us if somebody is talking about anything, anything suspicious." We should note that it is unclear if or how the New York Police Department is still surveilling Muslims, especially after new terrorist threats against New York City. Faiza Patel, co-director of the Liberty and National Security Program at the Brennan Center for Justice, said the police have not shuttered its entire surveillance program related to Muslims. "The NYPD has not, to my knowledge, stopped spying on mosques," Patel said. De Blasio has continued to defend the Demographics Unit amidst renewed public attention and federal lawsuits. While a federal judge in New Jersey dismissed a lawsuit over the surveillance last year, a U.S. Court of Appeals in Philadelphia revived the case in October. Finally, Trump said the surveillance program was "great," but not everyone feels that way. Critics of the program have argued that the Demographics Unit only further alienated the Muslim community following the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks. "The Demographics Unit created psychological warfare in our community," Linda Sarsour, a member of the Arab American Association of New York, told the New York Times. "Those documents, they showed where we live. That’s the cafe where I eat. That’s where I pray. That’s where I buy my groceries. They were able to see their entire lives on those maps. And it completely messed with the psyche of the community." When we reached out to the mayor’s office, de Blasio praised the NYPD’s anti-terrorism efforts but didn’t directly address the now-shuttered Demographics Unit. "First and foremost, we always will abide by the U.S. Constitution, which prohibits discrimination against religions," de Blasio wrote in a statement. "Mosques don't commit acts of terrorism. People do." Our ruling Trump said the New York Police Department used to conduct "surveillance in and around mosques in New York City. Our mayor totally cut that out." While Trump doesn’t paint the full picture, there is evidence that supports his point: the New York Police Department used to spy on Muslims. The program actually went further than just surveilling mosques -- detectives mapped out entire Muslim communities, tracked Muslims’ daily activities, investigated Muslim college students and more. The project was shut down, but it was the police commissioner, not the mayor, who officially closed the program. The commissioner is the mayor’s appointee and in all likelihood acted with the mayor’s approval. We can’t say with certainty what kind of surveillance the police department conducts now. But Trump is right that a high-profile program was shuttered. We rate this statement Half True.

pomt-02125	The Pell bridge "is a tourism bridge essentially and not a commuter bridge."	false	/rhode-island/statements/2014/may/11/nicholas-mattiello/rhode-island-house-speaker-nicholas-mattiello-says/	The debate continues over whether there should be a toll on the new Sakonnet River Bridge, one of three bridges motorists can take to get to Newport, R.I. A temporary 10-cent toll on the bridge was supposed to be replaced May 16 with new rates of up to $3.75 per crossing. But that change was put on hold, as legislators debate whether to eliminate the toll entirely and find another way to pay for maintaining the bridge. During an April 6, 2014, appearance on WLNE-Channel 6’s "On the Record With Buddy Cianci," Nicholas Mattiello, Rhode Island's new speaker of the House, was asked about the contentious issue. He said people objecting to a toll on the Sakonnet "have a point. There would be the one bridge in the state other than the Pell Bridge, which is a tourism bridge essentially and not a commuter bridge (with a toll). There's a big difference between the two. So that would be the only commuter bridge in the state that would be tolled." On that same day, WPRI-TV aired an interview with Mattiello in which he again characterized the Pell Bridge, which connects Jamestown to Newport, as "a tourism bridge." We'll let others debate the merits of tolling a bridge depending on whether residents or visitors use it. But, given all the Rhode Island license plates we see on the Pell Bridge, we wondered whether it was accurate to call it a tourism bridge. There's no formal definition of a tourism bridge. But in our mind, it’s one that is primarily used by tourists. We contacted Mattiello's office to ask whether he had any data to distinguish the two. His spokesman, Larry Berman, said Mattiello "considers the Pell Bridge a 'tourist bridge' or a 'destination bridge' because Newport is a world-renowned attraction for tourists," including Rhode Islanders. In 2013, the monthly vehicle count on the Pell Bridge went from 537,000 in February to 722,000 in August, the peak of the tourist season, Berman said. Yet even if those extra 185,000 trips in August were all tourists, that means tourists made up only 26 percent of the traffic during the peak visitor season. That doesn't exactly make it a tourist bridge. But there are other complicating factors. When we asked the Rhode Island Turnpike and Bridge Authority to weigh in on the question, David Darlington, who was chairman at the time but has recently stepped down for health reasons, said its traffic consulting firm was estimating that "on an annual basis 24 hours per day 7 days per week, only 20 percent of the trips on the Pell Bridge would be considered tourists." That's because many of the people traveling the bridge in the summer aren't tourists, but seasonal workers commuting to restaurants, hotels and shops in Newport. In addition, road traffic tends to go up on all roads in the summer, not just those feeding tourist spots. Darlington said a comparable average for Sakonnet would be 18 percent. In addition, when a bridge is used primarily by tourists, fewer drivers tend to have an E-ZPass electronic toll device, said Richard Gobeille, national toll and finance unit manager, at Jacobs Engineering Group, the authority's traffic consultant. "The Pell Bridge is one of the highest in the country" when it comes to its frequency of E-ZPass customers, he said. But we wanted to look at the numbers ourselves. We were able to examine monthly crossing figures in several different ways using data that included how many trips involved in-state and out-of-state E-ZPasses. Every way we ran the numbers, we couldn't prove Mattiello right. For example, even if you took the biggest tourism month of the year and assumed every non-E-ZPass user, every out-of-state E-ZPass user and every Rhode Island E-ZPass user who made fewer than eight trips across the bridge that month was a tourist, tourists trips made up a minority of the vehicle crossings. If you just look at E-ZPass users, Rhode Islanders made nearly 700,000 crossings that month compared with 164,000 trips by out-of-state users. Our ruling House Speaker Nicholas Mattiello said the Pell Bridge "is a tourism bridge essentially and not a commuter bridge." But the people who oversee the bridge say only 20 percent of the traffic is from tourists. And our own analysis of the numbers suggests that the majority -- and by some estimates, the vast majority -- of users aren't crossing as tourists. We rate the claim as False.

pomt-05589	"Obama tells Russia that he'll turn over America's defense system to them if re-elected."	pants on fire!	/georgia/statements/2012/apr/02/eric-johnson/interpretation-obama-gaffe-needs-better-defense/	President Barack Obama tried to make fun of his open-mic gaffe with his Russian counterpart during a recent meeting. But some critics thought there was nothing to laugh about. They quickly accused Obama of behind-the-scenes deal-making with the Russians. The Washington-based news organization Politico carried an article about conservatives concerned about what Obama has in mind when he asked Russian President Dmitry Medvedev for "space" until his presumed re-election in November, when Obama would have "more flexibility" on objections to America’s missile-defense plan. Obama was unaware the microphone between the two men was still on. "This is my last election," Obama said. "After my election, I have more flexibility." Both men nodded. Medvedev said he would pass along Obama’s message to Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin, who will become Russia’s president in May. While some wondered what Obama was talking about, former Georgia state Sen. Eric Johnson, now a lobbyist at the state Capitol, made it clear what Obama’s plans were in a Twitter post. "Obama tells Russia that he’ll turn over America’s defense system to them if re-elected," Johnson wrote a day after the comments were reported. "Was he bowing when he did this? Unbelievable!" This was news to us. There have been no news reports that Obama wants to turn over the nation’s defense system to its one-time Cold War foe. Johnson is well-known in Georgia politics. The Savannah Republican ran for governor in 2010. He was once the Georgia Senate pro tem and remains involved in politics. Johnson maintained his position with us, saying Obama was "up to something" that could hurt U.S. allies such as South Korea if there is no missile defense system and that nation is attacked by its Communist neighbor, North Korea. "I think I heard the same thing South Korea heard, that [Obama] is going to throw us under the bus," Johnson told PolitiFact Georgia. The U.S. Defense Department has a Missile Defense Agency that is conducting research and developing technology to counter ballistic missiles of all ranges that may threaten the nation or its interests. The United States has cooperative programs on missile defense with a number of allies, including Australia, the Czech Republic, Denmark, Germany, Israel, Italy, Japan, the Netherlands, Poland and the United Kingdom, according to the MDA website. Here’s how Bloomberg News described the missile system: "In 2007, the U.S. started preparations for a missile defense system -- ostensibly against an Iranian attack -- with its front legs in Europe. The forward radar for the system was to be in the Czech Republic, and Poland would host the missiles that would shoot down any long-range ballistic missiles Iran might let fly. Russia, however, saw the shield as a naked Cold War power play by the U.S. and was mad as hell." A day after his comments to the Russian leader, Obama said he’s committed to reducing nuclear stockpiles. A national security adviser said the White House will continue to implement the missile-defense system. "The United States is committed to implementing our missile-defense system, which we’ve repeatedly said is not aimed at Russia," Deputy National Security Adviser Ben Rhodes said in a statement, The Washington Post reported. "The two presidents agreed it was best for technical experts to spend time determining their respective positions and provide space on missile-defense cooperation going forward." Vice President Joe Biden also didn't signal that the Obama administration is planning to turn over America’s missile defense system, saying Sunday on Face The Nation that it also helps Israel. Johnson is not buying the White House line. "I think there’s evidence of [Obama] doing everything to weaken America abroad," he said. Republican presidential frontrunner Mitt Romney called Obama’s comments "alarming." Romney said he wanted details about what the two leaders were discussing. Johnson, however, took the rhetoric several steps further. His claim seems way off base from anything we’ve seen and read. Johnson said he likes PolitiFact Georgia’s fact-checking. But he vowed to to stick with his interpretation of Obama’s off-script moment. PolitiFact Georgia didn’t see or hear anything about Obama turning over the nation’s missile defense system. We say "nyet" to Johnson’s statement. This one gets our lowest rating, Pants On Fire.	None	Eric Johnson	None	None	None	2012-04-02T06:00:00	2012-03-26	['Russia', 'United_States', 'Barack_Obama']
pomt-10969	"The three wealthiest people" own "more wealth than the bottom half of the American people."	true	/wisconsin/statements/2018/jul/19/bernie-sanders/bernie-sanders-bill-gates-jeff-bezos-warren-buffet/	Do three Americans really have more wealth than half the country? It’s a claim made by the runner-up for the 2016 Democratic nomination for president, Bernie Sanders. Campaigning on July 14, 2018 for U.S. Sen. Tammy Baldwin, D-Wis., Sanders told a crowd in Eau Claire: "The three wealthiest people" own "more wealth than the bottom half of the American people." The U.S. senator, an independent from Vermont, previously made the claim on Facebook and repeated it three days after his Wisconsin appearance in a column in USA Today. What we found is the wealth lead enjoyed by the three billionaires is even larger than what Sanders said. Like us on Facebook. Follow us on Twitter: @PolitiFactWisc. A study Before we dig in, an important note about the nation’s wealth gap: Many Americans make a good income, have some savings and investments, and own a nice home; they also have debt, for a mortgage, credit cards and other bills. The result is, even some people with relatively healthy incomes, as well as many poorer people, have a negative net worth. To back Sanders’ claim, his campaign pointed us to a November 2017 news article in Forbes. The business magazine reported on a study published that month by the Institute for Policy Studies, which the article described as a left-leaning think tank in Washington, D.C. The study, which advocates for reducing wealth inequality, also gained news coverage from USA Today and The Guardian. And its authors wrote opinion articles about it for Newsweek and the Los Angeles Times. The numbers The study used data from Forbes’ 2017 ranking of the 400 richest Americans; and data for the rest of the country from the 2016 Federal Reserve Survey of Consumer Finances, which the study says has become widely accepted as the most comprehensive government dataset documenting household wealth. PolitiFact has also relied on this Fed survey in our wealth fact checks. The first finding the study reported was this: The three wealthiest people in the United States now own more wealth than the entire bottom half of the American population combined, a total of 160 million people. Those individuals and their source of wealth are, according to the study: 1. Bill Gates, Microsoft: $89 billion 2. Jeff Bezos, Amazon: $81.5 billion 3. Warren Buffett, Berkshire Hathaway: $78 billion That’s a total of $248.5 billion. The wealth of the bottom 160 million was $245 billion, the Institute for Policy Studies' Josh Hoxie told us. That’s a gap of $3.5 billion. Hoxie, a former a aide to Sanders, also pointed out that the wealth of the three billionaires has ballooned to $330 billion, according to Forbes’ latest estimate. We don’t have an updated estimate for the bottom 160 million American, as the Fed survey is done only once every three years. But Hoxie said it’s nearly impossible that the wealth of Americans at the bottom has grown nearly as much as that of the three billionaires. For the 160 million people at the bottom of the scale, by the way, the study used the net worth figure reported by the Fed and then subtracted automobiles and other "durable goods" such as electronics, furniture, and household appliances, from that figure. Subtracting durable goods from net worth "offers us a more accurate depiction of household wealth as these items are not easily sellable and neither appreciate nor hold constant their value," the study says. Other viewpoints More fact checks on wealth inequality Michael Moore, in 2011: "Just 400 Americans -- 400 -- have more wealth than half of all Americans combined." True. One Wisconsin Now, in 2013: "The Walton family, which owns Wal-Mart, controls a fortune equal to the wealth of the bottom 42 percent of Americans combined." True. Starbucks, in 2015: "White people control almost 90 percent of the nation's wealth." True. The study’s methodology is sound and its conclusion cited by Sanders is accurate, according to Abdur Chowdhury, an emeritus economics professor at Marquette University in Milwaukee, and economics professor Emmanuel Saez, director of the Center for Equitable Growth at the University of California, Berkeley. As an aside, we’ll note that Saez also said Sanders’ claim is "somewhat meaningless." "The meaningful thing to say," Saez told us, "is the bottom half of the U.S. families owns essentially no wealth on net, because debts cancel out whatever small assets they may have, on average." Our rating Sanders says: "The three wealthiest people" own "more wealth than the bottom half of the American people." The wealth of Gates, Bezos and Buffett exceeded that of the 160 million at the bottom of the scale, according to a 2017 study. And more recent estimates indicate the wealth of the three has since grown dramatically, widening the gap even more. We rate Sanders’ statement True.

pomt-09981	In Iraq, "civilian deaths, incidents of bombings, etc., remain very low relative to what was going on last year."	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/apr/30/barack-obama/obama-correct-civilian-deaths-and-bombings-are-dow/	In a news conference on April 29, 2009, President Barack Obama was asked if recent violence in Iraq would affect his strategy or timetable for withdrawal of U.S. troops. Earlier in day, three car bombs killed at least 51 people in markets in Baghdad. Obama responded by saying the recent violence should be seen in context. "Well, first of all, I think it's important to note that although you've seen some spectacular bombings in Iraq that are a legitimate cause of concern, civilian deaths, incidents of bombings, et cetera, remain very low relative to what was going on last year, for example," Obama said. "And so you haven't seen the kinds of huge spikes that you were seeing for a time. The political system is holding and functioning in Iraq." We checked with the Defense Department and other sources to see if Obama was correct about declining rates of civilian deaths and bombings. The short answer is that he is. The number of civilian deaths and bombings in Iraq peaked during 2007, and has steadily decreased since a surge of forces was approved by President George W. Bush. Obama specifically said civilian deaths and bombings have decreased "relative to what was going on last year." So we compared recent numbers with early 2008. According to a report from the Defense Department based on information from coalition forces and the Iraqi government, civilian deaths in Iraq ranged from 600 in January 2008 up to 950 in April. The number of civilian deaths in early 2009 have been markedly lower: 270 in January, 230 in February and 260 in March. That's dramatically lower than late 2006 and early 2007, when civilian deaths were about 3,500 a month. As for bombings, those too hit a peak in early 2007, with about 130 in February of that year. By early 2008, they were down to 40 to 60 explosions per month. The recent report to Congress noted that current levels of bombings were lower than at any time since the spring of 2004, but added that al-Qaida "retains the intent and capability to carry out spectacular attacks." Lt. Col. Patrick Ryder, a spokesman for the Defense Department, told PolitiFact that in addition to fewer bombings, there has been a shift in targets. At the height of violence in years past, he said, most bombings were aimed at U.S. military and Iraq military and security forces. Recent attacks have targeted mosques, markets and other "soft targets" in an attempt to incite sectarian violence. That suggests opposition resources are more limited than in the past, Ryder said. The nonpartisan Brookings Institution also puts out something called the Iraq Index that keeps monthly tabs on security and reconstruction in Iraq. The detailed reports track the number of multiple-fatality bombings (more than a third of them from suicide bombings), as well as the number of people killed and wounded in those bombings. Both also back up Obama's contention. We note that Brookings bases much of its data on information from the U.S. government, but also gets information from press reports and other sources. So information from coalition forces in Iraq, the Iraqi government and press reports all back up Obama's statement. We rule it True.

pomt-05106	"Obamacare adds trillions to our deficits and to our national debt."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/jun/28/mitt-romney/mitt-romney-says-obamacare-adds-trillions-deficit/	How is it that a law can raise taxes and cut spending, but also add trillions to the deficit? That was Mitt Romney’s claim after the U.S. Supreme Court upheld the core of the health care law on June 28, 2012. "Obamacare raises taxes on the American people by approximately $500 billion. Obamacare cuts Medicare -- cuts Medicare by approximately $500 billion," Romney said. "And even with those cuts and tax increases, Obamacare adds trillions to our deficits and to our national debt, and pushes those obligations on to coming generations." Here, we’re fact-checking Romney’s claim that "Obamacare adds trillions to our deficits and to our national debt." It’s a topic we’ve researched before. We asked the Romney campaign for their evidence for this statement, but we didn’t hear back. For claims about laws that are not yet fully enacted, our go-to source is the Congressional Budget Office. It’s a nonpartisan, widely respected agency with an expert staff that generates projections and reports about how proposed laws affect the federal budget. The Congressional Budget Office is not always right in its projections. In recent years, for example, it overestimated how much it would cost to cover prescription drugs for seniors in Medicare. The program actually came in under projections. But for claims about deficits, we consider the Congressional Budget Office, often called the CBO, to be the standard by which we fact-check claims. The CBO said this about the health care law back in 2010: It lowers the deficit, by about $124 billion over 10 years. And in 2011, when Republicans offered a bill to repeal the health care law, the CBO said that increased the deficit, by about $210 billion over 10 years. Now, is the CBO infallible? Certainly not. And good questions have been raised about some of the CBO’s methods in accounting for the health care law’s effects. We reported on some those concerns in great detail in a fact-check of statement from U.S. Rep Paul Ryan, R-Wisc. He said the law was "accelerating our country toward bankruptcy." We rated that Mostly False. The CBO itself acknowledges the uncertainty surrounding its estimates. Its reports regularly warn that uncertainty increases as it makes projections farther into the future. And, the Supreme Court ruling may change certain elements of the health care law’s costs, especially as it affects Medicaid spending. Medicaid is the joint federal-state health insurance program for the very poor. A statement on the CBO website on the day of the ruling said, "CBO is in the process of reviewing the Supreme Court’s decision related to the Affordable Care Act to assess the effect on CBO’s projections of federal spending and revenue under current law. We expect that this assessment will probably take some time." Still, we find no factual basis for Romney’s claim that the law "adds trillions to our deficits and to our national debt." We rate his statement False.	None	Mitt Romney	None	None	None	2012-06-28T17:25:55	2012-06-28	['None']
pomt-15300	Says John McCain "has done nothing to help the vets."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/jul/21/donald-trump/after-not-war-hero-remark-donald-trump-says-john-m/	Facing a continuing maelstrom over his remark that Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., is "not a war hero," billionaire businessman and GOP presidential candidate Donald Trump wants to shift the focus from McCain’s service record to his track record. McCain may talk a lot about supporting American troops, Trump insisted on ABC’s This Week, but he doesn’t walk the walk. "I'm very disappointed in John McCain, because the vets are horribly treated in this country. I'm fighting for the vets. I've done a lot for the vets," Trump said on July 19. "He's done nothing to help the vets. And I will tell you, they are living in hell." He echoed the point that same day in an editorial published in USA Today. Trump wrote: "Thanks to McCain and his Senate colleague Bernie Sanders, their legislation to cover up the VA scandal, in which 1,000+ veterans died waiting for medical care, made sure no one has been punished, charged, jailed, fined or held responsible. McCain has abandoned our veterans. I will fight for them." Is Trump correct that that McCain -- a Vietnam prisoner of war and current chairman of the Senate Armed Services committee -- hasn’t helped his fellow veterans? The Trump campaign never got back to us, but McCain’s office did, and, not surprisingly, they begged to differ. They provided a wide variety of examples of things McCain has done for veterans during his nearly three-decade congressional career. Here are a few of the most recent ones: • Military families. In June 2015, McCain co-sponsored an amendment to the National Defense Authorization Act of 2016 to cover the travel costs for the family of troops killed in overseas missions. The amendment was adopted by the Senate by unanimous consent. • Veterans health. McCain introduced the Clay Hunt Suicide Prevention for American Veterans Act in early 2015 to increase access to mental health support for veterans. It has become law. • Department of Veterans Affairs. In 2014, McCain -- along with Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont, a Democratic presidential candidate -- led efforts to address the scandal over secret waiting lists at VA hospitals by pushing the The Veterans’ Access to Care through Choice, Accountability, and Transparency Act all the way to enactment. In 2015, McCain co-sponsored a bill to increase accountability at the department. • Non-legislative support. McCain’s office employs five caseworkers solely dedicated to helping veterans who are running into problems at the Department of Veterans Affairs. A spokeswoman told us McCain’s office has handled more than 2,000 veterans-related cases in 2015 alone. We also reached out to veterans groups. Even those who have taken issue with McCain’s record on veterans disagreed with Trump that McCain has "done nothing" for vets. Decorated veteran Brandon Friedman, a former Obama administration official and vice chairman of the progressive VoteVets PAC, detailed McCain’s history of failing veterans in 2008, but rejected Trump’s characterization. " ‘Nothing’ is a strong word," Friedman told us. "He hasn't been great on veterans issues. That being said … the senator doesn't deserve that." Groups that gave McCain failing grades during his 2008 White House bid agreed with Friedman. Though McCain voted with Disabled Veterans of America about 20 percent of the time in 2008, the group praised McCain in 2014 "for putting partisan politics aside to quickly pass bipartisan legislation in response to the current VA health care crisis." Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America also gave McCain a grade of D in 2010, but pointed to a specific example of McCain’s recent support. "I have had the honor of working with Sen. McCain on key veterans legislation, including the Clay Hunt Suicide Prevention for American Veterans Act," CEO Paul Rieckhoff wrote in the New York Daily News. Other groups also rushed to McCain’s defense. "Donald Trump also revealed that he has no idea what he is talking about with regards to reforming and fixing the VA. If he did, he would have known that Senator McCain has been a leader in fighting to give veterans more health care choices and to hold the VA accountable for its failures," Concerned Veterans for America wrote in statement Navy Vice Adm. Norb Ryan, president of the Military Officers Association of America, said in a press release that McCain has a been a "champion" for troops and veterans, arguing that no one has visited American troops more than McCain. "We can disagree with some of Sen. McCain’s positions at times, but we can never say he has abandoned the troops," Ryan wrote on July 20. "We should acknowledge the facts: John McCain cares deeply about our men and women in uniform, and through his actions, he has made a real difference for our troops. Mr. Trump owes Sen. McCain and all veterans an apology." Our ruling Trump said that McCain "has done nothing to help the vets." While many veterans’ groups have had their differences with McCain over the years over specific legislation and his general approach to veterans’ issues, that’s not the same as saying he’s done "nothing" for veterans. In fact, just within the past two years, McCain has sponsored and helped enact several major provisions to help veterans. He also devotes a significant portion of his office staff to offer veterans on casework. We rate Trump’s claim False.	None	Donald Trump	None	None	None	2015-07-21T14:33:31	2015-07-19	['None']
pomt-05952	Says Mitt Romney "was one of the first national Republican leaders to endorse" Marco Rubio.	half-true	/florida/statements/2012/jan/25/marco-rubio/was-mitt-romney-one-first-endorse-marco-rubio/	The battle for Hispanic voters in the Republican primary is turning ugly, and U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio is trying to tamp down some of the rancor. Rubio stepped in when Newt Gingrich went so far as to compare Republican rival Mitt Romney with -- prepare yourselves! -- Charlie Crist. "We discovered last night that Mitt Romney has picked up Charlie Crist's campaign people," said Gingrich at a campaign stop in St. Petersburg on Jan. 24, 2012. "That sort of tells you everything you needed to know about this contest." Gingrich’s mention of Crist drew yelps and boos from the crowd at the Tick Tock Restaurant. Florida Republicans remember well that Crist left the party in 2010 to run as an independent for the U.S. Senate. The race between Gingrich and Romney has been inflamed by Spanish-language radio ads, web ads on the Drudge Report website and news reports on the conservative website Newsmax that said Romney was using Crist’s former campaign staff. Rubio was concerned enough about the attacks that he released a statement the same day. (Rubio has said he will not endorse in the race.) "Mitt Romney is no Charlie Crist," Rubio said. "Romney is a conservative, and he was one of the first national Republican leaders to endorse me. He came to Florida, campaigned hard for me and made a real difference in my race." Rubio’s comments caught our attention, because our memory was that Romney endorsed relatively late in the race for U.S. Senate. We decided to dig into the archives to see if Romney was in fact "one of the first national Republican leaders" to endorse Rubio. To understand the full web of endorsements at work here, we’ll go back to the Republican presidential primary of 2008. Romney, the former governor of Massachusetts, was then challenging U.S. Sen. John McCain and former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee for the nomination. In that race, Rubio endorsed Huckabee relatively early, in 2007. (Rubio was then speaker of the Florida House.) Crist, meanwhile, waited until just before the Florida primary in early 2008 to endorse McCain. McCain beat Romney in Florida and went on to win the nomination. In 2009, Rubio was widely considered a long-shot against Crist for the Republican nomination for U.S. Senate. Party leadership got behind Crist early that year, while Rubio secured early endorsements from Huckabee and U.S. Sen. Jim DeMint, R-S.C., a tea party favorite. Rubio built up his campaign through 2009. By spring of 2010, Rubio gained endorsements from former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani and U.S. Sen. Tom Coburn, R-Okla. In March 2010, Romney was on book tour in Florida and was asked regularly about endorsing in the Crist-Rubio race. Romney said several times that he was undecided and generally didn’t endorse in primaries. By April, though, Crist’s campaign was in serious trouble. Polls showed he would likely lose. Crist further angered Republicans with a veto of a bill limiting teachers tenure on April 15. The news broke the next day that Romney was endorsing Rubio, and the official endorsement came April 19. When he made his endorsement, Romney was certain enough of Rubio’s position in the primary that he publicly urged Crist to stay in the Republican Party and accept a loss. Rubio went on to a decisive victory over Crist and Democrat Kendrick Meek. We contacted representatives for both Romney and Rubio about this fact-check. Rubio’s staff said his comments spoke for themselves. The Romney campaign sent us the following statement: "Sen. Marco Rubio is an outstanding advocate for fiscal responsibility and a principled voice for conservative values in the United States Senate. Gov. Romney was proud to support Senator Rubio in 2010 and honored to have campaigned with him across Florida." Our ruling Rubio said that Romney was "one of the first national Republican leaders to endorse me." Romney did endorse Rubio before Crist dropped out of the primary in 2010. But it was clear at the time that Rubio would have thumped Crist in a primary if Crist hadn’t dropped out. The main point of Rubio’s comments was to lower the temperature in the Republican race. But it bears noting that Romney’s endorsement of Rubio was something less than a pioneering stand. We rate Rubio’s statement Half True.

pomt-09788	Families are paying $900, on average, "in higher premiums because of uncompensated care."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/sep/20/barack-obama/uninsured-cost-shifting-debated-experts/	President Barack Obama went on the Sunday news shows to make the case for health reform. This Week host George Stephanopolous questioned Obama on his support for an individual mandate, which requires everyone who can find affordable coverage to purchase health insurance. Obama defended the matter as a fairness issue to people who now have coverage. "Here's what's happening," Obama said. "You and I are both paying 900 bucks on average — our families — in higher premiums because of uncompensated care. Now, what I've said is that, if you can't afford health insurance, you certainly shouldn't be punished for that. That's just piling on. "If, on the other hand, we're giving tax credits, we've set up an exchange, you are now part of a big pool. We've driven down the costs, we've done everything we can, and you actually can afford health insurance. But you've just decided, 'You know what? I want to take my chances,' and then you get hit by a bus, (then) you and I have to pay for the emergency room care." Health policy experts call this dynamic "cost-shifting." The idea is that hospitals treat uninsured patients for free or for below their costs, then make up for it by charging insured patients more. The hospitals bill the insurance companies at artificially higher rates, and the insurance companies pass the cost to customers through higher premiums. Obama said for family coverage, the shift is $900. That's supported by a 2005 study by Families USA, a liberal advocacy group, which found the cost shift to people with insurance was $922 for a family policy and $341 for an individual policy. Perhaps Obama was recalling this figure from the presidential campaign, though, because Families USA — a consumer-oriented nonprofit that advocates for better health care — commissioned a study released this year that found cost-shifting was higher. Insured people paid $1,017 more for a family policy and $368 more for an individual policy due to cost-shifting, according to the report. But here's where things get a bit tricky. In 2008, the Kaiser Family Foundation released a report questioning the methodology of the Families USA study and hypothesizing that cost-shifting is not that significant. Let's step back and explain what the experts are counting. They use federal data on medical expenditures to calculate the total amount spent on care for the uninsured. Then they subtract whatever the uninsured themselves paid for care, then what government and charities paid. The remainder of the cost is what people with insurance are paying for through higher premiums, according to Families USA. When Kaiser looked for what the government was paying for uninsured care, it found a lot more than Families USA. To give you an idea of how technical this can get, we'll quote from the Kaiser study about the additional government spending it found. It found "a share of Medicare IME, a portion of Medicaid supplemental payments made through upper payment limit (UPL) provisions, and federal and state direct service programs (community health center grants, maternal and child health grants, Ryan White CARE Act funds, the National Health Service Corps, Indian Health Service, and the Veterans Health Administration)." The Kaiser study documented fluctuations in private premiums over many years, and the data don't seem to correlate with costs for the uninsured. Rather, cost-shifting is "more strongly related to fluctuations in payments by Medicare and Medicaid," the Kaiser study said. The Kaiser study did not set a per-policy number the way the Families USA study did. But Kaiser did say that cost-shifting might account for 1.7 percent of all private premiums. So who is right? We reviewed the three studies and we don't see any obvious problems or conflicts. Families USA advocates for consumers, but its 2005 study was conducted under contract by Dr. Kenneth Thorpe of Emory University, a well-respected health care policy expert. Barring new evidence, this seems like a genuine disagreement between experts on a complex issue. President Obama said "You and I are both paying 900 bucks on average — our families — in higher premiums because of uncompensated care." That's an accurate citing of older data. But another study found that cost-shifting for the uninsured was not significant. Because there's major disagreement on this issue, we rate Obama's statement Half True.

pomt-07030	"One of the reasons that Budweiser stayed in New Jersey is the money they got from RGGI to put solar on their roof to save on their energy costs."	false	/new-jersey/statements/2011/jul/04/jeff-tittel/new-jersey-sierra-club-president-jeff-tittel-says-/	The "King of Beers" has reigned in Newark for more than half a century. But according to Jeff Tittel, director of the New Jersey chapter of the Sierra Club, Anheuser-Busch’s Budweiser brewery may have been seeking a new home. Soon after Gov. Chris Christie announced plans to pull New Jersey out of a regional cap-and-trade program, lawmakers, state officials, business leaders and environmental leaders debated the merits of the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative, or RGGI, during a state assembly committee hearing. In response to testimony that RGGI, known as "Reggie," was one of the reasons businesses were leaving the state, Tittel said, "When we talk about businesses, and I know this from first hand, one of the reasons that Budweiser stayed in New Jersey is the money they got from RGGI to put solar on their roof to save on their energy costs." RGGI caps the amount of carbon dioxide power plants can emit in 10 states. Credits can be bought or sold if plants need to release more or less carbon dioxide. Proceeds from the sales help participating states fund clean energy initiatives. PolitiFact New Jersey questioned whether the St. Louis-based beer company had ever considered abandoning its throne in the Garden State and if a reduction in energy costs from solar panels funded by RGGI was one of the reasons that convinced them to stay. Neither was true. First, let’s note that Anheuser-Busch’s Newark brewery had solar panels installed on its roof. A May 17, 2010 news release issued by Anheuser-Busch announcing the installation said more than 3,000 photovoltaic solar panels, covering 65,000 square feet, would be capable, at peak production, of "covering nearly five percent of the brewery's electricity demand." Orion Energy Systems installed and operate the solar panels, according to the release. Anheuser-Busch officials quoted in the release talked about how the installation is an example of the company’s commitment to alternate energy sources. There is no mention of the solar panel project swaying the company to stay in New Jersey. So the brewery had solar panels installed on its roof, but did the beer company receive RGGI funds for the project? Tittel said his statement was based on a conversation he had with Al Komjathy, a lobbyist with the firm Komjathy & Stewart, which represents Anheuser-Busch, among other companies. But Komjathy said he never spoke with Tittel about the issue. "I never had that discussion with him," he told PolitiFact New Jersey. And Anheuser-Busch told us in a statement: "Our Newark brewery did not receive funding from the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative for the solar panel project and there were no plans to relocate the brewery." It’s worth noting that Anheuser-Busch applied for funding for a cogeneration power plant at its Newark brewery through the Clean Energy Solutions Capital Investment initiative, a financing program funded by RGGI proceeds and controlled by the state Economic Development Authority. Laura Jones, a spokeswoman for the state Economic Development Authority, said the agency approved Anheuser-Busch’s request, but that the beer company never used the funding. Tittel said at the time he made the claim about the solar panels, "I thought it was accurate." Now, he said, "most of what I said was accurate but not 100 percent." Most? Try little to nothing. The only thing Tittel got correct in his statement is that solar panels were installed on the roof of Anheuser-Busch’s Newark brewery. Funding for the project did not come from RGGI and the company said it was never considering leaving the state. Tittel tried to argue that although the brewery did not receive funding through RGGI, legislation, often called "the RGGI law," helped the project. As part of the project, PSEG Power agreed to purchase solar renewable energy certificates produced by the solar panels, according to PSEG spokesman Fran Sullivan. Tittel said he was referring to Section 13 in "the RGGI law" -- the section allows electric and utility companies to charge ratepayers for investments they make in energy efficiency and renewable energy programs. However, a spokesman for the state Board of Public Utilities told us that because PSEG Power is not regulated, Section 13 does not apply. Let’s recap. Tittel claimed one of the reasons Anheuser-Busch’s Budweiser brewery in Newark stayed in New Jersey is because they received funding through RGGI to install solar panels, thereby reducing their energy costs. Anheuser-Busch told us they weren’t planning on relocating the brewery and that they did not receive funds through RGGI for the solar project. We rate Tittel’s claim False.

pomt-09621	Says approximately 70 percent of jobs created in the United States in November 2007-2008 were in Texas.	false	/texas/statements/2010/jan/12/rick-perry/perry-claims-texas-accounted-70-percent-new-jobs-2/	Gov. Rick Perry frequently celebrates the Texas economy for out-performing those of other states. His message that Texas could be a model for other states has been picked up in articles by Investors Business Daily, Trends Magazine and The Weekly Standard — all of which are touted on Perry's campaign Web site. The articles repeat the claim Perry made in a Jan. 15, 2009 press release stating: "Approximately 70 percent of the jobs created in the U.S. from November 2007-2008 were in Texas." We wondered if this eye-popping claim -- posted online by Perry's office and later echoed by State Comptroller Susan Combs, a fellow statewide officeholder -- was true. Perry's office pointed us to the Texas Workforce Commission, where number crunchers said they started their analysis by adding up the total jobs created in states, including Texas, that had job gains during the one-year period. There were 13 other job-gaining states, plus the District of Columbia. The other gaining states were Oklahoma, Maryland, Louisiana, Wyoming, Kansas, Colorado, North Dakota, South Dakota, New Hampshire, Iowa, Virginia, Alaska and Nebraska. Texas's 221,000 new jobs amounted to 71 percent of the 310,000 jobs gained among those states and D.C. The state's economy was "really kicking," said Ann Hatchitt, the commission's director of communications. But the commission's conclusion comes with a big wrinkle. Hatchitt said the commission did not take into account the new jobs created in 36 other states where job losses overall outnumbered gains. Veronica Sanchez Downey, who analyzes data for the commission, said she'd feel comfortable summarizing the commission's conclusion about Texas job gains this way: "Of all the states that gained jobs in the U.S. including the District of Columbia, Texas accounted for" 67.2 percent of the added jobs from November 2007 to November 2008. The 67.2-percent figure reflects adjustments of the data since the initial research. Perry, of course, didn't say it that way. Two outside experts said the governor's 70-percent claim overstates the Texas share of jobs created nationally. Michael Brandl, a senior lecturer at the University of Texas McCombs School of Business, said the commission's method of calculating the percentage wasn't correct. By excluding all states with net job losses -- regardless of any job gains in those states -- the Texas share of total new jobs in the U.S. was overblown, even "laughable," he said. "To say it's misleading is to be kind," Brandi said. "It's just not true." Douglas Hall, director of the Economic Research and Analysis Network at Washington's non-partisan Economic Policy Institute, agreed that Perry's summary was inaccurate. The institute focuses on the economic needs of low- and middle-income Americans. Hall stressed that employment estimates, based on monthly surveys of employers, are frequently adjusted anyway: "On an annual basis, the numbers are revised significantly and what can often happen is that six of the previous 18 months get changed not just in their magnitude but sometimes even in their direction, highlighting the fact that one must always take these numbers with somewhat of a grain of salt." We find Perry's conclusion to be incorrect and highly misleading, especially because the agency that made the calculation quickly pointed out an accurate -- though less dramatic -- way of summarizing its finding. We rate Perry's statement as False.	None	Rick Perry	None	None	None	2010-01-12T15:51:05	2009-01-15	['United_States', 'Texas']
pomt-07516	On bipartisan redistricting.	full flop	/virginia/statements/2011/apr/08/thomas-norment-jr/sen-thomas-norment-now-says-he-opposes-bipartisan-/	Redistricting is an ugly process, one that almost always leaves bruised feelings among the minority party. And that’s playing out in both chambers of the General Assembly this week. Republicans control the House of Delegates and have eliminated the district of Minority Leader Ward Armstrong, D-Henry. Democrats control the Senate and are drawing four Republican incumbents into two districts. Senate Minority Leader Thomas K. Norment, Jr., R-James City, was especially upset with the Democratic proposal. "Senate Democrats have crafted an outrageously partisan redistricting plan that will go down as one of the most notorious examples of gerrymandering in history," Norment said in a press release. The Senate plan, drawn primarily by Sen. Janet D. Howell, D-Fairfax, would squeeze GOP Sens. Frank W. Wagner and Jeff McWaters, both of Virginia Beach, into the same district. It also would lump Sen. Stephen D. Newman, R-Lynchburg, into the same district as Sen. Ralph K. Smith, R-Botetourt County. Ten years ago, when Norment was Senate majority leader, he did the same thing. With Republicans holding 22 seats to the Democrats’ 18, the Senate drew election maps, Norment’s party cramped Sen. Mary Margaret Whipple, D-Arlington, into the same district as Sen. Leslie L. Byrne, D-Fairfax. Sen. Madison E. Marye, D-Montgomery, was grouped with Sen. Malfourd "Bo" Trumbo, R-Botetourt, with the Marye’s seat moving to Northern Virginia. The moves created a pair of GOP-leaning open seats, designed for and won by Republicans who were then serving in the House of Delegates. The gerrymandering left Byrne furious and complaining that Republicans were unfairly singling out Democratic women. Norment was unsympathetic, sarcastically replying that "subtlety is lost" on the Democrat. The next day, Norment said the 2001 map was far less extreme than those drawn in 1991, when Democrats held the Senate. Norment said redistricting is "a political process." Norment isn’t the only senator to change his redistricting tune. Ten years ago Howell called the GOP’s Senate plan "absurd." On April 5, she said the 2011 map she drew for the Democratic majority followed the same principles as the 2001 GOP plan, including the use of a 2 percent population deviation for districts. Howell also noted that her plan splits 43 localities into different districts, quite similar to the 41 cleaved in the 2001 map. Norment now complains that Senate Democrats are pushing "one of the most notorious examples of gerrymandering in history." But to our eyes, Howell’s plan uses many of the same criteria Norment endorsed 10 years ago. Just as two Democrats stood to lose their seats in 2001, two Republicans are out of luck in 2011.

pomt-00312	Says "Rep. Ann Wagner, a three-term incumbent, has never held a town hall in the Second District."	mostly true	/missouri/statements/2018/sep/21/cort-vanostran/has-ann-wagner-held-any-town-halls-her-district/	Is it true that one congresswoman has never held a "town hall" with her constituents during the three terms she’s served? In a press release on Aug. 21, Democrat Cort VanOstran called out Republican Rep. Ann Wagner for not responding to his demands to have a debate and tied it in with her unavailability to constituents: "Rep. Ann Wagner, a three-term incumbent, has never held a town hall in the Second District." VanOstran is trying to unseat Wagner in Missouri’s 2nd Congressional District, which encompasses much of St. Louis County and stretches as far out as O’Fallon. Given the use of the word "never," we found VanOstran’s contention surprising — three terms is a long time to have never held a town hall. We decided to see if this was true. We began by looking at the Merriam-Webster Dictionary definition for "town hall." It states that a town hall is "an event at which a public official or political candidate addresses an audience by answering questions posed by individual members." We reached out to VanOstran’s campaign for their evidence. Campaign manager Claire Botnick said the VanOstran camp simply called Wagner’s camp to ask about it, and a representative from her office said Wagner has never held a public in-person town hall. The Wagner campaign declined an offer to comment on the record, so we examined the information we could find on our own. Wagner has held multiple town halls conducted via telephone (known as tele-town halls), according to her social media accounts, coverage in the St. Louis Post-Dispatch and St. Louis Public Radio and an email exchange with one of her constituents. However, finding in-person town halls conducted by Wagner was more difficult. A quick search of the term "town hall" on both Wagner’s Facebook and Twitter accounts showed eight events where Wagner described herself at a town hall. But all of these events were held by private companies, where she was speaking to employees. We asked whether the events were public or private and whether Wagner addressed questions from the audience as described in the Merriam-Webster definition. According to company spokespersons and social media posts: • In five cases, Wagner held ask-and-answer meetings for employees only: at Monsanto, MetLife, Express Scripts, Charter Communications and RGA. • At Maritz Global Events, Wagner didn’t take questions, meaning the company event doesn’t fit the definition of a town hall. • Equifax couldn’t confirm whether questions were asked, but a news release noted a "town hall session" with Wagner after a ribbon-cutting. It is unclear whether that event was open to the public. • United Health Group didn’t respond to PolitiFact. Beyond social media, we scrolled through articles about public events attended by Wagner that might have resembled town halls. We found no examples of events that fit the traditional definition of town halls. Bottom line: We could not find evidence of an in-person, public town hall where Wagner took questions from constituents. At most, she has held town halls that were limited to a private group of employees at a specific company. University of Alabama political scientist Joe Smith told PolitiFact Texas that he doesn’t view closed-to-the-public events with a company’s employees to be genuine town halls. The employees who attend "know that their employer has arranged for and endorsed the visit, and that therefore assertive questions are not welcome," Smith said. Duquesne University professor Mike Dillon agreed. "The term ‘town hall’ implies an event is open to the entire community and that competing ideas will be welcomed and discussed," Dillon said. Our ruling VanOstran said Wagner has never held a town hall in the 2nd District during her tenure as congresswoman. She has held telephone-based town halls, as well as private events for particular companies’ employees. But experts say that a town hall traditionally involves a public official inviting any constituent to gather in a public space and ask him or her questions. So VanOstran has a point. We rate the statement Mostly True.	None	Cort VanOstran	None	None	None	2018-09-21T21:36:45	2018-08-21	['None']
pomt-02334	Says Marco Rubio believes the earth is 9,000 years old and that humans hunted dinosaurs to extinction; says Rand Paul believes the earth is 10,000 years old and God removed dinosaurs "to make space for humans."	pants on fire!	/truth-o-meter/statements/2014/mar/25/facebook-posts/facebook-meme-claims-rand-paul-and-marco-rubio-hav/	A new Facebook meme paints two leading Republicans as anti-science because of their alleged views of the age of the Earth. The Facebook group Being Liberal posted a picture March 10, 2014, featuring side-by-side images of Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., and Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., looking somewhat sheepish. Bolded text under the images describes the senators’ views on the age of the Earth and the extinction of the dinosaurs. According to the meme, Rubio "believes Earth (is) 9,000 years old," and "humans hunted dinosaurs to extinction." Paul, the image proclaims, says the Earth is 10,000 years old and believes "God made dinosaurs disappear to make space for humans." The post received about 5,500 likes and was shared more than 4,000 times. Upon seeing this, we couldn’t resist digging in and finding out just what these two senators believe about the age of the Earth and the demise of the dinosaurs. Rubio It seems the backing for the claim about Rubio comes from a November 2012 interview with GQ magazine, when Michael Hainey asked, "How old do you think the Earth is?" Rubio didn’t directly answer the question, instead saying, "I'm not a scientist, man. I can tell you what recorded history says, I can tell you what the Bible says, but I think that's a dispute amongst theologians, and I think it has nothing to do with the gross domestic product or economic growth of the United States." He later called the planet’s age "one of the great mysteries." The comment drew criticism around the Internet, sparking a string of opinion pieces from blogs and mainstream news organizations alike. Commentators specifically wondered about Rubio’s answer because of his position on the Senate Commerce, Science, and Transportation Committee. Rubio clarified his answer in another interview, this time with Politico on Dec. 5, 2012. "First of all, let me tell you about the answer I gave. The answer I gave was actually trying to make the same point the president made a few years ago, and that is there is no scientific debate on the age of the Earth. I mean, it’s established, pretty definitively. It’s 4 and a half… at least four and half billion years old. I was referring to a theological debate, which is a pretty healthy debate," Rubio said. So, Rubio didn’t actually peg the age of the Earth at 9,000 years in the GQ interview, and even gave the widely accepted scientific answer in the later interview with Politico. Paul We had to go all the way back to 2010 to find a statement from Paul about the age of the Earth. It turned out to be even more vague than Rubio’s answer to GQ. In June 2010, Paul gave a speech at a Christian Homeschool Educators of Kentucky meeting, after which he took questions from the audience. One audience member asked the then-candidate for Senate, "Was there a point in life that you became Christian that you recognized? And also, how old is the world?" Paul joked at first, saying he was only taking "easy questions," and then described the origins of his faith. He then said he would "pass" on the question concerning the age of the Earth. Other than that, Paul hasn’t made public comments on his opinions about when the Earth came to be. Our ruling Being Liberal’s Facebook post claimed Rubio and Paul believe the Earth is 9,000 and 10,000 years old, respectively. While both men have made vague statements concerning their beliefs about the age of the Earth, neither has publicly cited the figures claimed in the post, and Rubio has even given the widely held scientific answer to the question. As for the senators’ views on the fate of the dinosaurs, we’ll take a page from Rubio’s playbook and call it one of the world’s great mysteries, because it doesn’t appear either has said anything in public regarding the issue.

pomt-13392	Says Donald Trump "publicly invited Putin to hack into Americans’ (emails)."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/sep/26/hillary-clinton/hillary-clinton-claims-donald-trump-invited-russia/	Hillary Clinton said that Donald Trump gave Russian president Vladimir Putin the thumbs up to hack away at U.S. emails. Putin has "let loose cyber attackers to hack into government files, to hack into personal files, hack into the Democratic National Committee," Clinton said during the first general election presidential debate at Hofstra University. She continued: "But we will defend the citizens of this country, and the Russians need to understand that. I think they've been treating it as almost a probing, how far will we go? How much will we do? And that's why I was so shocked when Donald publicly invited Putin to hack into Americans. That is just unacceptable." We will fact-check whether Clinton is right about what Trump said about Putin and the emails. Trump’s comments about Russia hacking Clinton’s emails A Clinton campaign spokesman pointed us to Trump’s comments at a press conference at Trump National Doral golf course July 27. "Russia, if you’re listening, I hope you’re able to find the 30,000 emails that are missing," Trump said to a room full of TV cameras as well as reporters from the Miami Herald/Tampa Bay Times. "I think you will probably be rewarded mightily by our press." He also said: "By the way, they hacked -- they probably have her 33,000 e-mails. I hope they do. They probably have her 33,000 e-mails that she lost and deleted because you'd see some beauties there. So let's see." Clinton’s lawyers had turned over work-related emails but deleted thousands that she said were about personal matters. FBI Director James Comey said earlier that month that Clinton should have known that some of the emails stored on private servers in her New York home were classified, but concluded there wasn’t enough evidence that she intentionally mishandled classified information. Although the Justice Department declined to prosecute, Trump continued to hammer Clinton for the email controversy: "That gives me a big problem," Trump said in Doral. "After she gets a subpoena! She gets subpoenaed, and she gets rid of 33,000 emails? That gives me a problem. Now, if Russia or China or any other country has those emails, I mean, to be honest with you, I'd love to see them." When Katy Tur, an NBC reporter, asked Trump whether he was encouraging a foreign country to hack into emails, Trump snapped back: "Be quiet. I know you want to save (Clinton)." Trump also attacked the DNC over thousands of leaked emails published by WikiLeaks in July. Those emails showed its leaders — including party chair Debbie Wasserman Schultz of South Florida — favored Clinton over rival Bernie Sanders. Two days later Wasserman Schultz, a U.S. representative, announced she would step down from her party post. As for any invitation to Russia to hack emails, a Trump campaign spokesman told PolitiFact that Trump said he was being "sarcastic" in an interview that Fox News posted the next day. Trump told Fox News’ Brian Kilmeade, "You have to be kidding. His client, his person, deleted 33,000 emails illegally. You look at that. And when I’m being sarcastic with something ..." Asked by Kilmeade if he was indeed being sarcastic, Trump snapped, "Of course I'm being sarcastic." Our ruling Clinton says Trump "publicly invited Putin to hack into Americans’ (emails)." Trump said at a press conference in South Florida that he hoped Russia was able to find "the 30,000 emails that are missing." That was a reference to Clinton’s emails, not Americans’ emails more broadly.

pomt-01534	"57% of the jobs created" in Austin "from 2009 to 2013 do not pay families a living wage."	mostly true	/texas/statements/2014/sep/17/steve-adler/steve-adler-says-57-percent-jobs-added-2009-2013-d/	Austin isn’t as affordable as it needs to be, mayoral aspirant Steve Adler says on his campaign website, adding: "Our children cannot afford to live in the Austin where they grew up when they graduate and leave home. Even during a time of historic job growth, 57% of the jobs created from 2009 to 2013 do not pay families a living wage." We wondered about that percentage. By email, Adler’s campaign manager, Jim Wick, said Adler saw the figure in an April 26, 2014, Austin American-Statesman news analysis by Dan Zehr citing data compiled by Idaho-based Economic Modeling Specialists International, which analyzes workforce-related data. That story said that while the Austin metro area had gained thousands of jobs in recent years, inflation-adjusted earnings had fallen. Then came the declaration that drew Adler’s attention, which didn’t speak generally to families or to jobs in Austin alone. "From 2009 to 2013," the article said, "almost 57 percent of the newly created jobs in the area paid less than the living wage for a single parent with one child ($19.56 per hour), according to data from EMSI and the oft-cited living wage calculator created by researchers at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology." That living-wage figure, identical for Travis and Williamson counties, appears on web pages overseen by Amy Glasmeier, an MIT professor of economic geography and regional planning. According to the entries, the living wage is "the hourly rate that an individual must earn to support their family, if they are the sole provider and are working full-time (2,080 hours per year)." To our inquiry, Zehr provided a spreadsheet he built based on increases or decreases in jobs across more than 730 professions in the Austin-Round Rock Metropolitan Statistical Area, also showing the estimated median hourly wage for each of the professions. By email, EMSI spokesman Joshua Wright said its median hourly wage data came from the federal Bureau of Labor Statistics and that information was benchmarked to the firm’s own industry-by-industry data drawn from agencies like the BLS and U.S. Census Bureau. By our calculation, some 53,315 of the 92,620 net jobs added in the Austin area from 2009 to 2013, or 58 percent, had a median hourly wage less than the living wage for a single parent with one child. These lower-wage jobs encompassed 394 types of jobs including positions in oil, gas and mining as well as loan interviewers and clerks, pest control workers, skin-care specialists and medical secretaries, according to the spreadsheet. In reviewing these details, we also wondered if the outcomes for Austin workers were as dire as Adler said. For instance, the MIT website presents lower living wages including, for Travis and Williamson counties, $18.51 an hour for two adults and a child; $14.88 for two adults only; and $9.43 for one adult alone. If you focus on earnings at a lower living wage, in turn, you’re going to conclude more workers fared better. According to the spreadsheet, for instance, 40,560 of the 92,620 net jobs gained from 2009 to 2013, or 44 percent, had median hourly wages less than $14.88; 15,099 of the net jobs gained, 16 percent, had median hourly wages less than $9.43. It also occurred to us the median wage might not be a perfect way to gauge who exactly is earning enough to get by. That is, the median wage in each occupation is the boundary between the highest paid 50 percent and the lowest paid 50 percent of workers. It stands to reason, then, that some workers in the 57 percent still made more than the living wage for a single parent with a child. But it’s also so that some of the other 43 percent made less than the same living wage. The limits of public wage data evidently make it difficult to calculate a precise percentage. Next, for an independent look at this claim, we turned to Cynthia Osborne, a University of Texas associate professor and director of the Child and Family Research Partnership at the Lyndon B. Johnson School of Public Affairs. By email, Osborne told us the 57 percent figure might be right, but she’d need more information -- particularly the variations in wages around each median -- to reach a conclusion. EMSI’s Wright told us he didn’t have that type of information, but could share the wages for each occupation at specific points along the wage curve. Daniel Dillon, a research associate for the partnership, later said three interpolations drawing on this added detail basically confirmed about 57 percent of the jobs added in the Austin area didn’t pay the living wage for an adult with one child. Our ruling Adler said: "57% of the jobs created from 2009 to 2013 do not pay families a living wage." To be precise, that’s the estimated share of net jobs added in the multi-county Austin area (not Austin alone) pegged as having median wages less than the living wage for an adult with one child. Families vary in size, though, as do related living wages. We rate this statement, which lacks clarification, Mostly True.

pomt-08504	"I said no to these big bank bailouts."	true	/texas/statements/2010/oct/07/lloyd-doggett/us-rep-lloyd-doggett-says-he-voted-against-bank-ba/	In a TV ad that started airing Oct. 4, small-business owners applaud U.S. Rep. Lloyd Doggett, D-Austin, who boasts about his vote against the bank bailout package that has haunted some incumbents seeking re-election. When the U.S. House passed the legislation Oct. 3, 2008, most Democrats voted for it while a majority of Republicans said no. In the ad, Doggett says: "I said no to these big bank bailouts. We need to focus our resources on helping Central Texas, not Wall Street." We ran his claim through the Truth-O-Meter after a reader urged us to check it out. First, the big picture: In 2008, after a housing boom, the bubble burst when securities backed by risky mortgages contaminated the greater financial system. The markets tanked and the government scrambled to pick up the pieces. In September of that year, the government seized control of mortgage companies Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, which had funded more than two-thirds of recent home loans, investment bank Lehman Brothers went under, and the government swooped in to rescue insurance company American International Group. Amid uncertainty, and with the stock markets nosediving, U.S. Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson and Federal Reserve chairman Ben Bernanke proposed a sweeping $700 billion plan to bailout financial institutions. President George W. Bush and presidential candidates Barack Obama and John McCain supported Paulson's proposal, which called for the launch of the Troubled Asset Relief Program, or TARP, described as an effort to stabilize the economy by authorizing the treasury secretary to buy toxic assets, largely comprised of shaky mortgage-backed securities — essentially bad debts. Over the next three months, Paulson bolstered banks with $350 billion, according to an evolving summary of the credit crisis by The New York Times. Last month, the Times reported that the TARP bailout "could conceivably earn taxpayers a profit." However, "a final accounting of the government's full range of interventions in the economy, including the bailouts of the mortgage financial giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, is years off and will most likely remain controversial and potentially costly." At the time, constituents weren't keen on bailing out big banks and other financial institutions. "For most voters, TARP remains a four-letter word," according to the Times. Distrust was also simmering in Congress. On Sept. 30, 2008, the Austin American-Statesman reported that the day before, "three of the four U.S. House members from the Austin area broke with their party leaders Monday and voted against the rescue plan for the financial markets." Doggett joined Reps. Michael McCaul, R-Austin, and John Carter, R-Round Rock, in voting to defeat the rescue plan. San Antonio Rep. Lamar Smith, a Republican who represents part of Travis County, voted for the legislation. "In a sign of just how little weight President Bush carries in even his home state these days, just four of the 19 Texas Republicans in the House voted for his bailout plan," the Statesman reported. "Five of the 13 Texas Democrats voted for it. The local lawmakers voting no all said they wanted Congress to spend more time looking at different solutions to the financial crisis." Doggett had been meeting with William Isaac, who was chairman of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. under President Ronald Reagan, according to the Statesman. Isaac had suggested that the administration could mollify the markets by raising the limit on the amount of deposits insured by the FDIC, among other measures. Doggett said: "It strikes me that these are sensible steps that would address market concerns without such a huge cost to the taxpayer." A Statesman editorial published the same day observed that "you know a bill is in trouble when conservative Republican John Carter of Round Rock and liberal Democrat Lloyd Doggett of Austin both vote against it." The House killed that measure, 228-205, and the stock market further spiraled. Then, two days later, the Senate voted 74-25 in favor of a modified $700 billion bailout plan. The crux of the legislation was intended to stabilize the economy and prevent further disruption to the economic system by giving the government authority to purchase and insure certain types of troubled assets. At the time, House Minority Leader John Boehner, R-Ohio, said on Fox News that the Senate bill had a "much better chance" of making it through the House, according to an Oct. 2, 2008, Los Angeles Times news story. "I do think that the big (stock market) drop on Monday really had a chilling effect on a lot of our members and a lot of our constituents," he said. The Dow had plunged 800 points, according to a timeline of the crisis by The Washington Post. Doggett wasn't won over. "The Senate measure has changed my position from 'no' to 'heck no,'" he said, according to the Times. On the floor of the House Oct. 3, Doggett suggested the bailout was a rash, irresponsible use of taxpayer dollars. "What Bush demands on this subrprime lending debacle is for taxpayers to reward Wall Street with what is essentially the biggest subprime loan in American history," he said. "We cannot afford to give almost unlimited discretion to one man to determine what toxic securities to buy and on what terms. We should not bail out the entire world." The Senate approach cleared the House Oct. 3, 2008 by 263-171. In the Texas delegation, nine Democrats and six Republicans voted yes, while four Democrats and 13 Republicans voted no. The Texas delegates who switched votes between versions of the bailout — going from "no" to "yes" — were Al Green, D-Houston, Mike Conaway, R-Midland, Mac Thornberry, R-Clarendon, Sheila Jackson Lee, D-Houston, Solomon Ortiz, D-Corpus Christi, and Henry Cuellar, D-Laredo. Doggett was quoted in the Oct. 3 American-Statesman saying: "When markets are poisoned, you demand the best antidote to that poison ... not yield to President Bush's take-it-or-leave-it demand." So, Doggett twice voted against the TARP measure, the plan since widely called a "bailout." We rate his statement as True.	None	Lloyd Doggett	None	None	None	2010-10-07T18:10:21	2010-10-04	['None']
pomt-07302	"Wisconsin is one of the few states in the country that do not currently require a photographic identification" to vote.	false	/wisconsin/statements/2011/may/18/terry-moulton/state-sen-terry-moulton-says-wisconsin-one-few-sta/	As the Wisconsin Legislature took up a strict photo ID requirement for voting, Republicans responded to concerns that the bill was one of the most restrictive in the United States. Most didn't dispute that fact, saying it was a necessary anti-fraud measure. We previously rated as True a claim from Milwaukee Ald. Milele Coggs that "In its current state, this bill is the most restrictive voter ID legislation in the nation." Republicans did, however, make several changes that put in doubt whether it's still the most restrictive, or just one of the most restrictive. But in the weeks before the state Assembly approved the amended measure May 11, at least one photo ID backer in the state Senate put Wisconsin’s status in a totally different light. (The Senate was poised to give final approval to the bill on May 19, 2011.) State Sen. Terry Moulton, R-Chippewa Falls, answered constituent concerns with a letter that made this claim: "Wisconsin is one of the few states in the country that do not currently require a photographic identification." We heard from two Moulton constituents -- Gail Halmstad of Chippewa Falls and Jim Dunning of Eau Claire -- who said they received those Moulton letters between late March and mid-April. Both said they question the need for a photo ID mandate at the polls. Others, including state Sen. Alberta Darling, R-River Hills, have made similar statements. "I think most people just want to get the issue off the table and say, yeah, we should have an ID in order to vote. Most states have an ID for voting," Darling told a WTMJ-TV (Channel 4) reporter for a May 11, 2011 story. Darling didn’t say "photo" ID, so her statement can’t be equated with that of Moulton. But that’s what the bill requires and what she supports, so her comment may have left the impression with viewers that she meant most states have photo ID for voting. Moulton’s statement was simple and straightforward. So is our evaluation, since we have been down this road before. The definitive source for up-to-date information on state-by-state requirements for voter identification is the nonpartisan National Conference of State Legislatures’ online guide, "Voter Identification Requirements." So is it true that Wisconsin is one of the few states that lacks a photo ID rule for voting? Actually, it’s the opposite. Only eight states currently request or require a photo ID to vote, according to the group. A ninth state, Kansas, will require photo ID as of 2012, we found. (The Wisconsin law would take effect in 2012 as well, barring a court injunction.) Another 18 states require some form of identification, but it does not have to include a picture. That tally will move to 19 in July 2011 when Oklahoma election officials begin requesting photo ID, according to the group. These numbers could change more in the months ahead. According to Brennan Center for Justice research, 37 states including Wisconsin are considering or have considered voter ID and/or proof of citizenship legislation in recent months. But currently Wisconsin is in a very large group of states that do not require photo ID to vote -- not "one of the few" who do not. Most states do not ask or mandate photo ID. Moulton’s office told us they inadvertently erred in the constituent letter and have omitted the claim in letters that have gone out recently. Elise Nelson, an aide to Moulton, gave us a copy of the revised letter she said went out on May 10, and it does not include the earlier claim. But it does not correct it either, so recipients may still have the impression the earlier claim is fact. Nelson said she did not know where Moulton’s office came up with the original claim. The bottom line? As Wisconsin was on the verge of enacting a photo ID requirement for voting, Moulton said the state was one of only a few without one. But as senators prepared to cast their final vote, most states still do not require photo ID to vote. Moulton’s claim to constituents, as his office notes, was well off target. We rate it False.

pomt-00064	Says Scott Walker ‘cut $800 million from our schools.’	mostly false	/wisconsin/statements/2018/nov/02/tony-evers/democrat-tony-evers-misfires-education-spending-cl/	Schools have been front and center throughout the race for Wisconsin governor, which pits the state schools superintendent against a Republican governor who famously took on teachers’ unions. In one volley, Democrat Tony Evers zeroed in on school spending under Gov. Scott Walker. "Do you trust Scott Walker on education?" asks the TV ad, released Sept. 25, 2018. "He’s the politician who cut $800 million from our schools." That’s very similar to an Evers claim we fact-checked in April -- that Walker "has taken over a billion dollars from the public schools." We rated that Mostly False. Does the reduced figure change things? State aid dollars short of $800 million figure Evers’ team said the number in the ad referred to cuts in 2011-’13, under Walker’s first budget. Though much of that funding has since been restored, Evers spokesman Sam Lau argued that doesn’t make the claim less true -- and doesn’t lessen the impact of the reduction. "Each and every year of a student's education matters," Lau said in an email. "Scott Walker's $800 million cuts to Wisconsin's public schools were devastating and continue to be felt today." The state’s nonpartisan Legislative Fiscal Bureau provided numbers for our April fact check on this topic, and we’ll rely on those again. The chart below has a lot to take in, but we’ll focus on a couple numbers we’ve designated with asterisks. This looks at general purpose revenue (GPR) routed to schools, which includes per-pupil aid, equalization aid and other categorical aids. It starts with the 2010-’11 budget, the last one under Gov. Jim Doyle. That’s the baseline for the comparison. State fiscal year GPR school aids Change to prior year Change to 2010-’11 Cumulative change to 2010-’11 2010-’11 $5.27 billion 2011-’12 $4.85 billion -$426.5 million -$426.5 million -$426.5 million 2012-’13 $4.91 billion +$68.9 million -$357.6 million -$784.1 million* 2013-’14 $5.03 billion +$119.8 million -$237.8 million -$1.021 billion 2014-’15 $5.19 billion +$160.5 million -$77.3 million -$1.1 billion 2015-’16 $5.2 billion +$3 million -$74.3 million -$1.17 billion 2016-’17 $5.4 billion +$197.3 million +$123 million -$1.05 billion 2017-’18 $5.58 billion +$176.9 million +$299.9 million -$750.6 million 2018-’19 $5.84 billion +$267.1 million +$567 million -$183.6 million* The numbers do show a large drop when Walker first took office. The state had GPR school aid of $5.27 billion the last year under Doyle. The "cuts" Evers alleges come from comparing actual funding in the following two years to what funding would have been if it remained at that $5.27 billion level annually. The GPR school aids dropped by $426.5 million in 2011-’12 and then rose by $68.9 million in 2012-’13. Taken together, that reduced school aid by $784.1 million in the two-year budget. That’s in the ballpark of Evers’ claim, but it leaves out a lot of information. The missing pieces It’s critical to note the 2011-’12 funding reduction did not happen in isolation. Act 10, enacted in 2011, required public employees to pay more toward their pensions and decreased their collective bargaining power. That allowed schools to save money that would have gone toward employee pensions and to charge employees more for health insurance. When all districts were tallied in 2012, they spent $451.5 million less on employee benefits than in 2011, according to a study by the nonpartisan Wisconsin Taxpayers Alliance, now the Wisconsin Policy Forum. In 2013, benefits were $433.6 million less than in 2011. So across the two years where state funding was cut by nearly $800 million, school districts saved nearly $900 million in benefits. And that savings would be higher if you assume costs would have continued to rise from the 2011 levels (likely about 4.3 percent per year, according to the study). Another important factor: The Evers ad does not say it is referring to a funding change made more than five years ago in a single budget. Thus, viewers might assume school spending is $800 million less today than when Walker began. In reality, after the initial cuts, Walker has increased GPR school aids every year, hitting a high of $5.84 billion this year. That’s above the last year of Doyle’s term, though that doesn’t account for inflation. Those increases mean most of that $784 million in cuts has been returned to the budget. The right-hand column of the chart shows the difference between actual funding and what it would have been cumulatively if the schools budget remained $5.27 billion every year since 2011. That gap was more than $1 billion at one point but now is down to $183.6 million. Our rating In the ad, Evers claims Walker cut $800 million from schools. He did cut close to that ($784 million), in raw dollars in a single two-year budget. But that ignores changes made through Walker’s Act 10 that saved districts money. And the ad does not make clear that it’s referring only to cuts from 2011-’13, so viewers wouldn’t know that subsequent funding increases have made up most of that reduction. Our definition for Mostly False is "The statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression." That fits here.

pomt-12514	"We're experiencing a net outflow of illegal, undocumented workers from America back to Mexico."	true	/wisconsin/statements/2017/apr/26/ron-kind/yes-experiencing-net-outflow-illegal-undocumented-/	Candidate Donald Trump pledged to build a wall on the Mexican border, and he has taken steps to make that a reality as president. The push implies droves of outsiders are clamoring to make their way to America, but one Wisconsin congressman says a basic assumption behind that effort is wrong. "We're experiencing a net outflow of illegal, undocumented workers from America back to Mexico," U.S. Rep. Ron Kind, D-La Crosse, said Feb. 16, 2017 on Wisconsin Public Radio. "To build a wall now would be locking them in this country." Are there really more illegal Mexican immigrants going than coming? Research backs up claim There are no perfect statistics when it comes to illegal immigration — it’s inherently impossible to track accurately. But U.S. and Mexican government data analyzed by the Pew Research Center shows the immigration trend reversed in the last decade. The estimated number of Mexicans in the United States illegally rose steadily for many years, from 2.9 million in 1995 to a peak of 6.9 million in 2007. But the number began dropping in 2008 and has fallen more since, reaching 5.8 million in 2014, the latest year for which Pew analyzed data. If the number is falling, that means more illegal Mexican immigrants are leaving the United States than entering it. The numbers include both immigrants who entered the U.S. illegally and those who overstayed their visas. According to Pew, key factors in the decline are the Great Recession, which meant U.S. job losses in construction and other sectors where Mexican immigrants are likely to work; a rising number of deportations; and increasing numbers of U.S. Border Patrol agents. Immigration experts from a variety of think tanks said Pew’s research on illegal immigration is well respected and saw no reason to doubt its methodology. The change in migration patterns is also reflected in the number of apprehensions on the Mexican border by the U.S. Border Patrol. About 191,000 Mexicans were apprehended along the southern border in the 2016 fiscal year. At the peak of Mexican immigration in 2007, the Border Patrol apprehended 809,000 Mexicans. Overall, illegal immigration was largely static from 2009 to 2014, as the drop in Mexican immigration was mostly offset by an increase from other areas, such as Central America and Asia. (In 2014 the two regions combined for an estimated 3.2 million illegal immigrants, just over half the total from Mexico.) The overall number of illegal immigrants in the United States — from all countries of origin — held steady from 2009 to 2014 at around 11 million, Pew estimates. In 2014, the Border Patrol apprehended more non-Mexicans than Mexicans for the first time in at least 60 years, Pew reported. Mexicans still accounted for about 52% of illegal immigration in 2014, though. Our rating Kind said more unauthorized Mexican immigrants are returning to Mexico than coming into the U.S. Immigration data gathered by a respected group shows that is an accurate synopsis of the trend since 2007.

pomt-01992	Americans "invented the automobile."	false	/punditfact/statements/2014/jun/13/laura-ingraham/did-americans-invent-car-ingraham-says-so/	Americans have a reputation for ingenuity -- but it can be tempting to give more credit than is deserved. In a recent radio show, conservative talk-radio host Laura Ingraham responded to a caller who noted that in some jobs, immigrants outperform Americans. Ingraham sought to reframe the issue. "Americans won the war with our allies in World War II," Ingraham said. "Americans developed some of the most groundbreaking pieces of technology that the world has ever seen. We invented the automobile. We invented the airplane. Americans can do those jobs." There’s no doubt that the Wright brothers invented the airplane, and Henry Ford was a major player in making the car a global commercial success. But a listener to Ingraham's show was pretty sure that she was off the mark when she said Americans invented the automobile. The listener asked us to look into it, so we did. When we contacted University of Dayton automobile historian John Heitmann, he said the car’s roots are in Europe. "The automobile is European by birth, American by adoption," Heitmann said. "German inventors and French entrepreneurs led the way." The first patent for an internal combustion powered car -- a two-seater -- was filed on Jan. 29, 1886 by Karl Benz in Germany. Benz’s names lives on in the Mercedes-Benz brand. We also checked with John Lienhard, a professor of technology at the University of Houston. In a radio series on innovation, Lienhard said a few people actually built powered vehicles before Benz. For instance, Austrian engineer Sigfried Marcus invented the carburator for his first gas-powered car in 1864. Marcus built a second prototype sometime between 1875 and 1888. The car is owned today by the Austrian Automobile, Motorcycle and Touring Club in Vienna. Reportedly, it still runs. (A side note: When Nazi Germany annexed Austria, the Nazis tried to expunge all records of Marcus because he was Jewish. His car was hidden behind a false brick wall and "re-discovered" in 1949. Like a scene out of the Woody Allen movie Sleeper, it started up and was driven at the break-neck speed of about 3 mph.) Steam-powered cars date back even earlier -- to 1769 in France. Lienhard told PunditFact he shudders at having to figure out the question of who was "first," since the path to what we know today as the car included many zig-zags, incremental improvements and dead ends. He wrote a book, How Invention Begins, about the many efforts that ultimately produced the car we know today. Still, he offered a rule of thumb: Look at who had the first commercial success. By that standard, the nod goes to Benz. "He built a little three-wheeled car in 1885 and sold his first one two years later," Lienhard wrote. "He went into production with a four-wheeled model in 1890." We should note that America was not too far behind Benz. According to the University of Michigan’s Bentley Historical Library, William Morrison constructed an electric carriage that he drove through Des Moines, Iowa, in 1891. In 1893, Frank Duryea exhibited a motorized truck, using an internal combustion engine. The first sales to the American public took place in 1896. "Once we got into the game, we moved very fast," Lienhard said. "Our role in the development of the automobile was huge." Ingraham show producer Julia Hahn told us Ingraham was thinking of Americans’ early work in engine design. Our ruling Ingraham said that Americans invented the automobile. If we look at internal combustion-powered vehicles, all of the first examples come from Europe, and the first commercial enterprise emerged in Germany. America played a major role in automobile production, but Ingraham spoke specifically about an earlier stage -- invention. We rate the claim False.

pomt-10619	Says he passed a bill to stop a military requirement that wounded soldiers pay for meals and phone calls.	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/jan/16/barack-obama/his-bill-was-more-narrow/	During the Democratic debate in Las Vegas on Jan. 15, 2008, Sen. Barack Obama complained about "callousness" for wounded soldiers at Walter Reed Army Medical Center. "I went to Walter Reed to talk to the wounded warriors who had come back to discover that they were still paying for their meals and their phone calls while in Walter Reed, while rehabbing, which I could not believe," Obama said, referring to his April 2005 visit to the Washington, D.C., hospital. "And I was able to gain the cooperation of a Republican-controlled Senate at the time and pass a bill that would eliminate that." Obama is correct that his bill passed, but he gives the impression its scope was broader than it really was. It was actually Beverly Young, the wife of U.S. Rep. C.W. Bill Young of Indian Shores, Fla., who two years earlier called attention to the meal rules at Walter Reed. In the summer of 2003, she learned that the government was requiring wounded soldiers who were staying in the hospital to reimburse the government $8.10 per day for their food. The rule was based on a philosophy that soldiers would be double-dipping if they ate food at the hospital and got to pocket the $8.10. She and Rep. Young raised a fuss about the rule and said it was wrong to charge wounded soldiers for hospital food. Rep. Young said it was especially silly to charge because "the food probably isn't that good." The Youngs paid a $210 bill on behalf of Marine Staff Sgt. Bill Murwin, the first case the Youngs heard about, and Rep. Young introduced a bill to permanently end the rule. It passed in October 2003. Young's law applied to inpatient care at Walter Reed. In January 2005, the month that Obama joined the Senate, Salon.com published an article that said soldiers who were visiting Walter Reed for outpatient care were also being required to pay for their meals. About four months later, Obama visited Walter Reed and then introduced an amendment to a defense bill that expanded the definition of "hospitalized" soldiers to include those undergoing medical recuperation and therapy. Obama noted that the number of soldiers affected was "small" — about 4,000. His amendment passed the Senate in May 2005 with bipartisan support: Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., was one of the co-sponsors and it passed when Republicans controlled Congress. The meal portion was included in a final conference report that passed both chambers that month. Obama is correct that his bill passed and that it had Republican support. But at the Las Vegas debate, he gave the impression that its scope was broader than it was. Indeed, the main problem had been fixed two years earlier. So we find his statement Half True.	None	Barack Obama	None	None	None	2008-01-16T00:00:00	2008-01-15	['None']
pomt-02082	Says Hillary Clinton opposed an individual mandate and favored an employer mandate back in 1993.	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2014/may/21/bobby-jindal/was-hillary-clinton-against-individual-mandate-dur/	Louisiana Republican Gov. Bobby Jindal still thinks the Affordable Care Act is unworkable and he found an unlikely ally to help him criticize the law: Hillary Clinton. Before you stop the presses or get Wolf Blitzer ready in the Situation Room, there’s an important twist: Jindal was quoting Clinton from 1993. In an op-ed for Politico, Jindal rehashed his opposition to the individual mandate that requires most Americans to purchase health insurance, a key tenant of President Barack Obama’s health care law. And he noted that Clinton was once against it, too. "It is a well-known fact that Clinton came to strenuously support an individual health insurance mandate in her 2008 primary campaign against Barack Obama," Jindal wrote. "Less well-remembered, however, is that Clinton considered an employer mandate — not an individual mandate — the best way to achieve ‘universal coverage’ in her health care task force’s ill-fated 1993 proposal, put forth while she was first lady." Twenty years have passed since the Clintons’ unsuccessful attempt at health care reform, but hey, we live in the days when hologram Michael Jackson performs on stage. So maybe what’s old is new again, and a trip to the ’90s is just what we need. The Clintons go to Washington In 1993, Hillary Clinton led a task force created by her husband, President Bill Clinton, with the goal of reforming the health industry and providing care for most of the population. On Sept. 22, 1993, President Clinton gave a speech where he laid out his proposal based off the task force’s findings. Universal coverage, he said, could be achieved by requiring all employers to provide insurance to workers. First Lady Clinton then testified on the Hill for several days to explain and defend the plan before a handful of congressional committees. Clinton said that the administration settled on an employer mandate, rather than instituting a broad-based tax similar to Medicare, or an individual mandate, which a handful of Republicans had offered as a means of achieving universal coverage. We listened to several hours of Clinton’s testimony and read many news accounts from 1993. We can say with confidence that Jindal is right: Clinton opposed delivering universal coverage entirely through an individual mandate and supported an employer mandate instead. But Jindal also picks out a couple of Clinton’s concerns and tries to tie them to current events, as though her comments in 1993 foreshadowed Obamacare’s impact on the health care industry. Perhaps Clinton’s misgivings are relevant to today’s debate, but not how Jindal portrayed them. For example, as Jindal notes, Clinton testified she thought employers may see the individual mandate as an opportunity to forgo providing their employees insurance and push them instead to the new individual market. Jindal tries to link this comment to the millions of individuals who had their policies canceled last year due to minimum requirements in Obamacare (which, he notes, contributed to PolitiFact’s Lie of the Year). Clinton’s concerns, though, have nothing to do with what happened to those people. The millions who had their policies canceled or changed last year bought plans from an independent provider, not through their employer. Clinton also thought employers might feel pressure under an individual mandate to keep wages low so employees would qualify for government-paid subsidies to purchase insurance on the private market. Jindal wrote, "That sounds a lot like what the Congressional Budget Office concluded in February: that Obamacare will reduce the labor force by the equivalent of 2.3 million workers, because employers will not raise wages and individuals will choose not to work in order to retain access to government insurance subsidies." That’s not what exactly what the CBO said, as we’ve noted on multiple occasions. People aren’t leaving jobs as part of a ploy to make themselves eligible for subsidies. Rather, the CBO said that the availability of affordable insurance would make it possible for individuals to voluntarily cut back hours or quit jobs they stayed in only for the health insurance (like someone with a pre-existing condition who previously could not get coverage on the private market and was working just for the insurance). It’s worth noting, too, those weren’t Clinton’s only concerns. She also said that the existing private insurance system was heavily reliant on employer-provided coverage and an employer mandate would be the "least disruptive" and most familiar to people. Over the last two decades, though, fewer individuals are receiving health care benefits from their employer. It’s still a plurality of Americans, but it has dropped steadily. In 1997, nearly 65 percent of individuals bought their insurance through their employer; in 2010 it was 56.5 percent, the U.S. Census said, and continues to decline. Kaiser Family Foundation, the non-partisan health experts, estimates it’s down to 48 percent of the population. Clinton also worried that government couldn’t create a system to pull off the individual mandate. She had "great concerns about how the administrative structure to track the individual contribution, to collect it and to then connect it with health insurance would be set up." Such a system, she said, would be "extremely complicated and bureaucratic." The technology the Obama administration utilized (eventually) to create a new market for buying and selling private health insurance is inconceivable to anything Clinton could have imagined back when the World Wide Web was an infant. That may have assuaged some of her concerns about the bureaucratic and logistical hurdles. Though, as Obama can attest, even with the technology, it hasn’t been easy. Finally, we noticed Clinton wasn’t all that down on the individual mandate, an idea promoted by moderate Republicans like Sen. John Chafee, R-R.I. She said it was "in the same ballpark" as her plan because it was a means to universal coverage. It just wasn’t her prefered pathway. She was more critical of alternatives offered by conservative Democrats that did not include any mandates at all. Our ruling Jindal said that in supporting an employer health insurance mandate in 1993, Clinton opposed an individual mandate. We think readers would be wise to review the red flags we raised surrounding Jindal’s characterization of Clinton’s comments and how they apply to the current state of affairs. But when it comes to reciting history, Jindal is largely accurate. Clinton had serious misgivings about an individual mandate to buy health insurance, and strongly preferred an employer-based model. On that point, we give Jindal a Mostly True.	None	Bobby Jindal	None	None	None	2014-05-21T05:59:00	2014-05-13	['None']
pomt-03177	Americans spend more than $160 billion and 6 billion hours per year complying with the tax code.	true	/georgia/statements/2013/sep/04/tom-price/call-tax-overhaul-cites-high-cost-money-time/	How much time did it take you -- or your tax preparer -- to complete your taxes last year? A couple of hours? A few days? How about 6 billion hours! According to Georgia Congressman Tom Price, Americans spend that vast amount of time complying with the tax code each year. Not only that, he said, but the cost to comply with the tax code is also astronomical. In a couple of Twitter posts recently, Price, a Republican from Roswell, used the eye-popping figures to push for an overhaul of the tax code. "Americans spend $160+ billion per yr complying with the tax code. Visit http://TaxReform.gov & share your ideas to fix a broken tax code," one Price post said. It was followed by a second post:: "Americans spend 6 billion hrs per yr complying with the tax code. Follow @simplertaxes & join the fight for a simpler, pro-growth tax code." We know taxes and the federal tax code are tough and take time to understand. But 6 billion hours and $160 billion for compliance? Those numbers seemed extreme, and we decided to check them out. Tax reform has become a talking point that almost everyone can agree on, sort of like the declaration that ice cream is yummy. Politicos on both sides of the aisle have called for an overhaul of a tax system that many say is too complex and onerous for businesses and individuals. The broad goal is to simplify the code by eliminating or reducing tax breaks and using the additional revenue to lower tax rates across the board. Price is a senior member of the House Ways and Means Committee, the chief tax-writing committee in the House. He has been part of a Republican bloc that has argued for overhauling the tax code to not only lower tax rates but also broaden the tax base and eliminate loopholes. To illustrate the obstacle that the tax code has become, Price and several other politicos have used the figures the congressman used in his Twitter posts. For example, PolitiFact Oregon checked similar statements made by U.S. Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., who used the figures to promote his plan for simplifying the tax code. Wyden’s statement was rated True. The numbers cited by Price and Wyden can be traced to the Internal Revenue Service’s independent ombudsman, known as the National Taxpayer Advocate. The ombudsman, currently Nina E. Olson, is described as the voice of the taxpayer before the IRS and Congress. Olson leads the Taxpayer Advocate Service, an independent organization within the IRS, in helping taxpayers resolve problems with the IRS, as well as working for change in the agency and in the federal tax code. In a 2010 annual report to Congress, Olson said that taxpayers -- individuals and corporations -- spend about $163 billion annually to comply with the tax code, a sum equal to 11 percent of all the revenue the federal government collected. The cost of compliance was based on 2008 figures. The NTA says there is no correct methodology for quantifying the costs of compliance with the tax code. The $163 billion figure is based on what was spent on personal and business income taxes (5.6 billion hours) multiplied by the average hourly cost of a civilian employee ($29.18, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics). The calculations did not include time spent complying with requirements for employment, estate and gift, excise, and exempt organization taxes. The annual compliance cost estimate based on 2010 requirements grew to $168 billion, according to the NTA’s 2012 annual report. That 2012 annual report found that individual taxpayers and businesses spend about 6.1 billion hours a year complying with the filing requirements of the Internal Revenue code. That figure does not include millions of additional hours taxpayers spend responding to IRS notices or audits. Olson’s office arrived at that figure by multiplying the number of copies of each form filed for tax year 2010 by the average amount of time the IRS estimated it took to complete each form. The IRS estimates the average time burden for all taxpayers is 13 hours, with an average cost of $210 per return. This average includes four hours for actual tax form completion, six hours for recordkeeping, two more hours for tax planning and a miscellaneous hour. The authors of the NTA report admit that the figure for time spent complying with the tax code is difficult to accurately measure because the IRS has not kept up with technology improvements that have made the process more efficient. Since 2001, Olson’s office has found, Congress has made nearly 5,000 changes to the tax code, an average of more than one a day, and the code has reached almost 4 million words. "Individual taxpayers find return preparation so overwhelming that few do it on their own. Nearly 60 percent of taxpayers hire paid preparers, and another 30 percent rely on commercial software, with leading software packages costing $50 or more," Olson wrote. "In other words, taxpayers must spend money just to figure out how much money they owe." If tax compliance were an industry, Olson said, "it would be one of the largest in the United States." To sum up, U.S. Rep Tom Price said Americans are spending more than $160 billion and 6 billion hours each year complying with the federal tax code. The figures have been repeated by multiple interests seeking a comprehensive overhaul of the tax code. Prices’ figures, used in two Twitter posts, can be traced to the IRS’ independent ombudsman. Those figures, while difficult to quantify, have become the accepted standard for calculating compliance time and costs. We rate Price’s claim True.

pomt-11400	"For the sixth straight year, we have secured record funding for K-12 and state universities."	half-true	/florida/statements/2018/mar/23/rick-scott/rick-scott-says-k-12-state-university-funding-high/	Gov. Rick Scott bragged that his final state budget continues a trend of record funding for education. "For the sixth straight year, we have secured record funding for K-12 and state universities to ensure every student has the opportunity to receive a world-class education in Florida," Scott wrote in a letter to Florida Secretary of State Ken Detzner on March 16. Scott’s claim is at odds with Democrats and state educators who say the education budget doesn’t go far enough to cover classroom needs. The 2018-19 budget includes specific allotments for school safety and mental health programs in response to the Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School shooting. Given the heated debate, we wanted to take a closer look at Scott’s claim. As we’ve concluded in similar fact-checks, the state’s total K-12 education budget has indeed increased in raw dollars every year for the last six years. However, Scott is overstating the value of those dollars. The K-12 education budget has not topped pre-recession levels when adjusted for inflation. Breakdown of K-12 education funding The main source of money for K-12 education is the Florida Education Finance Program, or FEFP. By law, it’s a combination of state and local funding that is sometimes tweaked based on tax receipts and enrollment counts. Scott spokeswoman Kerri Wyland said the "record funding" for K-12 education is only in reference to the state contribution, not the total funds that factor in local contributions. But that was not clear from Scott’s comment. For the 2018-19 school year, the K-12 total budget is about $21.1 billion, or about $7,408 per student. (The state’s share is a little more than half of the total at $11.9 billion.) That’s the highest it’s ever been, and a jump of almost $500 million from the previous year. School officials around the state have not been pleased, however, because their hands are tied about how to spend most of it. A good chunk of the increase is dedicated for school safety and mental health initiatives. "The Legislature is touting ‘record’ funding for schools by counting money slated for safety and mental health, not for education," said superintendents from some of Florida’s largest school districts in a joint column for the Tampa Bay Times. "Their ‘record’ funding is all funneled into categorical funds and can only be used for certain purposes." With that point in mind, we dove into the budget and per-pupil spending trends (the past six years are in bold): Fiscal year Total K-12 state share Total K-12 funds K-12 enrollment Per-pupil spending 2007-08 $9.7 billion $18.7 billion 2.63 million $7,126 2008-09 $8.6 billion $17.9 billion 2.62 million $6,846 2009-10 $8.1 billion $18 billion 2.63 million $6,846 2010-11 $8.91 billion $18.2 billion 2.64 million $6,897 2011-12* $8.71 billion $16.6 billion 2.67 million $6,217 2012-13 $9.5 billion $17.2 billion 2.7 million $6,376 2013-14 $10.5 billion $18.3 billion 2.705 million $6,769 2014-15 $10.7 billion $18.9 billion 2.74 million $6,915 2015-16 $10.93 billion $19.7 billion 2.77 million $7,105 2016-17 $11.3 billion $20.2 billion 2.8 million $7,196 2017-18 $11.6 billion $20.6 billion 2.82 million $7,307 2018-19 $11.9 billion $21.1 billion 2.9 million $7,408 * Scott’s first budget. In sheer dollars, Scott’s claim about K-12 schools is accurate. Overall, state and per-pupil funding has increased every year since fiscal year 2013-14 in K-12 schools. Per-pupil spending is a crucial measure, because it shows how much is spent on each student. It would be expected, then, that overall spending would increase with the number of students. There are approximately 200,000 more K-12 students today then six years ago in fiscal year 2013-14. Scott’s boast of record funding, however, does not hold up when adjusted for inflation. Using the federal Consumer Price Index calculator, we found per-pupil spending is not as high as it was before the recession crippled state tax revenues. K-12 per-pupil spending would have to be more than $8,726 in 2018-19 to match the 2007-08 level. Instead it is more than $1,000 short. State university funding Scott’s boasts of education spending over the years have not usually included state funding for universities. Scott’s office provided the total operating budgets for state universities in the six years he mentioned, but we were unable to find per-pupil and enrollment totals for the more recent school years. The university budgets grew each year, from $3.48 billion in 2013-14 to $4.37 billion from 2018-19. During that time, the system also added more students. The Board of Governors, which oversees the State University System, offered enrollment totals and per-pupil spending for this period, using a slightly different methodology to calculate the overall operating funds. The spending totals reported by the board are slightly less than the figures cited by Scott. (One explanation could be that the governor’s data includes tuition assistance.) Still, they speak to the trend of increased record spending. The same caveats we found with K-12 education also apply: Per-pupil spending in 2018-19 would have to be roughly $14,346 to match the 2007-08 level. We did not find a per-pupil spending for 2018-19, but it’s safe to say that the per-pupil amount would be very close to the spending power in 2007-08. Fiscal year General revenue and lottery subtotal Enrollment Per-pupil spending 2007-08 $3.04 billion 259,528 $11,716 2008-09 $2.9 billion 259,972 $11,407 2009-10 $2.9 billion 268,052 $11,015 2010-11 $3.1 billion 276,376 $11,324 2011-12* $2.9 billion 293,660 $10,162 2012-13 $2.9 billion 294,005 $9,906 2013-14 $3.5 billion 293,517 $11,957 2014-15 $3.8 billion 294,785 $12,764 2015-16 $3.9 billion 299,486 $13,047 2016-17 $4.1 billion 305,690 $13,459 2017-18 $4.28 billion 311,430 $13,752 2018-19 $4.3 billion* No data No data Source: Board of Governors, State Funding History for the SUS *Governor’s office estimate Our ruling Scott said, "For the sixth straight year, we have secured record funding for K-12 and state universities." Scott has a point in terms of sheer dollars. However, Florida's K-12 education funding hasn’t kept up with pre-recession numbers. We don't have a complete view of state university spending, but it's likely per-pupil spending is roughly the same as pre-recession numbers. And the bulk of this year’s K-12 education budget increase is strictly for school safety and mental health, which won’t leave a lot of money left over for classroom needs. We rate this Half True.

pomt-02826	"Under Mayor Cicilline, [Providence] was a sanctuary city."	false	/rhode-island/statements/2013/nov/24/john-depetro/talk-show-host-john-depetro-says-providence-was-sa/	Though it isn’t generating the political heat it did five years ago, immigration is still a hot-button talk radio issue. It resurfaced Oct. 21, 2013, when WPRO talk show host John DePetro was interviewing Brett Smiley, who plans to run for mayor of Providence. DePetro asked Smiley what he’d do as mayor about the number of "illegal aliens" in the city, and then said that "under Mayor [David] Cicilline, it [Providence] was a sanctuary city. He and the chief at the time, Dean Esserman, they wouldn’t cooperate with ICE regarding illegals in the city." The sanctuary city charge has been aimed at Cicilline, now a U.S. representative, before. Brendan Doherty, Cicilline’s Republican opponent in the 2012 congressional election, claimed during that campaign that Cicilline "espoused" Providence as a sanctuary city. We found no evidence that Cicilline ever took that position and ruled Doherty’s claim False. We wondered whether DePetro’s phrasing was more on the mark. DePetro said he based his statement on what he views as Providence’s begrudging-at-best cooperation with federal Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials. He said a prime example of that was the handling of a 2008 rape by Marco Riz, a Guatemalan man who was in the country illegally. Riz, who kidnapped a woman in Warwick and assaulted her in Providence’s Roger Williams Park, is serving a 30-year sentence. The Providence police had picked Riz up on a misdemeanor charge months before the rape and released him, even though he had previously been ordered deported by an immigration judge. In news accounts at the time, the Providence police and ICE each found reason to blame the other for the mistake. Providence police said they’d checked a national warrant database and found no warrants for Riz. They said they’d faxed a copy of his arraignment form to ICE and the agency never responded. ICE officials said Providence police should have contacted the agency’s Vermont office to check Riz’s status, and if they had, they’d have found about about the deportation order. (Now, instead of faxing reports, Providence police electronically transmit arrested suspects’ fingerprints to the attorney general’s office, which automatically adds them to national databases that ICE monitors, said Providence police spokeswoman Lindsay Lague and attorney general spokeswoman Amy Kempe .) So what about DePetro’s claim? The phrase "sanctuary city" gets tossed around a lot when immigration policy is being discussed, but even experts have a hard time defining it. During a congressional hearing in 2007, then-Secretary of Homeland Security Michael Chertoff observed, "you know, people use the term sanctuary city in different ways, so I’m never quite sure what people mean." Some have applied the term to cities such as New Haven, Conn., where the city issues its own identity cards regardless of immigration status, cards that can be used to get city services or open bank accounts. Or Takoma Park, Md., where residents who are not citizens of the United States have been allowed to vote in local elections since 1993. Or San Francisco, where the city and county have ordinances that specifically forbid city employees from helping ICE unless ordered to by federal or state law or a warrant. Or Cook County, Ill., where the county commissioners voted not to honor ICE requests to hold prisoners unless ICE was willing to pay for their incarceration. It also ordered that, absent a criminal warrant, county law enforcement personnel were not to expend time responding to ICE inquiries. Providence had none of those measures under Mayor Cicilline, nor does it now. In 2007, then-City Councilman Miguel Luna proposed an ordinance that would have specifically declared Providence a "sanctuary city." It never made it out of the Ordinance Committee for a vote. While Cicilline was mayor, however, the city resisted then-Gov. Donald Carcieri’s efforts to enlist municipalities in immigration enforcement. But Providence continued to notify federal ICE officials when it arrested suspected illegal immigrants and was never cited for failure to cooperate by the federal government. Our ruling John DePetro said that under Mayor David Cicilline, Providence "was a sanctuary city." While there is no legal definition of "sanctuary city," in the eight years that Cicilline was mayor Providence had not taken any of the measures adopted by other cities often identified by that label. We rule DePetro’s statement False. (Get updates from PolitiFactRI on Twitter. To comment or offer your ruling, visit us on our PolitiFact Rhode Island Facebook page.)

pomt-13260	"In exchange for five minutes with Bill Clinton, the government of Qatar was going to give $1 million to the Clinton Foundation."	mostly true	/global-news/statements/2016/oct/16/mike-pence/did-qatar-promise-clinton-foundation-1-million-fiv/	Mike Pence, emphatically denying allegations of sexual assault against Donald Trump, protested that the media hasn’t applied the same scrutiny to Hillary Clinton. On NBC’s Meet the Press, Pence said the media has paid more attention to the "unsubstantiated" charges against Trump than the real revelations about Clinton’s wrongdoings at the State Department. "The national media is ignoring an avalanche of real, hard evidence of corruption during the years of the Clinton administration. The New York Times just a few minutes ago posted a story about — in exchange for five minutes with Bill Clinton, the government of Qatar was going to give $1 million to the Clinton Foundation," Pence said Oct. 16, 2016. We wanted to fact-check Pence’s claim about Qatar and its $1 million donation. We found that Pence is largely accurate in his description of the New York Times account. The New York Times article, published Oct. 15, details an email to Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta, obtained by Wikileaks. (The Clinton camp has yet to confirm or deny the leak’s authenticity.) Amitabh Desai, the Clinton Foundation’s foreign policy director, emailed three Clinton Foundation employees and Doug Band, Bill Clinton’s personal aide on April 16, 2012, about his meetings with ambassadors from Qatar and a few other foreign countries. Hillary Clinton served as secretary of state from 2009 to 2013. "Qatar — Would like to see WJC (William Jefferson Clinton) for ‘five minutes’ in NYC, to present $1 million check that Qatar promises from WJC’s birthday in 2011," Desai wrote. "Qatar would welcome our suggestions for investments in Haiti — particularly on education and health. They have allocated most of their $20 million but are happy to consider projects we suggest. I'm collecting input from CF Haiti team." So the government of Qatar was going to give the Clinton Foundation $1 million as part of a five-minute meeting, according to this email. But Pence could have been more accurate in his description. Pence said Qatar "was going to" make a $1 million donation in exchange for a five-minute meeting. But according to Desai’s email, Qatar had promised the check for Bill Clinton’s birthday the previous year. The meeting was to present the check. Second, it’s not clear if the Qatari ambassador ever got his "five minutes" with the former president. Foreign government contributions to the Clinton Foundation have been the subject of much criticism lobbed against the Clintons. While they are legal, questions have been raised over possible conflicts of interest for Hillary Clinton while she was serving as secretary of state. As part of a memorandum of understanding between the Clinton Foundation and the Obama administration, the foundation agreed to (among other things) disclose material increases from foreign donors and roll back foreign donations altogether to its global health initiative. A State Department spokesperson told the New York Times that it does not have "a record of submission" from the Clinton Foundation on a 2012 donation from Qatar. A Clinton Foundation spokesman told us the 2012 donation was disclosed on its website. The Qatari government has given cumulatively between $1 million to $5 million to the Clinton Foundation from 2002 to 2016. The country is controversial for its treatment of women and the LGBT community, and has been accused of being a sponsor of terrorism. Our ruling Pence said, "In exchange for five minutes with Bill Clinton, the government of Qatar was going to give $1 million to the Clinton Foundation." The New York Times story shows that Qatar had promised $1 million to the Clinton Foundation for Bill Clinton’s birthday in 2011, and the Qatari ambassador requested five minutes with Bill Clinton to present the check the following year. It’s unclear of the meeting ever took place.

pomt-07715	"We have lost 600,000 jobs over the period of the last 10 years. Only Michigan and California have done worse."	true	/ohio/statements/2011/mar/04/john-kasich/gov-john-kasich-says-only-california-and-michigan-/	Jobs were the leading issue in Ohio's 2010 election campaign, and the issue has lost none of its importance or utility to officeholders. Gov. John Kasich brought it up twice in two days in interviews on CNN. The first-term Republican cited the state's loss of jobs among the reasons he backed Senate Bill 5, which would eliminate collective bargaining rights for state employees. "We have lost 600,000 jobs over the period of the last 10 years," Kasich said. "Only Michigan and California have done worse." We thought that was worth checking, especially because employment figures are estimates, measured several different ways. The Current Population Survey (CPS) is based on household interviews conducted each month by the U.S. Census Bureau for the Bureau of Labor Statistics. It counts employed individuals, and its data is used in calculating unemployment. The monthly Current Employment Statistics (CES) survey uses payroll records and counts unique jobs. Normally the headline jobs figure, it is preferred by the Congressional Budget Office and Bureau of Labor Statistics for measuring job growth. According to the CES survey and the Bureau of Labor Statistics, there were 5,002,900 jobs in Ohio in December 2010. Ten years earlier, in December 2000, the number was 5,613,000. That's a loss of about 610,000 jobs -- and the decline is even larger from the peak level of 5,638,100 jobs in May 2000. Kasich had Ohio's number right. But was it the nation’s third worst? California, which had 13,897,100 jobs in December 2010, lost 803,000 jobs from December 2000, and 1,305,500 jobs from the state’s peak level of July 2007, according to the CES survey. Michigan had 3,831,500 jobs in December 2010, a loss of 832,800 from December 2000. Kasich was correct that both states lost more jobs than Ohio from the start to the finish of the decade ending last December. No other states lost more by that measure. But there’s a footnote we’ll also add about boom-or-bust Florida, which qualifies as both a gainer and a loser. The state gained about 30,000 jobs from December 2000 to December 2010, when it had 7,193,900 in the CES survey. From its peak level of March 2007, however, Florida has lost 876,500 jobs -- more than any state except California. But for purposes of the Truth-O-Meter, words matter. Kasich’s statement was that over the last 10 years, Ohio lost 600,000 jobs and that only Michigan and California have done worse. And in terms of net change over the decade, he’s right on the money. We rate his statement as True.	None	John Kasich	None	None	None	2011-03-04T06:00:00	2011-02-22	['Michigan', 'California']
pomt-12408	"Donald Trump praises Colonel Sanders for his service in the Civil War."	pants on fire!	/punditfact/statements/2017/may/23/theredshtickcom/trump-calling-kfcs-col-sanders-civil-war-hero-was-/	A story that said President Donald Trump praised Kentucky Fried Chicken’s founder for saving Civil War troops from starvation at Valley Forge flunks the truth test. Let’s do our own history lesson here: A May 2, 2017, post at TheRedShtick.com carried the headline, "Donald Trump praises Colonel Sanders for his service in the Civil War." The story was flagged by Facebook as being potentially fake, as part of the social media site’s efforts to combat fake news. The story played off a controversial comment Trump made on May 1 about former President Andrew Jackson, whom Trump readily admires. During an interview on Sirius XM’s P.O.T.U.S. channel, Trump told the Washington Examiner's Salena Zito, "I mean, had Andrew Jackson been a little bit later you wouldn't have had the Civil War. He was a very tough person, but he had a big heart. He was really angry that he saw what was happening with regard to the Civil War, he said, 'There's no reason for this.' " Trump drew criticism for the incident because his words neglect the fact that Jackson was a slave owner. TheRedShtick.com used an excerpt from a May 1 New York Times story about the flap, then went off on its own invented tangent. The post said Trump told their intern, Dave Robicheaux, that Col. Harland Sanders, the founder of the Kentucky Fried Chicken restaurant chain, was a "tremendous Civil War hero." "Trump, a noted fan of Kentucky Fried Chicken, explained how Col. Sanders took five loaves of Evangeline Maid bread and two chickens, added his secret blend of 11 herbs and spices, and turned these humble ingredients into delicious meals that lasted an entire winter," the post read. "Robicheaux attempted to explain to Trump that Col. Sanders was born 25 years after the end of the war, that The Donald seemed to be confusing the food incident with a Biblical story about Jesus feeding the multitudes, and that Valley Forge was neither an encampment nor a battle site during the Civil War." It should be pretty obvious that this story is more than a bit contrived, starting with the name of the post’s author, Manny Schewitz. (For the record, Trump does like the occasional KFC bucket.) People coming to the story would certainly realize the post is fake if they visited the web pages’ About Us section. It says TheRedShtick.com is "a bold and engaging source of satire and irreverent humor." It said the site is a digital descendant of the defunct Red Shtick Magazine, formerly "the only print satirical publication in Louisiana’s capital city" of Baton Rouge (French for Red Stick). The print magazine ended in 2012, the site said. There is a RedShtickMagazine.com, that carries similar graphics to TheRedShtick.com, but the two sites post different content. The magazine site appears to carry unrelated, intermittent blog posts about Thailand-centric issues and events, as far as we can tell. Neither site makes its registration information public, but TheRedShtick.com publisher Jeremy White told us the publication once used the magazine’s domain name, but gave it up after going digital. As for the Sanders story, White said that it should be obvious that it’s fabricated, but these days satire can be difficult to distinguish from reality. "We earnestly endeavor to distinguish ourselves from peddlers of fake news — devoid of any real humor or any attempt to speak truth to power — who publish their fiction under the guise of satire," White said. "They only muddy our national discourse in the pursuit of easy clicks." Either way, Facebook readers should flag TheRedShtick.com as a satirical website and avoid it as a news source.

pomt-02030	Says Hillary Clinton "laid the groundwork" for getting chemical weapons out of Syria.	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2014/jun/04/claire-mccaskill/claire-mccaskill-says-hillary-clinton-secretary-st/	Despite a rocky past with the Clintons, Sen. Claire McCaskill was one of the first Democrats to jump on the 2016 Hillary for President bandwagon. And she sits on the Senate Armed Services and Homeland Security committees. So when Fox News Sunday was looking for someone to defend Hillary Clinton’s record as Secretary of State, who better than the Missouri Democrat? Host Chris Wallace contended that Clinton has a less-than-impressive resume from her time at the State Department. Wallace said Clinton "defended Syria President Bashar al-Assad as a possible reformer at the start of that country’s civil war." (Our partners at PunditFact rated that Half True.) McCaskill later retorted that Clinton actually played a key role in the Syrian conflict. "We're getting the chemical weapons out of Syria," McCaskill said. "She laid the groundwork for that." The agreement the United States reached with Assad to turn over Syria’s stockpile of chemical weapons came in September 2013 — seven months after Clinton stepped down as Secretary of State. As we suspected, McCaskill’s claim is rather dubious. Civil war Antigovernment protests in Syria began in March 2011. At the time, Clinton was Secretary of State. In the early stages of the conflict, Clinton and the administration called for a peaceful transition to democracy, and in August 2011, Obama said Assad should step down. But the Syrian conflict continued to escalate into an all-out civil war. Throughout the crisis, the United States was concerned about the chemical weapons in Syria — not only Assad’s use of them on his own people but protecting them from falling into the wrong hands if Assad should be overthrown. In August 2012, President Barack Obama spoke to reporters in the White House and first used the term "red line" regarding Assad’s chemical weapons. "A red line for us is we start seeing a whole bunch of chemical weapons moving around or being utilized," he said, later adding there would be "enormous consequences." McCaskill’s office noted that Clinton met with Russian and United Nations officials in December 2012 about the conflict. Before the meeting, she spoke with reporters and said "we’ve made it very clear what our position is with respect to chemical weapons," reiterating Obama’s red line. McCaskill spokesman John LaBombard added that "the current efforts to remove chemical weapons benefited from her hard work." That "may or may not be true," said Anthony Arend, cofounder of the Institute for International Law & Politics at Georgetown, "but, in any case, it's not the same as laying a foundation for the current agreement." The December 2012 meeting with Clinton and Russia did not result in any accord with Syria, nor did her negotiations prevent Assad from using chemical weapons. She left two months later in February 2014, when Sen. John Kerry won confirmation for the position from the Senate. And a lot happened after Clinton’s departure that make it hard to link her to the eventual weapons deal, experts told us. For starters, the administration’s position on what the "red line" actually meant continued to change after Clinton left office. When he first said it, Obama did not explain what the "enormous consequences" would be. In April 2013, the White House first told senators that the international community had evidence of chemical weapons use. By June, the Obama administration concluded Assad’s regimes used chemical weapons and authorized the military to provide light arms and ammunition to Syrian rebels. It wasn’t until Aug. 31, 2013, that Obama, citing Assad’s use of chemical weapons, called for congressional authority to take military action against Syria. "If anything, this red line that the Obama administration proclaimed was very fluid. It kept moving," said Danny Postel, associate director of the Center for Middle East Studies at the University of Denver. "It wasn’t until the critical weeks of the big chemical weapons attack that finally triggered the Obama administration to threaten actual military strikes on the Assad regime. Hillary Clinton was already gone by this point." It was that policy shift and threat of military action that ultimately seemed to move Assad to take action. The accidental agreement Experts also noted how quickly and spontaneously the deal to remove Assad’s chemical weapons was reached between the U.S., Syria and Russia. In many ways, Kerry almost "stumbled" into the agreement, said Joshua Landis, director of the Center for Middle East Studies at Oklahoma University and author of the Syria Comment blog. During a visit to London, a reporter asked Kerry about Assad’s interview with PBS’ Charlie Rose, where the leader would not even admit to having chemical weapons. "Is there anything at this point that his government could do or offer that would stop an attack?" the reporter asked. Kerry responded: "Sure. He could turn over every single bit of his chemical weapons to the international community in the next week. Turn it over, all of it, without delay, and allow a full and total accounting for that. But he isn't about to do it, and it can't be done, obviously." A State Department spokesman even said later that day that the offer was made "rhetorically." But within hours of Kerry’s remarks, Russia responded that Syria was receptive to such an agreement. On Sept. 10, Syria admitted to its chemical weapons stockpile and four days later joined the Chemical Weapons Convention and agreed to eliminate its weapons. About 90 percent of those weapons have been turned over since then. We took this analysis to McCaskill for rebuttal but they didn’t respond on the record. A State Department spokeswoman declined to comment, and Clinton’s spokesman did not respond to repeated emails. Our ruling McCaskill said Clinton "laid the groundwork" to remove Syria’s chemical weapons. The connection to the eventual deal seems to be Clinton’s ongoing discussions with Russia, who eventually helped broker the agreement, and the administration’s red line on chemical weapons, which eventually led to the threat of military action that forced Assad’s hand. Experts we spoke with said that was a pretty flimsy case. Obama’s red line changed meaning from Clinton to Kerry. At first it was a rather ambiguous threat. Later, crossing it meant helping rebels obtain weapons and finally the announcement of military action. Further, the eventual agreement itself came quickly and almost unintentionally after Kerry made a rhetorical offer that Russia and Assad accepted. Clinton had been out of the Secretary of State job for seven months at that point. Prior to Kerry’s offer, an agreement seemed out of reach. Given all of that, we rate McCaskill’s statement Mostly False.	None	Claire McCaskill	None	None	None	2014-06-04T17:26:18	2014-06-01	['Syria']
pomt-01537	"More than three women per day lose their lives at the hands of their partners."	true	/punditfact/statements/2014/sep/16/james-brown/cbs-sports-james-brown-more-3-women-day-are-killed/	Advocates for victims of domestic violence say the one good thing to come out of the Ray Rice scandal is more Americans are aware of just how big of a problem this is -- and it’s not limited to the NFL. CBS Sports announcer James Brown touched on this in a 90-second monologue directed to all men during the Sept. 11 pregame broadcast of Thursday Night Football, which coincidentally featured Rice’s former team, the Baltimore Ravens, against the Pittsburgh Steelers. Brown urged men to learn "what healthy, respectful manhood is all about" and to "give help or to get help, because our silence is deafening and deadly." Then he pulled out a stirring statistic. "Consider this: According to domestic violence experts, more than three women per day lose their lives at the hands of their partners," Brown said. "That means that since the night Feb. 15 in Atlantic City (the night Ray Rice hit now-wife Janay Rice on the elevator) more than 600 women have died." The figure is used across several outreach group websites, including Futures Without Violence, the Domestic Abuse Shelter of the Florida Keys, the National Network to End Domestic Violence and the Arkansas Coalition Against Domestic Violence. Experts say the claim is accurate. While the veracity of crime statistics in general can be questioned due to underreporting by victims and mislabeling by the investigating officer, murder statistics are reliable, experts say. The biggest repository for national crime statistics is the FBI’s annual Uniform Crime Report, which is based on data collected from local law enforcement agencies. Callie Rennison is a University of Colorado Denver public affairs professor who analyzes crime trends. Crunching federal figures, Rennison found 3.3 women died at the hands of their intimate partners per day in 2010. To get that figure, she divided the number of intimate partner homicides with female victims (1,192) by the number of days in the year. More than three days a day is alarmingly high, but it’s also down from a recent high of 4.2 deaths per day in 1993. Rennison did not run a similar calculation for the most recent years available, 2011 and 2012, but the trend holds. Of course, this is a daily average and not an exact representation of how many women are killed by their current or former partners. "So strictly scientifically speaking, it is a risk to estimate how many people have been killed in domestic violence incidents since Feb. 15," said Mary Koss, University of Arizona public health professor. "However, doing so is not fundamentally wrong and crime experts do it frequently." Because the number of male victims in intimate partner homicides is much lower, so too is the daily average. There were 305 of these deaths in 2010, which amounts to a daily average of 0.84. James Fox, a Northeastern University criminology professor, sliced the data differently for his own count of intimate partner homicides. He factored in unsolved homicide cases believed to have involved intimate partners. The result: slightly higher deaths per year. Using his numbers,the daily average of female deaths was 3.84 in 2010, 3.61 in 2011, and 3.68 in 2012. Brown could have been a touch more precise with his wording by saying "partners and former partners" instead of just "partners," but Rennison says that level of distinction is probably more important to academics. "Generally when we talk in our field (about FBI or Bureau of Justice Statistics figures), we’re talking about current or former spouse, girlfriend or boyfriend, and it can include same-sex partners as well," she said. Our ruling Brown implored the NFL community and beyond to consider a shocking statistic: "According to domestic violence experts, more than three women per day lose their lives at the hands of their partners." He went on to estimate how many women have been killed by their partners since the day Rice attacked his now-wife in an elevator -- a practice experts said isn’t scientifically precise but is a common practice. As for the three-deaths-a-day figure itself, experts said it is accurate. By some measures, the daily average is actually closer to four deaths. There are some ways that Brown could have been more precise, but they do not obscure his point. So we rate his claim True.	None	James Brown	None	None	None	2014-09-16T16:40:08	2014-09-11	['None']
pomt-01685	Says Charlie Crist rode on a jet that "belongs to a serial polluter with a history of environmental violations fined nearly $2 million for polluting water."	true	/florida/statements/2014/aug/15/republican-party-florida/charlie-crist-used-jet-owned-serial-polluter-rpof-/	Gov. Rick Scott’s campaign has focused on painting the Republican incumbent as a friend of the environment, which means attempting to show Democratic challenger Charlie Crist isn’t. A Republican Party of Florida commercial released Aug. 7, 2014, lambasts Crist for taking a supporter’s personal aircraft to a press event. "On his way to an event about -- get this -- green issues, Crist cruised in on a private jet," the narrator says. "That’s rich. What’s richer? The jet belongs to a serial polluter with a history of environmental violations fined nearly $2 million for polluting water." That certainly sounded like fodder for headlines, but was it true? PolitiFact Florida attempted to pull the permits on this one and find out what happened. Campaign development The state GOP told PolitiFact the commercial stemmed from a plane ride Crist took from Gainesville to Tallahassee on July 25. While Scott uses his personal jet to attend events and has been criticized for a lack of transparency surrounding its use, Crist has often used private planes to help him get to events around the state. This time the Scott campaign took a photo of the 2005 Cessna 560XL’s tail number and traced its ownership. The owner turned out to be James Finch, a Lynn Haven contractor who owns Phoenix Construction Services Inc., a company previously fined for environmental infractions. That was especially problematic for the flight in question, since Crist was attending a climate change lecture by Florida State University oceanography professor Jeff Chanton. Finch, a former NASCAR team owner, has a long history of political donations, giving tens of thousands of dollars to the Republican Party of Florida and John McCain’s presidential campaign. He also has a history of facing fines from the federal Environmental Protection Agency and the Florida Department of Environmental Protection. While neither agency responded to PolitiFact Florida’s requests for documentation of Finch’s penalties, we were able to do a little digging on our own. On two occasions, in 1984 and 1996, he was cited for backfilling the bayou at his home. No action was taken on the first instance, but he was forced to pay a penalty and do restoration work on the second. A 1998 complaint about destruction of seagrass and another notice about a potential sewage spill at a Millville wastewater treatment plant were withdrawn for lack of evidence. His company Phoenix Construction Services was fined $23,000 by the EPA after filling in wetlands at a Panama Beach park against the terms of the project’s U.S. Army Corps of Engineers permit in 1999. Fill dirt is considered by law to be a pollutant in "navigable wetlands." The Army Corps of Engineers issued a noncompliance notice after the company installed a portion of a sewage pipeline across St. Andrew Bay above ground against permitting guidelines. Finch’s company was cleared when the work was corrected per DEP guidelines by 2005. The truly epic saga, however, was Phoenix’s botched work at the Northwest Florida Beaches International Airport, which opened north of Panama City in 2010. Crist in 2007 called the airport "a national model for economic transformation and environmental preservation." Environmental groups had complained in 2009 that because of poor construction methods, the site was resulting in "pollution in Burnt Mill Creek, Crooked Creek, West Bay and the surrounding wetlands." Later that year, Phoenix was fined $1.7 million by the DEP for environmental permit violations. The agency concluded the contractor did not follow stormwater runoff plans or erosion stabilization methods, allowing improperly filtered water to flow into nearby wetlands. As costs wildly overran, Phoenix and the airport authority first sued each other, then banded together to sue other parties working on the project before settling in 2012. Phoenix did not return PolitiFact Florida’s request for comment. Phoenix continued to do work for the local government, though. The Bay County Commission in 2013 gave Phoenix a $25 million contract to build the county a water pumping station. The Crist campaign said the former governor didn’t know about the environmental fines against Finch. They said Crist hasn't used the plane since July 27. The Scott campaign shouldn't be too quick to point fingers at Finch for pollution fines, however. Finch worked on the airport with Charles W. "Chuck" Roberts III, a Panhandle paving contractor whose company was accused of improperly building a parking lot in that project. The airport authority was eventually blamed for not securing the proper permit. C.W. Roberts Inc. plants in several counties have been cited for leaking or improperly storing chemicals or being in disrepair. Many of the company’s infractions did not result in penalties. What is Roberts doing now? In 2011, Gov. Scott appointed him to a seat on the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission. Our ruling The Republican Party of Florida said Crist rode on a jet that "belongs to a serial polluter with a history of environmental violations fined nearly $2 million for polluting water." The plane’s owner, Bay County contractor James Finch, has been fined in the past for filling in wetlands or allowing unfiltered runoff to flow into waterways, in violation of environmental permits. That’s a legitimate definition of polluting, and there’s no doubt Finch has been fined almost $2 million over the years. It’s hypocritical of the state GOP to call out Finch when one of his subcontractors has benefited from a relationship with Gov. Scott. But that doesn’t change the facts. We rate the statement True.

pomt-15376	Says U.S. Sen. Ron Johnson "voted to cut $700m from Medicare."	mostly false	/wisconsin/statements/2015/jul/01/moveon/moveonorg-says-ron-johnson-voted-cut-700-million-m/	Medicare has long been considered one of the third-rail issues of politics. Touch it, and the chances of recovery are slim. So it should be no surprise that political rivals depict their opponents as being on the wrong side of a high-voltage issue like Medicare funding. MoveOn.org, a political organizing group that endorsed Democrat Russ Feingold in May, put it bluntly June 11, 2015 in a Facebook post about U.S. Sen. Ron Johnson, the man Feingold hopes to unseat in 2016: "Senator Johnson just voted to cut $700m from Medicare." Below the headline, the post indicated the cuts were part of a vote on legislation to give President Barack Obama additional latitude to negotiate trade deals. Let's start at the beginning. Medicare and international trade? The Trans-Pacific Partnership, which aims to open trade between the United States and several countries, including Chile, Singapore, New Zealand, Vietnam, Canada and Mexico, would leave some American workers unemployed as a result of the increased competition from abroad. To compensate for that, a second bill would temporarily reinstate a program called Trade Adjustment Assistance, or TAA, to help retrain and provide temporary benefits to those who become unemployed because of the trade measure. The Congressional Budget Office estimates the bill would cost $2.7 billion between 2015 and 2025. The cost of the program would be offset with user fees, cuts to tax credits, changing where Medicare recipients get some kidney treatments and a $700 million reduction to Medicare’s budget a decade from now, in 2025. Johnson was one of 62 senators who voted for the legislation, which the House passed June 25, 2015, sending it to Obama. For his part, Johnson argues it is not a cut at all. "The senator feels MoveOn’s statement is patently false," his communications director Melinda Schnell wrote in an email. A closer look With a budget of $505 billion in Fiscal Year 2014, Medicare is the federal government’s second-largest program, behind only Social Security. Between 2016 and 2025, the federal government is expected to spend a total of $7.3 trillion on Medicare. And the program is expected to grow -- even when the $700 million reduction is factored in. In 2025, when the $700 million budget reduction would go into effect, the federal government is expected to spend $981 billion on Medicare. Johnson's campaign points to a budget projection from the Congressional Budget Office that estimates what the federal government spends on Medicare will grow by 13.3 percent, or $115 billion, between 2024 and 2025. Even with a $700 million reduction, spending on the program will grow by about $114 billion, or 13.2 percent between 2024 and 2025. In other words, spending will increase, just by a smaller amount. The shoe was on the other foot in 2014, when Republicans argued that Democrats who voted for the Affordable Care Act -- Obamacare -- voted for a $700 billion cut to Medicare. PolitiFact National checked numerous variations of that statement, rating them Half True of Mostly False, depending on how they were worded. The Affordable Care Act reduced the expansion of Medicare by $700 billion over 10 years, while still allowing Medicare to grow. It just grew at a slower rate than it would have without the law. That's essentially what is happening here. The twist (and a primary source of complaint): In the new scenario, the Medicare money would go toward something not related to health care. Our rating Moveon.org criticized Johnson, saying he voted to cut $700 million from Medicare. But the $700 million budget reduction would not go into effect until 2025 and to say Medicare is being cut when it is still expected to grow by hundreds of billions of dollars is misleading at best. Our definition of Mostly False is "The statement contain some element of truth, but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression." That fits here.

pomt-06068	As a result of welfare reform, "poverty levels went down to the lowest level ever for ... African-American children."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/jan/09/rick-santorum/rick-santorum-says-welfare-reform-deserves-credit-/	Fresh off his near-win in Iowa, former Pennsylvania Sen. Rick Santorum held a town hall meeting in Brentwood, N.H., with voters on Jan. 4, 2011. He covered many topics, including one of his favorites: welfare reform. Santorum, who actively pushed for welfare changes as a member of Congress, talked about the effects of the 1996 reform law, telling the audience, "Guess what happened? Poverty levels went down to the lowest level ever for ... one of the areas that had the highest level of poverty historically, which is African-American children." We looked into the statement and found that Santorum is right that poverty rates declined after the reform’s passage. But opinions differ on the primary cause. What the reform did Santorum was first elected to the House in 1991 and helped write the Republicans’ Contract with America, which proposed a major overhaul to the federal welfare system. President Bill Clinton had been elected promising to "end welfare as we know it." The legislative battle over just how to do that spanned several years. In 1996, Santorum had moved on to the Senate, helping win passage of a law that transformed welfare from an entitlement -- guaranteeing cash for needy people -- to a temporary assistance program with dollar caps and time limits on what beneficiaries could receive. It shifted most of the administrative work to the states and required recipients to move toward work and financial independence. The idea was that people on welfare -- who were still poor because benefits did not exceed the poverty line -- would be motivated to seek job training and full employment and end up being better off financially. For backup to his claim about the reform’s positive effect on black child poverty, Santorum’s campaign pointed us to a 2006 report by the conservative Heritage Foundation. It argued that poverty rates declined following reform and have stayed low even through fluctuations in the economy. The report’s author, Robert Rector, testified before the House Ways and Means Committee that "in the quarter century prior to welfare reform, the old welfare system failed to reduce poverty among black children. Since welfare reform, the poverty rate among black children has fallen at an unprecedented rate from 41.5 percent in 1995 to 32.9 percent in 2004." We found this U.S. Census chart, which presents slightly different figures for poverty among African-Americans under age 18: 41.5 percent in 1995 but 33.4 in 2004. The general trend, however, is the same. Rector’s report includes a chart showing that even previous periods of economic expansion did not lead to a significant drop in welfare cases. "How was the economic expansion of the 1990s different from the eight prior expansions?" the report asks. "The answer is welfare reform." In an interview, Rector said those patterns have held true even through the current recession. "There was a sort of structural shift downward around the period of welfare reform," he said. "It really has remained at a substantially lower level, although recessions have an effect." Other perspectives While Rector maintains that the economy played only a secondary role in reducing poverty, other groups says it’s the main driver. After all, welfare reform became law during the longest period of economic growth in U.S. history. "While there was a decrease in poverty overall in the economic boom of the late 1990s, it was not a result of welfare reform but due to the strength of the broader economy," said Liz Schott, a senior fellow at the left-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. "There was an increase in labor market participation by single mothers during these years, but much of that increase was lost when the economy weakened." And Austin Nichols wrote in a 2006 report for the Urban Institute that improvements in the low-wage job market, especially for less-educated workers, benefited black children more than others because their parents tend to have less education. "We still have welfare reform, but as the low-wage job market weakened, child poverty shot back up," Nichols said in an e-mail. The Census put the child poverty rate for African-Americans at 35.3 percent in 2009. Rector said it’s about 38 percent today. And a 2011 study by the Annie E. Casey Foundation, a private charitable organization that describes its goal as "helping build better futures for disadvantaged children in the United States," said that the last decade has been especially damaging for poor children. "The official child poverty rate, which is a conservative measure of economic hardship, increased 18 percent between 2000 and 2009, essentially returning to the same level as the early 1990s," the report stated. Our ruling Santorum credited welfare reform for driving poverty down to the lowest level ever for African-American children. He’s right that the poverty rate did reach historic lows following the reform’s passage, but the reason why is not so clear cut. There’s good evidence that the policy changes took more people off the welfare rolls by requiring them to work. And working, it follows, makes people better off than reliance on relatively low levels of public assistance. But the booming economy of the late 1990s had a lot to do with former welfare recipients gaining employment, as there were ample jobs to be had. Experts say the law and the healthy employment picture combined to help lift people out of poverty. And recently, as the economy has weakened and unemployment increased, poverty rates have risen, too. On balance, we rate Santorum’s claim Half True.

pomt-03301	Government subsidies for renewable energies such as wind and solar are 100 times greater than those given to gas and coal, and 50 times greater than what the nuclear industry enjoys.	half-true	/georgia/statements/2013/jul/31/tom-fanning/energy-subsidies-claim-needs-more-context/	In recent months, the benefits of expanding the use of solar energy in Georgia have been picked apart by grass-roots activists and others like a good bowl of Brunswick stew. For example, PolitiFact Georgia recently examined a claim by one group that electricity rates are 40 percent higher in states that have required utility companies to use a certain amount of renewable energy such as solar power. We rated that claim Half True. Last month, the man who runs Georgia’s largest public utility offered up some statistics concerning federal government subsidies for renewable energies such as solar. His comments prompted us to measure their accuracy on the Truth-O-Meter. Government subsidies for renewable energies such as wind and solar are 100 times greater than those given to gas and coal, and 50 times greater than what the nuclear industry enjoys, Southern Co. CEO Tom Fanning said, according to one account. The Georgia Sierra Club disputed Fanning’s account and asked PolitiFact Georgia to determine whether he is correct. The debate on renewable energies took on added importance when the state’s Public Service Commission voted 3-2 on July 11 to require Georgia Power, which is owned by Southern Co., to commit to using a certain amount of solar in its long-term plan. A Southern Co. spokesman supplied us with information to back up Fanning’s claim, but others with expertise on energy subsidies say Fanning cherry-picked his data. The company supplied us with a chart from the U.S. Energy Information Administration that shows how much money the federal government gave out in subsidies for various sources of energy in 2010. The chart contained numbers that were similar to the most recent EIA data concerning energy subsidies. The energy source that received the largest amount of subsidies was biofuels, at about $7.7 billion. Much of the gasoline in the United States is blended with a biofuel -- ethanol. Biofuels are considered a renewable energy. Wind energy was a distant second, at just under $5 billion. Solar energy received slightly more than $1 billion, which was less than oil and gas ($2.8 billion), and coal ($1.35 billion). The subsidies for most renewable energies were greater than other sources, but not 100 times greater or even 50 times greater. These numbers, though, weren’t what Southern Co. focused on in its response to us. The chart, based on reports by two federal agencies, shows how much money various forms of energy received in subsidies in comparison with each barrel of energy consumed. That’s the better way to make a comparison, Southern Co. says. Here’s a breakdown: Solar $59.60 Wind $31.33 Biofuel $10.46 Nuclear $1.71 Coal $0.38 Oil and gas $0.27 According to these numbers, solar energy’s subsidy was nearly 157 times greater than coal. Wind was 116 times greater than oil and gas. Nuclear was six times greater than oil and gas. "This data illustrates the disproportionate amount of federal subsidies renewables are receiving compared to other energy resources," Southern Co. spokesman Tim Leljedal said. Leljedal added: " While we are continuing to expand our renewable energy resources in a manner that makes sense for customers, we recognize that the subsidization of wind and solar at current levels is not sustainable." Elias Hinckley, an attorney who teaches energy policy at Georgetown University and has done work for Georgia Power, believes Fanning’s claim needs considerable context. Hinckley said comparing the support for newer energy resources such as solar and wind with coal and gas is akin to measuring the popularity of Coca-Cola in Atlanta against Pepsi. "Comparing young technologies to old, established, regulatory-protected assets is silly if you're working on a unit of energy used basis -- the point of subsidies is (or at least should be) to create a fair playing field where an unnatural advantage exists," said Hinckley, a partner at Sullivan & Worcester LLP, based in Washington. Hinckley added: "Coal, for example, has had the benefit of free emissions for a century (longer if we go beyond electric production to thermal/steam use), which has never been, and can't on a retroactive basis, be properly priced." Mark Thurber, an author and scholar on the economics of energy, agreed that wind and solar receive more in government subsidies. But Thurber, an associate director of the Program on Energy and Sustainable Development at Stanford University, questioned the validity of such comparisons for some of the same reasons mentioned by Hinckley. We followed up with Southern Co. concerning the criticism. We also wondered whether Fanning’s comparison is fair since the federal government boosted subsidies for renewable energies in the 2009 economic stimulus package. Leljedal noted that no one disputes subsidies for renewable energies are higher than other forms of energy. Leljedal added: "While the amount of subsidies can vary from year to year, that fact remains that subsidies are required to make renewable energy cost-competitive with other generation resources." To sum up, Southern Co. CEO Tom Fanning claimed government subsidies for renewable energies such as wind and solar are 100 times greater than they are for older forms of energy such as coal and oil, and 50 times greater for nuclear energy. One chart backs up Fanning’s claim on solar and wind, but not nuclear. Another report does not. Some experts noted that renewable forms of energy haven’t been developed as long as others and need the help. Coal and natural gas have been receiving subsidies for far longer than solar energy, wind and nuclear energy, which is an important point. Fanning’s general point that renewable energies are getting substantially greater financial support from Uncle Sam at this point in time is on target. But the specific numbers he used aren’t entirely correct, and his claim needs some context to be fully understood. Our rating: Half True.

pomt-06670	"The academic achievements of our student-athletes are mentioned in the same breath and spirit as Notre Dame and Stanford."	mostly false	/florida/statements/2011/sep/09/donna-shalala/shalala-says-ums-athletes-are-mentionned-same-brea/	As news spread that a convicted Ponzi schemer said he plied University of Miami football players with everything from booze to prostitutes, university president Donna Shalala tried -- as best she could -- to spin the story away from the troubling allegations. "Let us not forget who we are," Shalala said in a video posted on the university's website Aug. 29. "Nationally the academic achievements of our student-athletes are mentioned in the same breath and spirit as Notre Dame and Stanford. This is because we are first and foremost an academic institution." Notre Dame. Stanford. And ... UM. Really? PolitiFact Florida felt compelled to tackle (pun intended) this question about academic excellence. Shalala relied on two sources of data to back up her claim -- graduation rates for student-athletes and a measure crafted by the National Collegiate Athletic Association, the NCAA, to measure the progress of student-athletes. For the 2009-10 year, UM student-athletes had what the NCAA calls a "graduation success rate" of 86 percent. That means that 86 percent of student-athletes who started between 2000-03 graduated within six years. According to NCAA statistics, UM ranks 7th in the 12-school Atlantic Coast Conference (Duke and Boston College graduated 97 percent of their student-athletes, for instance) and well behind the graduation rates at Notre Dame (99 percent) and Stanford (94 percent). The other measure Shalala cited -- specifically when it comes to the football program -- is called "academic progress rate." The APR measures, as its title suggests, progress -- not academic achievement; students get points for being academically eligible and staying in school. To the APR, a student-athlete who scores all C's in music therapy would "look" the same as one who scores A's in organic chemistry. And by that measure, the most recent scores for the three schools' football programs are close -- 979 for UM, 977 for Stanford and 971 for Notre Dame. That's good -- a 1,000 is a perfect score -- but not that uncommon. On the NCAA's website, we found about 28 university football programs that have APR scores between 971 and 979 and an additional 20 schools with better scores. So Notre Dame, Stanford and UM share the spotlight with Wofford, Appalachian State and the University of North Dakota. But Shalala's pointing to a very limited source of information about student-athletes. Mark Nagel, a professor in sport management at the University of South Carolina, described the APR as a "public relations mechanism" created by the NCAA. "What APR is telling you is that the students are remaining eligible and retained on campus," Nagel said. "It is not telling you their majors, educational outcomes or what they are learning." And the APR rates certainly don't indicate if students are, as one professor described it, taking "rinky-dink courses." A 2006 New York Times article showed that the Auburn University football team performed phenomenally on APR -- even finishing ahead of academically stout Duke. It turned out that many of the Auburn athletes were taking the equivalent of an independent study from the same sociology professor. Andrew Zimbalist, a Smith College economics professor who has written about the business of sports, says APR doesn't measure the quality of students' progress or learning -- just simply that they aren't dropping out. "I would never compare the academic quality or achievement at two universities on the basis of drop-out rates,'' he said. "It seems to me the educational process is deeper and richer and more complex. But, by the same token, the APR is not a meaningless number." APR also doesn't measure how rigorous (or not) the courses are or whether they are relying on tutors, Zimbalist said. "It's kind of shocking (Shalala) would consider APR to be a valid comparative measurement or the most important measure of academic achievement," he said. (We should note that in our research we found that Stanford had some academic achievement blemishes of its own. Athletes had access to a list of classes known as easy A's such as "Beginning Improvising" and another in "Social Dances of North America III." That list has been discontinued.) We're not the only ones to pick on Shalala's claim here -- Inside Higher Ed, an online publication, concluded that she "engaged in some hyperbole." Anyway, back to what Shalala said, which was: "Nationally the academic achievements of our student-athletes are mentioned in the same breath and spirit as Notre Dame and Stanford." This is a case where there is not a lot of evidence to back Shalala up. She cites graduation rates -- which are significantly lower for UM compared to Notre Dame and Stanford -- and the NCAA-developed "academic progress rate." But that measure awards points to students for remaining academically eligible and enrolled in school. If that's your definition of "academic achievement," we'd like to know where we can sign up for classes. Nagel, the sport management professor from South Carolina, summed it up best: "I have a sneaking suspicion that the only time those three schools are discussed in the same (breath) and spirit is within the halls of the University of Miami’s administrative offices." We rate this claim Mostly False.	None	Donna Shalala	None	None	None	2011-09-09T12:09:00	2011-08-29	['None']
pomt-06062	"At my first ‘Let’s Get to Work Day’ … we sold out;" more than 240 dozen doughnuts by 8:30 a.m.	mostly false	/florida/statements/2012/jan/10/rick-scott/rick-scott-talks-doughnuts-2012-state-state-addres/	Like many Americans, Florida Gov. Rick Scott finds it hard to pass over a good doughnut. Or a doughnut story. Scott started his career running a pair of doughnut shops in Kansas City in the 1970s. He returned to his doughnut roots in 2011, spending a day working at Nicola’s Donuts in Tampa. In a black hat that he clearly didn’t like wearing and a matching black shirt, Gov. Scott baked and then sold fried pastries by the dozen to customers. You can read all about his day, the first of Scott’s "Let’s Get to Work Days", here. Or you can just listen to Scott tell the story himself -- which he did during his second State of the State address on Jan. 10, 2012. With owner Rachel Waatti listening on from the House chambers, Scott went on about doughnuts. He joked about how you don’t have to worry about employees eating too many doughnuts (they’re just too rich) and how Waatti complained that Scott was spending too much time with the media and not enough time working. He then touted the accomplishments of his day back in the doughnut business. "We sold out; more than 240 dozen by 8:30 a.m.," he said. Your humble fact-checker happened to be tailing Scott that day and can report, the doughnut man-turned-governor is creating a bit of doughnut lore. The doors to Nicola’s opened at 6 a.m. and doughnuts were being snatched off the shelves (Your fact-checker knows, because he purchased a dozen himself to share with his hungry colleagues.) By 8:30 a.m., the store had already run out of doughnuts and had to grab another 15-or-so dozen doughnuts from Nicola’s second location. How many doughnuts were sold by the time Scott left? Waatti and workers told PolitiFact Florida the number was definitely above the 65 dozen they originally baked for the shop and was probably around 80 dozen. That’s probably at least 240,000 calories of breakfast, but it’s not the "more than 240 dozen" Scott bragged to legislators about. Shortly after Scott’s speech, Waatti spoke to David DeCamp of the Tampa Bay Times. She said the 240-dozen figure includes all of the doughnuts sold at both Nicola’s locations throughout the entire day Scott worked at the bakery. But she also reconfirmed that the shop Scott worked at sold about 80 dozen while he was there. At PolitiFact Florida, we’re almost as serious about our doughnuts as we are our fact-checks. We rate Scott’s "240 dozen" claim Mostly False. Now can somebody pass a maple glazed?	None	Rick Scott	None	None	None	2012-01-10T13:59:46	2012-01-10	['None']
pomt-02019	"Sen. McConnell says it's not his job to bring jobs to Kentucky."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2014/jun/06/alison-lundergan-grimes/alison-lundergan-grimes-charges-mitch-mcconnell-sa/	President Barack Obama's recently announced plan to cut greenhouse gas emissions from coal-fired power plants 30 percent by 2030 isn’t going over so well in coal states. Both senate candidates in Kentucky -- the country’s third-largest coal producer -- are speaking out against the plan and the danger it poses to Kentucky jobs. Democratic candidate Alison Lundergan Grimes jumped at the opportunity to remind voters of a comment by her opponent, incumbent and Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., about bringing jobs to Kentucky. In a 60-second radio ad, Grimes first chastises Obama for the emissions plan, then turns to her competitor. "Coal supplies 92 percent of our state's electricity," the narrator says. "(Obama's) new regulations will lead to severe rate increases, shortages of power and the loss of even more coal jobs. Kentucky already has the fifth-highest unemployment rate in the country. It's bad enough we've lost 18,000 jobs since Mitch McConnell became senator. It's even worse that Senator McConnell says it's not his job to bring jobs to Kentucky." With jobs and unemployment the most important issues for many Americans -- and with Kentucky experiencing 7.7 percent unemployment, which is well above the national average -- we wondered whether McConnell really said this. It turns out that the claim references an interview McConnell gave to The Beattyville Enterprise, a weekly newspaper in Lee County, Ky., with a circulation of about 1,200 and no website, back in April. The six-paragraph-long story ran with the headline, "McConnell says not his job to bring jobs." The Grimes campaign pounced on the headline and ran, giving the comment far more attention than the paper’s original circulation. Here’s the full text of the story: U.S. Senator Mitch McConnell said Friday that it is not his responsibility to bring jobs to Kentucky. Appearing in Beattyville, McConnell was asked by The Beattyville Enterprise what he was going to do to bring jobs to Lee County. "Economic development is a Frankfort issue," McConnell said. "That is not my job. It is the primary responsibility of the state Commerce Cabinet." Asked about public works projects, McConnell said he is interested in bringing public works to the state. "Most comes from the state, though," he said. He did say that he is responsible for protecting jobs by "pushing back" against the Obama Administration's restrictions on the coal industry. "Oil and gas are big here," he said of Lee County. "They (the Obama Administration) are making it hard on them, too," he said. In an interview with PolitiFact, Edmund Shelby -- the reporter, as well as the paper’s editor and general manager -- said the interview was quick, taking place in a hallway before McConnell spoke at a luncheon at the town's community center. McConnell’s point, Shelby said, was that the responsibility for creating Kentucky jobs lies with the state government in Frankfort and the Commerce Cabinet (which is actually now known as the Cabinet for Economic Development). So, while McConnell did say the phrase, "that is not my job," in response to a question about bringing jobs to his home state, he said his comments were taken out of context. At a May press conference, McConnell said he thought Shelby was asking him about specific industries in Lee County that are "obviously a job of the state Commerce Department." "This April, I visited Lee County to talk about a top priority of mine: jobs," McConnell said in an April statement. "Unfortunately, it seems my message got lost in translation, and I was surprised to see a headline about my visit that sent the exact opposite message to the one I was trying to convey." Shelby didn't electronically record the exchange, and he didn't stay for the luncheon -- where McConnell made remarks about the economy and jobs. However, Shelby stands by his story and said it is impossible that the comments were taken out of context because the interview was only long enough for the questions included in the article. The Grimes campaign has shrugged off McConnell’s "out of context" defense and has sought to make hay of what McConnell was reported to have said. "Clearly McConnell made a major error and used the ‘lost in translation’ excuse to blame a local news editor for accurately reporting on his comments," the Grimes campaign said. However, the "not my job" statement isn’t the only comment McConnell makes in the piece. His later comment that part of his responsibility is to protect Kentucky's jobs from the threat of over-regulation from the federal government and the Obama administration is an argument he often makes in his campaign. "In my travels across the Commonwealth, I hear too often how government is blocking job creation," he said in the April statement. "It’s up to all of us -- at the federal, state and local levels -- to fix that. We must ensure that our utility and tax rates remain low and we must enact a right to work law. The better the atmosphere the state sets for job creators, the more effectively Kentucky can compete against other states to add and retain jobs." Al Cross, director of the Institute for Rural Journalism and Community Issues at the University of Kentucky, said McConnell can point to a record to support his view. McConnell has a "long history of doing earmarks and other legislation that helps create and preserve jobs in the state," he said. McConnell spokesman Don Stewart pointed to several pieces of job-protecting legislation that McConnell has sponsored or supported, such as the 2013 Freedom to Fish Act, which supported tourism and hospitality jobs in the Barkley Lake region, which he said brings in $3 million in fishing-related tourism to the state each year. In fiscal year 2010, McConnell was one of the top-10 solo earmarkers in the Senate, securing more than $60 million for 38 projects, according to Taxpayers for Common Sense, a Washington-based advocacy group. Congress banned earmarks soon after the 2010 election. Grimes has used McConnell’s Beattyville Enterprise comments to promote her own jobs plan, in which she devotes significant attention to criticizing McConnell’s record. Shelby said he thinks McConnell was saying what he actually thought. It’s possible that McConnell thought he was talking to a "small-town, bumbling editor," which Shelby is not, he said. "In my opinion, Sen. McConnell committed the cardinal sin of career politicians by giving an honest answer to a reporter," said Shelby, a former president of the Kentucky Press Association. Our ruling Grimes said, "Sen. McConnell said it’s not his job to bring jobs to Kentucky." She took this comment from a brief interview McConnell gave to a small-town newspaper in April. We have no reason to doubt the accuracy of the news report, but while the Grimes campaign has a point that McConnell used that particular phrase, they are glossing over some nuances in what he said by selectively quoting the report. McConnell also told the paper that he has a responsibility to protect jobs, and that some of his work in Congress has led to job creation in Kentucky. In addition, McConnell’s legislative record shows a concern for local employment. We rate this claim Half True.	None	Alison Lundergan Grimes	None	None	None	2014-06-06T13:33:57	2014-06-03	['Kentucky']
pomt-08532	The Chilean "privatization scheme" that Sharron Angle supports "has resulted in hidden fees, fewer benefits, and millions of people with no coverage."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/oct/04/patriot-majority-pac/patriot-majority-pac-conjures-chilean-dictator-att/	It isn't often that U.S. campaigns venture into Latin American retirement policy, but the knock-down, drag-out battle for a Nevada Senate seat has done just that. It came up in an ad run by the Patriot Majority PAC, an obscure Washington-based group that appears to be spending big money on campaign advertising this year, primarily against Sharron Angle, the Republican who's challenging Senate Majority Harry Reid, D-Nev. The ad seizes on a comment made by Angle about Social Security privatization during an Aug. 12, 2010, interview with KLAS-TV. Here's the narration: "How does Sharron Angle plan to phase out Social Security? (Video of Angle saying, "Chile has done this.") Chile? The country once led by Augusto Pinochet, the military dictator and human rights violator? Chile's privatization scheme has resulted in hidden fees, fewer benefits and millions of people with no coverage. (Angle: "Chile has done this.") Privatize? Phase out? Pinochet? (Angle: "Chile has done this.") Another day, and another bad idea from Sharron Angle. What's next?" We were somewhat caught off guard by the ad sponsor's effort to use Angle's pension-policy positions to link her to a "military dictator and human rights violator," complete with footage of goose-stepping Chilean soldiers on parade. But that connection, tenuous though it may be, didn't strike us as checkable in our conventional sense. Instead, we'll focus on whether the ad fairly describes the nuts and bolts of Chilean retirement security. Is the ad justified in saying that "Chile's privatization scheme has resulted in hidden fees, fewer benefits and millions of people with no coverage"? For many years, the Chilean system has been an inspiration to free-market advocates in the U.S. and elsewhere, so it's not surprising that Angle would have cited it. Here's some background on the system. Chile created its first Social Security-style programs in the 1920s, a decade or so before the United States did. But the government under Pinochet made a big change in 1981, transitioning all new workers -- as well as beneficiaries of the old, defined-benefit system who were willing to make the switch -- to a pension plan based on individual accounts run by private-sector investment managers. By now, almost all Chileans are enrolled in the post-1981 system. The program details have changed somewhat over the years, most recently due to a major round of changes in 2008. But the general outline has remained the same. Ten percent of workers' income is automatically deducted to fund their retirement, disability and survivor insurance, plus an additional charge for administrative costs. Employees can choose from among several government-approved private pension management companies, each of which offers five varieties of funds with varying degrees of risk. The funds and their approaches have been reviewed by a government regulator. Total assets in the system by the end of 2009 reached $107 billion in U.S dollars, or about 65 percent of Chile’s gross domestic product. Because the Chilean system has been a trendsetter, it has been studied extensively. Independent analyses suggest that over the long term, the level of support for retirees under Chile's system has been close or better than that in similar countries. But the Chilean system has also faced its share of criticism. Some of that criticism echoes what the ad says. Here's a closer look at the three issues raised in the ad. • Hidden fees. High fees have been a longstanding concern about the Chilean system. Due to lack of competition among private-sector money managers that participate in the system, these management companies' profits have been much larger than profit margins in other sectors of Chile’s financial services industry, wrote U.S. Social Security Administration researcher Barbara E. Kritzer in one paper. Over a full career contributing to the system, workers pay around 15 percent for administration, according to the International Organization of Pension Supervisors. This is in the middle of six Latin American countries and below five Eastern European countries with a Chilean-style individual accounts system. Several experts said that a series of government reforms in 2008 helped lower fees. In our reporting, we found that even supporters of the system acknowledged that fees have been a problem. But are they "hidden," as the ad says? None of the handful of experts we spoke to said so. In fact, fees are more obvious to contributors in Chile than in other countries because they are levied on top of the mandatory contribution to private pensions. So while the ad is on track in its criticism of fees, it is wrong to say they are hidden. • Fewer benefits. Most studies have shown a long-term rate of return in the Chilean system of roughly 10 percent, which is high by international standards. But even if those rates of return are optimistic going forward -- whether because they were boosted by a period of unusually strong returns or because of insufficient participation by Chilean workers in the plan -- experts we spoke to agreed that for Chileans, the current system is preferable to the pre-1981 system. In fact, Pinochet's system remained in place after the transition to democracy and was retained by the socialist administration of Michelle Bachelet. (Bachelet lost power in March 2010.) Mauricio Soto of the Center for Retirement Research at Boston College has written that the old pension system was "in crisis" prior to 1981 -- paying more in benefits than it was receiving in contributions, with a projected actuarial imbalance greater than the country's gross domestic product. In addition, the patchwork system was "poorly administered and inefficient" and led to discrepancies in which "white-collar workers could comfortably retire in their 40s, while blue-collar workers had to wait until their 60s to qualify for minimum retirement benefits." There's no question that the current investor-based pension system carries risks, being subject to markets that can go up or down. But Chile's old system simply wasn't sustainable. "It was unfunded and essentially a fantasy," said Michael Tanner, a senior fellow with the libertarian Cato Institute, a longtime champion of the Chilean system. So to suggest, as the ad does, that switching to a private system in 1981 resulted in "fewer benefits" is at best misleading. • Millions of people with no coverage. This charge is true -- but misleading for a couple reasons. Though the proportion of Chileans participating in the system has varied over time, the percentage has hovered around two-thirds, a rate similar to under the pre-1981 system. This is clearly less than the nearly universal coverage provided by the U.S. Social Security system. But Chile is also not nearly as rich as the U.S. Several experts we spoke to agreed that the coverage gaps have at least as much to do with the nature of the Chilean economy as with the design of the country's retirement system. Soto notes that low-income Chileans working in the underground economy account for about 30 percent of the workforce. These workers are typically not covered by the pension system unless they have previously worked in a legitimate business. Meanwhile, participation by the self-employed was for many years voluntary (and very low), though mandatory participation is being phased in by the 2008 reforms. Even among workers in traditional jobs, participation rates have usually topped out around 80 percent, with the percentage taking part at any given time even lower, since workers do not always keep up their contributions due to unemployment or a failure to comply with the law. This is a serious issue. As Kritzer notes, "only a small portion" of workers with less-than-perfect participation histories "would have enough contributions to qualify for the guaranteed minimum benefit at retirement." The 2008 reform addressed coverage concerns by introducing a universal pension paid to all Chileans over the age of 65 regardless of their contribution history. In addition, workers with small pensions from their individual accounts will have them topped up by the government. While we think it's fair for the ad to note that the Chilean system has holes, it's important to note that the pre-1981 system had holes too -- and that the nature of the Chilean economy plays at least as big a role in causing this problem as the retirement system itself. So where does this leave us? The ad demonizes the Chilean system in ways that we think are exaggerated. Fees are a problem, but they are not hidden. Rather than offering smaller benefits, the system has provided strong returns and is almost certainly sounder today than prior to 1981. And the coverage gaps that exist now are not unique to the privatized system and have a lot to do with specific factors at play in Chile. The ad does have a point that the Chilean system, at least if it's implemented without major differences, would likely be seen by most Americans as inferior to Social Security. The size of the coverage gaps in Chile's system, while understandable given Chile's economic situation, would be unacceptable to many, if not most, Americans. But this reasonable point is undercut by the ad's overheated rhetoric ("human rights violator"), imagery (the goose-stepping soldiers) and exaggerations about the substance of the Chilean plan. On balance, we rate the ad Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.

Joe Wilson to become a heckler during President Barack Obama's health care address on Sept. 9, 2009, was the question of whether illegal immigrants would receive coverage from Democratic health care reforms. On the night of Obama's speech, we ruled that Wilson's outburst — shouting "You lie!" after Obama said that health reform would not insure illegal immigrants — was False. Since then, many Republicans have said there's nothing in the bill that ensures people would have their citizenship verified before getting coverage, a claim that we will explore with this item. In a "myth vs. fact" statement responding to the president's address, the House Republican Conference quoted President Obama saying, "There are also those who claim that our reform effort will insure illegal immigrants. This, too, is false. The reforms I'm proposing would not apply to those who are here illegally." The Republican conference then says, "Fact: Nothing in any of the Democrat bills would require individuals to verify their citizenship or identity prior to receiving taxpayer-subsidized benefits, making the President's promise one that the legislation itself does not keep.'" To explore that, we first need to explain that there are two kinds of benefits in the bill that can be considered taxpayer-subsidized: tax credits and access to the public insurance option. Democrats say the main health care bill, HR 3200, explicitly prevents illegal immigrants from getting "affordability credits" — tax credits for low-income people to buy health insurance on a national health insurance exchange. While illegal immigrants would be able to buy insurance just as a qualifying legal resident could, they would have to pay for it themselves without the "affordability credit" subsidy. (If you want to check, it's on page 132, section 242.) That's essentially keeping the status quo, in which illegal immigrants are able to buy private insurance on their own dime. Critics of the health care bill, however, cite a couple of possible loopholes. We'll address the one cited by the House Republican Conference, which has also been noted by the Federation for American Immigration Reform, an organization critical of illegal immigration. Both groups contend that the Democratic bills lack verification procedures to make sure that illegal immigrants aren't signing up for the affordability credits. Such safeguards, FAIR says, were included in the Welfare Reform Act of 1996, the Economic Stimulus Act of 2008 and the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009. From our examination of the House bill, we don't see any verification system, either. The Congressional Research Service, a nonpartisan research arm of Congress, agrees. In a report issued Aug. 25, 2009, CRS wrote that "HR 3200 does not contain a mechanism to verify immigration status." (We also noted that in our original item when we checked Wilson's heckle, here .) FAIR notes that the House Ways and Means Committee rejected an amendment that would have required those seeking affordability credits to verify eligibility with two databases used to check it for federal benefits such as Medicaid. But there are two caveats that keep the Republican assertion from being fully accurate. The first is if the tax credits are administered through the Internal Revenue Service, there would be built-in scrutiny. For instance, if a system were set up for taxpayers to declare insurance expenses and then receive a refund or a rebate, illegal immigrants couldn't obtain coverage, "because illegal immigrants do not have legitimate Social Security numbers," said Marc Rosenblum, a senior policy analyst with the Migration Policy Institute, a group that is generally proimmigration. "Screening out illegal immigrants through the tax system would prevent them from obtaining health care-related subsidies." The second caveat is that language in the House bill does provide clear authority for the new government official who will run the exchange to set up that verification, as the CRS report notes. Rosenblum concurs. "The commissioner could enforce these restrictions in one of two ways: through document- and database-based screening requirements as in the Medicaid system, or by reimbursing health care expenses through tax refunds," he said. Because the House Republican Conference assertion referred to "any" of the Democratic bills, we also looked through the bill reported by the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee. The bill is generally more vague on these issues, but we did find the following passage, which seems to grant similar authority as the House bill passage cited earlier. "The Secretary (of Health and Human Services), in consultation with the Office of the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology, shall develop interoperable, secure, scalable, and reusable standards and protocols that facilitate enrollment of individuals in Federal and State health and human services programs. ... The Secretary shall facilitate enrollment of individuals in programs ... through methods which shall include (i) electronic matching against existing Federal and State data to serve as evidence of eligibility and digital documentation in lieu of paper-based documentation; (ii) capability for individuals to apply, recertify, and manage eligibility information online, including conducting real-time queries against databases for existing eligibility prior to submitting applications; and (iii) other functionalities necessary to provide eligible individuals with a streamlined enrollment process." Now for the second issue: access to the public option. FAIR and many Republicans have argued that while the bill bars illegal immigrants from getting the affordability credits, it still permits them to take part in the public option. We believe that reading is correct. But FAIR asserts that the public option is "taxpayer-funded," something Democrats insist is not true. They say the public plan will be self-supporting through its participants' premiums. Obama reiterated that point in his speech. "I have insisted that like any private insurance company, the public insurance option would have to be self-sufficient and rely on the premiums it collects," he said. Nothing we've seen so far has persuaded us that the public option will provide subsidized care. So let's recap. There is explicit language in the House bill that says illegal immigrants should not receive the subsidized benefits. But we find the Republican conference is right that the legislation does not directly mention verification procedures and, for that reason, it's possible that illegal immigrants who are determined to beat the system might be able to get around the ban. But it's likely that the IRS would, at least indirectly, help to police that. And, the health choices commissioner would have the authority to set up a verification system. On balance, we rate the Republican claim Half True.	None	House Republican Conference	None	None	None	2009-09-10T17:20:55	2009-09-09	['None']
pomt-09095	"If the Republicans were the majority, (Rep. Barton) would have actually the gavel and the chairmanship."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/jun/23/rahm-emanuel/emanuel-says-bp-apologist-rep-barton-would-be-chai/	With many Republican leaders distancing themselves from Rep. Joe Barton’s apology to BP (including Barton), Democrats have been quick to point out that Barton isn’t any old congressman. He’s the ranking Republican on the House Energy and Commerce Committee that oversees the oil industry. Imagine, some Democrats have warned, what would happen if Republicans won control of the House in midterm elections. White House Chief of Staff Rahm Emanuel alluded to that on ABC's This Week on June 20, 2010, when he warned "the ranking Republican (Barton) would have oversight into the energy industry, and if the Republicans were the majority, would have actually the gavel and the chairmanship." Three days earlier, White House spokesman Robert Gibbs made a similar claim via Twitter: "Who would the GOP put in charge of overseeing the energy industry & Big Oil if they won control of Congress? Yup, u guessed it - JOE BARTON." Well, not so fast. While congressmen who are a minority party’s ranking member on a committee often rise to the chairmanship if their party regains majority control, that’s not always the truth. As Politico's Jonathan Allen pointed out, "Barton has somewhere between zero and no chance of being the Energy and Commerce Committee chairman next year, according to Republican rules and sources." Here’s why. Back in 1995, House Republicans under Speaker Newt Gingrich’s leadership imposed term limits on their own committee and subcommittee chairmen. Under those rules, a chairman or ranking member must step down after three terms. Rep. Barton’s third term heading the Republican contingent on the Energy and Commerce Committee will end at the conclusion of this Congress. Exceptions have been made over the years, and Barton could seek a waiver from the Steering Committee. But Michael Steel, spokesman for House Republican Leader John Boehner, told us such waivers will only be considered in "extraordinary circumstances." For the record, Boehner’s hard line on term limits for committee leadership predates the Barton apology controversy. Back on Feb. 3, 2010, Boehner announced that the Steering Committee decided it would adhere to the term limits policy, even if Republicans were to regain control of the House. That wasn’t a popular decision with the ranking members of some committees who lamented that their leadership window would be eaten up by years serving as a relatively powerless ranking member of the minority party. Barton, R-Texas, was among those who complained the loudest. "Don’t ask me to do a good job in the minority and make a rule that says you can’t continue to do a good job as chairman," Barton told Politico back in February. Although some Republicans called for his ouster as the ranking member on the House Energy and Commerce panel, the Washington Post reported that Barton offered another apology to Republican colleagues on June 23, 2010, and that Republican leaders have decided to keep him in that seat through this Congress. Again, exceptions to the term limit rule can and have been made in the past. In practice, Republican leadership can make exceptions whenever it wants. Given the Republican leadership’s rebuke of Barton’s comment, and the fact that Democrats have clearly seized on it as a potential wedge issue in the upcoming mid-term elections (Emanuel called it a "political gift") it’s hard to imagine Barton would be likely to win such an exception. A literal reading of Emanuel's comments leaves ambiguous whether he is saying if the Republicans were the majority right now, then Barton would be chair, or if he's predicting what could happen if Republicans were to regain control of the House in the midterm elections. If Republicans were in the majority right now, then Barton would be chair. But they are not. We think in the context of talking about Barton's comment as a political gift, Emanuel is raising the specter of what would happen if the GOP wins a House majority in the midterm elections. The fact is, even if Republicans were to win a majority in the House, it appears unlikely Barton would have assumed chairmanship of the Energy and Commerce Committee next year anyway. Possible? Yes. But at the very least, it was far from a given, as Emanuel and Gibbs suggested. And so we rate Emanuel’s comment Half True.

pomt-02426	"Over the past three years, ‘deep poverty’ has reached its highest level on record."	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2014/mar/04/paul-ryan/paul-ryan-releases-report-saying-percentage-americ/	Republicans in the U.S. House of Representatives recently released a study that critiqued the current mix of federal anti-poverty programs and suggested a new way forward. The report, titled "The War on Poverty: 50 Years Later," was released by the House Budget Committee, which is chaired by Rep. Paul Ryan, R-Wis. Ryan was Mitt Romney’s running mate in the 2012 election and is considered a possible presidential contender in 2016. The report, released March 3, 2014, argues in part that there are too many overlapping and ineffective programs designed to help poor Americans. At one point, the authors overseen by Ryan tried to give a sense of how far-reaching the problem of poverty remains, despite the investment of countless taxpayer dollars over the course of several decades. "Over the past three years, ‘deep poverty’ has reached its highest level on record," the report said. A footnote noted that a household living in "deep poverty" is defined as one that "makes less than 50 percent of the poverty line." (The report isn't the first to use the term "deep poverty" -- other researchers have as well.) We wondered whether this was correct, so we turned to data from the U.S. Census Bureau, the official source of federal statistics on poverty. We found a table -- "Percent of People by Ratio of Income to Poverty Level" -- that breaks down those who earned various percentages of the poverty line. The smallest of those ratios was half the poverty line -- the "deep poverty" statistic the report cited. The federal poverty level is actually a matrix of different dollar amounts. It depends on the size of the family, with larger families having a higher threshold. For one person in 2014, the poverty level is $11,670, and 50 percent of that works out to $5,835. For a family of four, the poverty level is $23,850, and 50 percent of that is $11,925. The most recent data available is for 2012. That year, the Census Bureau found that 6.6 percent of Americans earned 50 percent or less of the poverty line. It was also 6.6 percent for 2011, and it was 6.7 percent for 2010. The table includes data going back to 1975, and the percentages were never as high as they got beginning in 2010. The highest percentage before 2010 was 6.3 percent in 2009; prior to that, it was 6.2 percent in 1993. That percentage was likely higher prior to the mid-1960s, since the poverty rate as a whole between 1959 and 1965 was between 17.3 percent and 22.4 percent, well above today's 15 percent. But before 1975, the statistic was not calculated, so we can’t know the answer for 50 percent of the poverty line for sure. Not surprisingly, the percentage tends to rise after recessions, which explains the recent spike as well as the one in the early-1990s as well as another in the early 1980s. Prior to the most recent recession, the rate of Americans at 50 percent of poverty was 5.2 percent in both 2006 and 2007. Our ruling Ryan, through his committee’s report, said that over the past three years, the percentage of Americans living in "deep poverty" -- making less than 50 percent of the poverty line -- "has reached its highest level on record." The past three years -- 2010 to 2012 -- clearly produced the highest percentage since the statistic has been calculated in 1975. While it’s possible the rate was higher prior to 1975, we don’t have statistics to prove that, so there’s no data "on record." So we rate the claim True.

pomt-08045	"We have the highest (corporate tax rates) in the world right now."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/jan/03/pat-toomey/pat-toomey-says-us-has-highest-corporate-tax-rates/	On the Jan. 2, 2011, edition of NBC's Meet the Press, Sen.-elect Pat Toomey, R-Pa., cited a striking statistic in urging the United States to lower its corporate tax rates. Asked by host David Gregory about possible areas where President Barack Obama and congressional Republicans can work together, Toomey suggested several areas, including taxes. "I think tax policy is a possible area, one with plenty of landmines but plenty of opportunities," Toomey said. "Simplify the code, lower rates. We should be lowering corporate tax rates because we have the highest in the world right now." (Later in the roundtable discussion, Yale Law School professor Stephen Carter repeated the statistic, but we'll check Toomey's quote here.) We wondered whether the U.S. really has the highest corporate tax rates in the world. Using the most straightforward definition of "corporate tax rates," Toomey is right. The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, a group of 32 large, industrialized democracies, ranks the "combined corporate income tax rate" in its member nations. That means the highest tax bracket for general corporate income, excluding taxes levied on specific products or services. For 2010, the U.S ranks second to Japan by a fraction of a percentage point -- 39.54 percent for Japan to 39.21 percent for the U.S. But that figure is already outdated: Japan has recently moved to cut its rate for 2011 by 5 percentage points, leaving the U.S. with the highest corporate tax rate among OECD nations. But before we declare Toomey's statement True, let's dig a little deeper. The OECD rate is the "statutory" rate -- that is, the top corporate tax rate on the books. But many companies pay considerably less than that, due to deductions and other exclusions. Adjusting for these factors produces a statistic called the "effective tax rate." The World Bank has assembled data from 183 nations and made a series of statistical adjustments to produce a full international comparison of effective tax rates. By this measurement, the U.S. rate is considerably lower than the published rate -- 27.6 percent. But in a comparative sense, that's still pretty high: Among larger international economies, only Japan, New Zealand and Thailand produced a higher effective rate in the World Bank study. And Japan's number should fall by the time next year's study comes out. The World Bank also produces another -- and broader -- statistic. This measure factors in not only the corporate profit tax but also a range of other taxes paid by businesses, including the cost of employee taxes borne by the employer. When the World Bank ranked countries from the lowest level of taxes to the highest, the U.S. ranked 124th out of 183 -- meaning corporate taxes were relatively high. A number of other large and/or democratic countries were higher, including Austria, Belgium, Brazil, China, France, Hungary, India, Italy, Spain and Sweden. This last measure provides a wider snapshot of U.S. tax policy toward businesses, but it also introduces some complications. Factoring in the employer-paid portion of labor taxes makes the corporate tax rate seem higher in countries that provide higher benefits such as pensions or health care through business taxes, while making the rate seem lower for countries that provide less generous benefits through the tax code. So making apples-to-apples comparisons can be tricky. There's also broader context that Toomey doesn't get into. In a previous item, we noted that when all taxes, including those such as personal income taxes and property taxes -- not just corporate taxes -- are taken into account and compared to gross domestic product, the U.S. doesn't rank near the top of the OECD table in total tax burden. Still, if you rate Toomey on his specific wording by looking at "corporate tax rates," he's right that the U.S. does now have the highest corporate tax rates on the books, at least among the biggest industrialized democracies, which is most economists' typical yardstick. So we rate his statement Mostly True.	None	Pat Toomey	None	None	None	2011-01-03T16:50:19	2011-01-02	['None']
pomt-03280	A judge took the Star Scientific tax case away from Ken Cuccinelli	mostly false	/virginia/statements/2013/aug/05/terry-mcauliffe/mcauliffe-says-judge-removed-ken-cuccinelli-star-s/	Democratic gubernatorial hopeful Terry McAuliffe has repeatedly sought to link GOP opponent Ken Cuccinelli to Jonnie Williams, the CEO of the troubled Star Scientific dietary supplement company. In a recent debate, McAuliffe cited a series of gifts Cuccinelli received from Williams -- including stays at the CEO’s Smith Mountain Lake home and a catered turkey dinner. McAuliffe argued those gifts swayed the Republican attorney general's conduct in a 2011 lawsuit that Star Scientific brought against the state over an assessment on property the company owns in Mecklenburg County. The company has told investors it would owe $1.7 million in taxes and penalties if it loses the case, according to the Associated Press. The Democrat accused Cuccinelli of ignoring the case, rather than taking the company to court -- a charge Cuccinelli vehemently denied, but McAuliffe continued. "Finally a judge took the case away from him because of a conflict of interest," McAuliffe said. We asked Josh Schwerin, McAuliffe’s campaign spokesman for proof that a judge removed Cuccinelli from the case. Schwerin cited a May 6, 2013 order from Mecklenburg Circuit Court Judge Leslie M. Osborn that moved the case from Cuccinelli’s office to two attorneys at the Richmond-based Troutman Sanders law firm who are representing the state on a pro bono basis. Technically, McAuliffe has a point in that a judge did take the case away from Cuccinelli. But McAuliffe’s campaign omits a major point -- the fact that the judge did that at the request of the attorney general’s office. In a motion that was signed by the pro bono attorneys -- Stephen D. Rosenthal and William H. Hurd -- Virginia assistant attorney general Elizabeth B. Myers requested that outside counsel handle the case. The motion granting that request makes no reference to whether the attorney general has a conflict of interest. It’s merely a pro forma order granting the request to switch counsel. Cuccinelli asked to be removed from the case after Democrats accused him of a conflict of interest in representing the state in the case involving Williams -- who had given Cuccinelli $13,000 in gifts. Cuccinelli later disclosed that he received an additional $5,000 in gifts. Cuccinelli also disclosed -- belatedly -- his sale of Star Scientific stock because he said he hadn’t realized its value had crossed the $10,000 threshold above which the state requires disclosure. In a prepared April 5 statement, Cuccinelli explained his decision to remove the attorney general’s office from the case and appoint outside attorneys to handle it. "To be clear, there was absolutely no conflict of interest with the attorney general’s office," Brian Gottstein, a spokesman for the attorney general said in the statement. "But in an abundance of caution, and to move past what has become an unnecessary distraction for the office and the attorney general, the case was given to outside counsel." Gottstein went on to say Cuccinelli was not personally involved in the tax case and that the attorney general’s office had filed all of its required pleadings within court deadlines. But In a March 22 article, the Associated Press quoted Paul Campsen, a private Norfolk attorney who specializes in tax litigation saying the attorney general’s previous connection to the case "isn’t just the appearance of a conflict, it is a conflict of interest." Our ruling McAuliffe said a judge took the Star Scientific tax case away from Cuccinelli. There is a grain of truth in McAuliffe’s claim, because a judge did indeed grant a motion removing the attorney general from the case. But McAuliffe’s statement is misleading because it ignores some crucial information -- the fact that the attorney general’s office was the one that requested to be removed from the case. We rate the claim Mostly False.	None	Terry McAuliffe	None	None	None	2013-08-05T06:00:00	2013-07-20	['None']
pomt-04103	"Even if you took literally every single ounce of platinum in the world, it still wouldn’t add up to enough needed to pay down our nation’s debt."	true	/new-hampshire/statements/2013/jan/14/national-republican-congressional-committee/nrcc-compares-nations-debt-all-words-platinum-take/	According to the National Republican Congressional Committee, President Barack Obama, U.S. Rep. Ann McLane Kuster and other Washington Democrats have a platinum target on their backs. That's because some economists and legal scholars say Obama -- and, by extension,other Washington Democrats could solve the nation’s debt limit problem by taking advantage of an obscure law to mint platinum coins, which Obama could use to offset the debt and avoid a standoff with House Republicans over spending cuts. Under this theory, as little as an ounce of platinum could be used to mint a coin with a denomination of $1 trillion. Neither the White House, nor Kuster, the target of a recent attack by the GOP congressional group, have commented on the matter. But, according to the Republican campaign committee, not even all the platinum in all the world could solve America’s spending problems. "Heard of that trillion-dollar platinum coin Democrats want?" the congressional committee said in a press release issued Wednesday, January 9. "Well, even if you took literally every single ounce of platinum in the world, it still wouldn’t add up to enough needed to pay down our nation’s debt," the release stated."Yet President Obama and Washington Democrats like Ann McLane Kuster continue to support policies that bankrupt our country." The NRCC's point is a bit silly because that's not what economists are proposing. But just for fun -- and a chance to leaf through the pages of "A History of Platinum" -- we decided to check it out. To be clear: We are not making a Truth-O-Meter ruling on whether Obama can do it or whether the strategy would succeed. We are simply addressing the NRCC's comparison of the total amount of platinum to the federal debt. Is the NRCC right? We decided to check the scales. First, let’s get a few calculations out of the way. As of January 9, the date of the NRCC statement, the national debt stood at $16.432 trillion, according to the U.S. Treasury Department. That same day, the price of platinum was listed at $1,583 per troy ounce, according to Platinum Today, a website (Troy ounces are the unit of measurement used to measure precious metals). By those numbers, it would take approximately 10.38 billion troy ounces of platinum to pay off the debt. So, has the world produced that much platinum? We decided to check the records. According to the Platinum Metals Review, a publication by Johnson Matthey PLC, a London-based precious metals company, 130,715 million troy ounces were supplied between 1975, the first formal records available, and 2006. And more recently, mines supplied 36.935 million ounces from 2007-2012, company records show. That brings the total of platinum mined since 1975 to 167.65 million ounces -- less than 1/60th of the 10.38 billion needed to pay off the debt. Numbers prior to 1975 are harder to track. Johnson Matthey, the industry group, didn’t keep formal records on platinum production before that time. Thankfully, historians Donald McDonald and Leslie B. Hunt offered some thoughts on the matter in their book, "A History of Platinum." According to the book, referenced on the Johnson Matthey website, two countries -- Columbia and Russia -- supplied most of the world’s platinum through most of the 19th Century. But, in 1888, explorers discovered platinum deposits in the ore mines of in Ontario, Canada. Between 1902-1919, companies mined about 33,000 ounces of platinum from the mines. And by 1929, that number increased to about 300,000 ounces per year of platinum, along with the five other metals known as the Platinum Group Metals. Elsewhere in the world, explorers discovered the Merensky Reef in South Africa in 1924, and over the years it became the world’s largest source of platinum. By 1938, the amount produced from the Merensky Reef reached 25,000 ounces per year, and by 1955, that number reached 200,000 per year, and in 1973, it exceeded 1 million ounces, according to the Platinum Metals Review. This steady increase in production makes the numbers difficult to track. But, for argument’s sake, let’s use some very generous numbers and say all the mines across the globe combined to supply 1 million ounces of platinum each year back to 1902 -- far more than most estimates. That would add 72 million ounces to the total 167.65 million tracked between 1975-2012, and the total production dating back to 1902 would then reach 239.65 million troy ounces. That total, priced at the $1,583 per ounce, the Jan. 9 rate, would equal about $379.365 billion in value -- still less than 1/40th of the $16 trillion debt figure. Even doubling the 167.65 million figure from 1975-2012 (335.3 million ounces) would leave the total value of platinum at $530.779 billion -- still less than 1/30th of the debt. And pricing that 335.3 million ounces total by $2,280, the market’s 20-year high from March 2008, the total ($764.484 billion) would still fall more than $15 trillion short. Our ruling: There are no formal counts of platinum production dating back before 1975, but based on recent records and historical accounts, there is no evidence to suggest the value of the world’s total platinum supply comes within reach of the national debt. Records from Johnson Matthey PLC, an industry leader, show that 167.65 million troy ounces were supplied between 1975-2012, and historical records indicate that number far exceeds the amount mined in the years prior. Even by the most generous counts, the total value of the the world’s platinum supply is only a fraction of the national debt. We rate this claim True.

pomt-10503	Obama spent "40 percent of the PAC money, 43 percent to be exact, on Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada and South Carolina politicians."	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/mar/27/bill-clinton/424-percent-by-our-calculations/	In a March 16, 2008, interview with a group of college journalists, former President Bill Clinton stated that an inordinate amount of money distributed by Sen. Barack Obama's leadership PAC, Hopefund, went to elected officials in states with early primaries. It was a key point in Clinton's argument that Obama has not been true to his pledge not to accept lobbyist or PAC money in his run for president. Leadership PACs are political action committees established by members of Congress to support other candidates. Members use the committees to solidify relationships with other members of Congress who might later support them in a run for a leadership post within Congress or in a bid for higher office. Most politicians shelve their leadership PACs once they formally announce their candidacy for president. But Obama didn't. In the months after Obama announced his candidacy on Feb. 10, 2007, Hopefund distributed more than $400,000 to federal and state political candidates and parties. Said Clinton: "In the beginning, he spends 40 percent of the PAC money, 43 percent to be exact, on Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada and South Carolina politicians. Those states constitute 3.7 percent of America's population, after he is a political candidate. And this money did come from lobbyists and special interest groups. "Now, he can say that this is just a blind coincidence, although he admitted that his political action committee consulted with his campaign about how to spend that money out." A PolitiFact analysis of the political contributions made by Obama's Hopefund after Obama officially announced his candidacy found that $185,000 went to Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada and South Carolina (the overwhelming majority went to Iowa, $95,500, and New Hampshire, $82,000). Another $251,000 went to candidates or state parties in 26 other states, according to a review of Hopefund disbursements listed at Opensecrets.org. That means 42.4 percent of Hopefund disbursements were spent in the four states. So Clinton is dead on there. And Clinton rightly notes that these states constitute just 3.7 percent of America's population, according to U.S. Census Bureau data. The implication is that the money was spent only to curry favor with politicians in early-voting states that could give Obama's campaign a boost. "You are building your political clout, so you can call in favors in the future," said Paul Ryan, an attorney for the Campaign Legal Center, a nonpartisan, nonprofit organization that specializes in analyzing campaign finance. In December, the Clinton campaign called on Obama to close Hopefund and contended that the disbursements after Obama announced his candidacy violated election laws. Though no laws specifically require candidates to close their leadership PACs, Ryan said, it is a legal gray area and most politicians shelve them just to be sure. Obama and his staff maintained then that they did nothing improper. The line was muddied some with a Washington Post story on Nov. 30, 2007, that quoted a campaign source acknowledging that Obama's presidential campaign was consulted by Hopefund officials about how to disburse its remaining funds. One can argue whether leadership PAC disbursements to other candidates count as presidential campaigning, or whether the inordinate amounts of money going to states with early primaries proves it — we think they probably do. But we're evaluating Clinton's statement about how much PAC money Obama spent in the early-primary states. And Clinton is pretty much on target when he says 43 percent went to Iowa, New Hampshire, South Carolina and Nevada. We rate his claim True.

pomt-08488	Says the Texas Department of Agriculture seeks to purchase up to 300,000 promotional stress balls.	true	/texas/statements/2010/oct/11/hank-gilbert/hank-gilbert-says-texas-department-agriculture-cou/	Bounciest Democrat on November's statewide ballot? It might be Hank Gilbert, making his second hard charge for state agriculture commissioner versus Todd Staples, the Republican who topped him four years ago. Gilbert, ever prowling for issues, recently trumpeted that the Texas Department of Agriculture is looking at buying thousands of stress balls -- squeezable toys. He said in a Sept. 24 press release: "Make no mistake, Texans love their balls: footballs, baseballs, basketballs, and soccer balls. But 300,000 stress balls? It seems a little extreme, but that's the quantity of grape, barbell, and book-shaped polyurethane stress balls the Texas Department of Agriculture could be spending taxpayer dollars on..." Really? To our inquiry, Gilbert's campaign provided Web links to the agriculture agency's June request for bids as well as a September post on a state website indicating that a $99,000 contract to provide promotional materials was awarded to a Massachusetts company, Oceans Promotions. We downloaded the June 29 bid-request package from a site for state requisitions overseen by the state comptroller's office. The package shows the department was seeking bids to provide up to 300,000 stress "relievers," which we're guessing are not balls because they're not round. Precisely, the package says, the agency sought bids to make "promotional items with logo imprints to follow through on (the) TDA Food and Nutrition Texans Bring It Campaign," with the items to include grape-shaped stress relievers with "Texans Bring It" written on them or "Eating Right," which would be made of polyurethane and be two inches high by three inches wide. The package says a second set of stress relievers, each one called "Dumbbell," would be imprinted "Texans Bring It" and "Exercise" and be five inches high by 1.8 inches in diameter. A third stress reliever would be imprinted "Book" and "Texans Bring It," according to the bid package, while other promotional items would include pencils, buttons and bumperstickers. The package says the bids were sought for various quantities, starting from 2,500 and topping out at 100,000 each. It electronically links to a Branders.com site showing what the agency wanted the stress relievers to look like (our interpretation: bunches of purple grapes). Is all this a real deal? To our inquiry, Bryan Black, Staples' spokesman, replied via e-mail: "An invitation for bid was issued for these federally funded educational items to reduce the $5.8 billion avoidable health care expenditures, paid by taxpayers, associated with overweight and obesity health problems." We followed up with Black, asking if it's accurate to conclude that up to 300,000 of the stress relievers are being purchased. We also wondered why the purchase was being made. Black said he'd limit his comment to his e-mailed statement. Surely the agency would pipe up if Gilbert got its purchase plans wrong. We rate the statement True.

pomt-02636	The General Assembly "has no explicit constitutional authority to impose income, sales, estate and the myriad of other taxes upon us."	true	/rhode-island/statements/2014/jan/19/nicholas-gorham/former-ri-rep-nicholas-gorham-says-state-general-a/	Former state Rep. Nicholas Gorham made a surprising claim last month in a commentary in The Providence Journal. "The fact is that we have a General Assembly that has no explicit constitutional authority to impose income, sales, estate and the myriad of other taxes upon us, yet it taxes the people as if there were no limitations on its authority to tax the people," he wrote in the piece, published Dec. 30. The legislature can’t legally levy taxes? This called for a PolitiFact audit. First, a history lesson. When King Charles II granted a royal charter to the colony in 1663, the document, preserved in a metal and glass case at the State House, established "a form of pure government by an elected assembly presided over by a nearly powerless, elected governor," according to an account on the General Assembly’s website. The Assembly’s supremacy continued when Rhode Island became a state, and was reaffirmed in the state’s first Constitution, adopted in 1842. Article VI, Section 10 spelled it out, saying "the General Assembly shall continue to exercise the powers it has heretofore exercised, unless prohibited in this Constitution." The state Supreme Court consistently interpreted that to mean the power of the General Assembly was unlimited unless authority to do something was specifically given to another branch of government. Things changed in 2004, when the General Assembly, responding to pressure from good government groups, passed "separation of powers" legislation, a set of proposed amendments to the state Constitution. The amendments made it clear the government is divided into three separate branches, banned legislators from serving on any executive-branch boards or commissions, and gave the governor power to appoint members of agency boards. And they eliminated the catch-all Section 10. Voters approved the amendments 2-to-1. So is Gorham right that, because of 2004 vote, the General Assembly lost its "explicit" authority to tax? On a literal level, yes. The only reference to setting taxes in the current Constitution is a section that says that the Assembly can set the manner in which property valuations are conducted. But legal experts say on a practical level, implicit can be as good as explicit. Former state Supreme Court Justice Robert G. Flanders Jr., who stepped down in early 2004, says that although much was changed by the 2004 amendments, much abides. From the days of Parliament and the English kings, he said, the power to levy taxes has rested in the legislative body, a legal tradition that was carried on in England’s colonies in the Americas. "Inherent in the legislative power is the power to tax," Flanders said. "You wouldn’t need an explicit grant." Richard Raspallo, legal counsel to House Majority Leader Nicholas A. Mattiello, agreed, saying there are several examples of legislative power that is assumed despite a lack of specific language in the Constitution. "Where is it explicitly stated in the Constitution that the General Assembly has the authority to require Rhode Island citizens to follow traffic rules, or have a license, or grant people the right to marry, or require people to have certain educational standards in order to work in certain fields?" he said. "At some point, the General Assembly has been granted power by the people to legislate for the common good," he said. "That includes the imposition of taxes to pay for the welfare of the citizenry." Gorham indirectly acknowledged that, but said the ambiguity shows the need for a state constitutional convention to settle the matter definitively. (Voters will be asked in November whether a convention should be convened.) As he wrote in his commentary: "Of course, I plan to pay my taxes, but you really have to wonder sometimes. If the people really wanted to get taxes — and, yes, borrowing — under control and on the people’s terms, the Constitution, just the way it is, would be a great place to start. Let the revolution begin!" Our ruling Nicholas Gorham said the Rhode Island General Assembly ‘‘has no explicit constitutional authority’’ to levy taxes. History tells us he’s right. Had he suggested that the lack of explicit language meant no one had to pay taxes, we’d view his claim in a far different light. But he didn’t, so we rule it True.

"Melania Just Hit Donald Trump With Shocking Announcement He Never Saw Coming," said a realtimepolitics.com headline that failed to deliver. The story is a mixture of gossip and opinion with references to tweets and events related to the Trumps, but does not mention or reveal a "shocking announcement" from Melania Trump. The misleading headline capitalizes on rumors about the couple’s dynamic to trick people into clicking the link. Facebook flagged this story as part of its efforts to combat false news and misinformation on Facebook's News Feed. You can read more about our partnership with Facebook here. "Donald does his best to play nice with his wife when the cameras are rolling, but everyone knows that his marriage is on the rocks and that their marriage essentially enslaves Melania," said the May 6 story on realtimepolitics.com. The post claimed that Rudy Giuliani, Trump’s attorney, "threw the nation a major curveball when he contradicted the president’s story in an interview with Fox News," and that Giuliani "tried to clean up the mess by claiming that Donald was only trying to protect his marriage by burying the false allegations against him." Realtimepolitics.com, which likely is hoping to confuse people with the legitimate website realclearpolitics.com, alludes to remarks Giuliani made on May 2 and May 3 interviews, which PolitiFact looked into, exploring whether a $130,000 payoff to adult film star Stormy Daniels was a campaign expenditure. (Here’s a timeline of Trump’s explanations for the Stormy Daniels payment.) "Will Melania resist being seen with Donald publicly as she did after the first time Donald’s affair with Daniels stole headlines?" said the realtimepolitics.com post. "What is your reaction?"

pomt-06128	"Our tax code is . . . 80,000 pages."	false	/rhode-island/statements/2011/dec/27/barry-hinckley/us-senate-candidate-barry-hinckley-says-nations-ta/	Every year brings another report that the United State's tax code has become so complicated that even the people who work for the Internal Revenue Service don't know what's in it. Part of the reason may be its size. Republican Barry Hinckley, who is running against incumbent Democrat Sheldon Whitehouse, offered a sense of the scope of the code during a Dec. 4 appearance on the WPRI program "Newsmakers." When Rhode Island Public Radio political reporter Ian Donnis asked about the refusal of most Republicans to consider any tax increase, Hinckley said, "Our tax code is desperately broken. It's 80,000 pages. So in my opinion, any effort to continue to tweak something that's broken is a fool's errand to begin with. So trying to raise more money through a busted tax code, I think, is the wrong way to go." Hinckley repeated the 80,000-page claim a few minutes later. It also shows up in a Warwick Beacon story on the candidate. Is the tax code really that long? A lot of estimates can be found on the Internet, ranging from a few thousand pages to more than a million, if you believe the claims of one blogger. But as any student knows who has tried to lengthen a sparse book report by writing with big letters, the number of pages isn't the best gauge. It's the number of words. We went to The Tax Foundation, a pro-business Washington-based research organization that regularly examines the tax burden. They directed us to a report from the Taxpayer Advocate's Service (TAS), an independent organization within the Internal Revenue Service. The service took the Feb. 1, 2010, version of the tax code, written by Congress and formally known as Title 26, copied it into Microsoft Word, and used the "word count" feature to discover that it had 3.8 million words. (The actual length is a bit less because this count includes cross references, captions and descriptions of amendments that don't have the force of law.) So we did the math -- 3.8 million words spread over 80,000 pages would be 48 words per page. That's either really big print or a huge waste of paper. (For a sense of scale, this paragraph contains exactly 48 words and would fill one of those hypothetical pages.) The 3.8 million words produced 11,045 single-spaced pages in Word, which makes Hinckley's estimate more than seven times too high. And if the code were published in a reference book, that would allow for smaller type and more words per page. The government doesn't publish just the code so we went to CCH, a company that specializes in tax law research. Its tax code book, published a year ago, runs 5,368 pages, according to the version we found on Amazon.com. Even that number is too high. CCH spokeswoman Leslie Bonacum said if you strip out indexes and other material that is not part of the code itself. That "leaves us with 5,084 pages of the Internal Revenue Code, as amended, along with amendment notes (written by CCH staff) that details all legislative changes to the code and their effective dates." We wondered if the IRS rules and regulations might increase the total to 80,000 pages. No such luck. CCH's printed copy of the rules and regs, covering six volumes, is listed at 13,880 pages. So the code and regulations combined is fewer than 20,000 pages. (By extrapolation, if you downloaded both and printed them with Word, as the TAS did, it would run to about 40,000 pages, still half of what Hinckley says.) So where did Hinckley get the 80,000-page figure? His spokeswoman sent us links to a Fox Business article and a commentary on a New Jersey website. We found plenty of other references that also used the 80,000-page figure. They simply state it as fact. One source of confusion may be CCH itself. The Hinckley spokeswoman directed us to a colorful chart by CCH that shows how the number of pages in one of its publications, "CCH Standard Federal Tax Reporter," has increased over the years. Its 2011 edition has 72,536 pages. But that publication isn't just the tax code. "That includes the code, regs, annotations to court cases, revenue rulings, explanatory material, other things that come out of the IRS that are not regulations," said Mark Luscombe, principal analyst for the tax and accounting group at CCH. "But some politicians and media have picked that up and called it the code, which is not correct." For example, the website Political Calculations miscalculates by taking the CCH chart and incorrectly presenting it as the number of pages in the tax code itself. That's akin to including everything the Vatican has written about Scripture and using it to claim that the Bible itself (about 1,100 pages) is hundreds of millions of pages long. Our ruling Unlike the U.S. tax code, we'll be brief. Republican U.S. Senate candidate Barry Hinckley said the code is 80,000 pages long, an assertion he made twice on "Newsmakers" and his spokeswoman defends by citing some Internet sources. In reality, it's about 11,000 pages on Microsoft Word and less than half that size in book form. Adding in the IRS's rules and regulations still doesn't bring it close to the length Hinckley says. Only when you include all types of ancillary materials does it begin to approach that legendary length. If Hinckley, whose campaign informed us in an email that the code was 3.7 million words in 2009, had done the math, they would have realized that the code couldn't cover that many pages unless you put fewer than 48 words per page. A few minutes searching Amazon.com would also have uncovered real books -- and page counts -- that were more accurate. The U.S. tax code may be ridiculously long, maddeningly convoluted and overly complex, but Hinckley's count is way off the mark. We rule his claim False. (Get updates from PolitiFactRI on Twitter.

pomt-04302	"There is no war on coal. Period. There are more coal jobs and more coal produced in Ohio than there were five years ago, in spite of the talking points and the yard signs."	true	/ohio/statements/2012/oct/31/sherrod-brown/sherrod-brown-says-coal-jobs-and-coal-production-b/	There is a war on coal, Republicans are telling the public. The story line took center stage during a mid-August campaign stop for Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney in Belmont County. With coal miners standing behind him, Romney attacked the Obama administration saying the Democratic president was developing alternative energy at the expense of the coal industry and heavy-handed in regulating the energy resource. Charges that Democrats have hurt the coal industry have spread to Ohio Senate's race, too. During a U.S. Senate debate held by the City Club of Cleveland on Oct. 16, a questioner asked incumbent Democrat Sherrod Brown how he could support jobs and cheaper energy in Ohio while backing a president that has declared war on coal. Brown fired back saying the "war on coal" rhetoric is empty. "There is no war on coal. Period. There are more coal jobs and more coal produced in Ohio than there were five years ago, in spite of the talking points and the yard signs," he told the audience. Has coal production and the number of coal mining jobs in Ohio really gone up during the time Obama has been in office? PoltiFact Ohio got out the pickaxes and started digging for facts. First, we turned to Brown's campaign to find out the source of Brown's information. Brown campaign spokesman Justin Barasky sent us some information from the Ohio Department of Natural Resources annual coal reports showing that production in 2010 was 28,364,000 tons compared to 22,283,072 tons in 2007. Those same ODNR-produced reports show the monthly employment average for coal mining jobs in Ohio in 2010 was 2,879, compared to a monthly average of 2,204 in 2007. With the 2011 state coal report due out any day, ODNR spokeswoman Heidi Hetzel-Evans was able to tell us that the 2011 report will show that Ohio produced about 27,929,089 tons of coal--a slight drop from the 2010 data that Brown was basing his comment on. Coal mining jobs in Ohio in 2011 were up over the previous year with an average of 2,995 a month, and obviously, both are well ahead of 2007 figures. PolitiFact Ohio also checked with the U.S. Energy Information Administration, which provided a second source of data with even more recent numbers. The EIA estimates coal production for every state on a weekly basis and the October 13 report showed Ohio coal production so far this year up about 1.9 percent over last year. For the most recent 12 months, from October 13, 2011, to October 13, 2012, Ohio has produced about 28,456,000 tons of coal. That matches up fairly closely with the ODNR reports and certainly shows that there hasn't been any fall off in coal production in Ohio in recent months. We also looked for a second source on the coal mining jobs numbers. The Bureau of Labor Statistics keeps a Quarterly Census of Employment and Wages which tracks job numbers in specific industries. For Ohio, the census data showed an average of 2,570 coal mining jobs statewide in 2011. That's almost 30 percent higher than 2007 when the bureau showed only 2,010 coal mining jobs in Ohio. Counted in those statistics are jobs related to the actual mining of coal as well as developing coal mining sites and preparing the coal such as cleaning and screening the coal to be sold. So why has production of Ohio's high-sulfur coal increased in the last few years? Coal industry analysts generally attribute the jump in coal production to an increase in exports to overseas markets such as China and India, which need coal for cheap energy and to use in the steel-making process. So after mining for facts what are we left with? In defending the Democratic record on coal during a debate, Sherrod Brown said coal production and coal jobs in Ohio are up compared to five years ago. After consulting with state and federal statistics, it appears that jobs and coal production in Ohio have increased compared to 2007 levels by every measurement we could find. On the Truth-O-Meter, Browns' statement rates True.	None	Sherrod Brown	None	None	None	2012-10-31T06:00:00	2012-10-16	['Ohio']
pomt-00310	Says "Texas U.S. Rep John Culberson voted to let insurance companies charge people 50 and over five times more than younger people."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2018/sep/24/lizzie-pannill-fletcher/texass-fletcher-tries-hit-culberson-obamacare/	Affordable health care is a salient issue in the 2018 congressional elections, and an ad from a Houston Democrat has a familiar ring. Lizzie Pannill Fletcher, hoping to unseat Republican U.S. Rep. John Culberson in Texas’s 7th Congressional District, says her opponent "is taking a wrecking ball" to a system that needs improvement, not demolition. It’s an ad with a particular appeal to older voters, because Fletcher says in it that "Culberson voted to let insurance companies charge people 50 and over five times more than younger people." Maybe you’ve heard similar claims before. Democrats across the country are using them against their Republican opponents, and PolitiFact has checked out many of them. But we went a little local on this one. Let’s dig in. No discounts for age Fletcher and other Democrats are basing this claim on provisions in the American Health Care Act, passed by the House of Representatives along party lines on May 4, 2017. The bill was rejected in the Senate. The legislation was important for several reasons, but chiefly because it would have changed — and not simply repealed, as earlier bills had attempted — the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010, also known as Obamacare. The new bill would have allowed insurers to charge certain customers over age 50 -- those buying policies in individual and small-group markets -- up to five times as much as they charge their youngest customers. Age has always factored into the price of insurance for the simple reason that older people tend to use more health care services. But the Affordable Care Act, or ACA, limited the age-to-premium ratio: The oldest insurance buyers in the individual and small group markets could be charged no more than three times the premiums as the youngest buyers. Say that premiums for a 20-year-old were $100 a month. A 60-year-old could be charged no more than $300 a month for the same policy under the ACA. Prior to Obamacare, "premiums for older adults were typically four or five times the premiums charged to younger adults," the Kaiser Family Foundation said in a March 2017 report. So the Republican House bill would have lifted the age-permitted ratios closer to where they were before the Affordable Care Act. Gaming this out There were ifs, ands and buts concerning this proposed change. But before we get to them, let’s look at how the age change might have played out if the House bill had become law. We are able to do this because the Kaiser Family Foundation developed a data and mapping tool that allowed for illustrative comparisons of insurance policy costs under the existing and the proposed new laws. This was strictly for people buying policies on the individual market, not for employer-sponsored insurance. We ran scenarios comparing premiums for a silver-tier, or average plan, covering a 27-year-old and a 60-year-old living in Harris County, Texas — the Houston area. As commercials say, actual results might vary, and it’s worth noting that just because the law allows something, it doesn’t mean every situation will match it. In the Kaiser model, premiums for the 27-year-old were $3,340 a year on the individual market under the ACA. Premiums for a 60-year-old were $8,660. That means the 60-year-old’s premiums were about 2.6 times higher than the 27-year-old’s. Under the House bill that Culberson supported, the 60-year-old’s premiums would have jumped to $11,630, while the 27-year-olds would have shrunk to $3,080. That means that in this example, the 60-year-old’s premiums would have been nearly 3.8 times as high as the 27-year-old’s. This illustration shows premiums before accounting for taxpayer subsidies, or "premium tax credits," that many buyers use to offset their costs. The ACA subsidies are based on overall income, but they also take into account federal guidelines for the maximum share of income someone should have to pay for health insurance and the cost of a benchmark plan in his or her area. The House bill that Culberson supported would have changed the subsidy system, basing it solely on age, although subsidies regardless of age would phase out when incomes exceeded $75,000. A number of analyses, including one from the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, said such a change would generally benefit younger buyers and force older buyers to pay more out of pocket for their premiums. Using the Kaiser Family Foundation data tool, we looked again at Houston scenarios for a 27-year-old and a 60-year-old each earning $40,000 a year. The 27-year-old currently doesn't qualify for a subsidy because his income is too high -- relative to the cost of his health coverage -- under the ACA. But under the 2017 House bill, he would have qualified for a $2,000 age-based subsidy. That would have reduced his out-of-pocket costs for premiums to $1,080. A 60-year-old with that same income now qualifies for a $4,580 subsidy. Under the bill Culberson supported, the age-based subsidy would be $4,000. That would put the 60-year-old’s net premiums, after subsidies, at $7,630, seven times more than the 27-year-old’s. Remember, the new law would limit the difference in base premiums, not the amounts due after accounting for subsidies. Would things have played out like this for sure? It depends on the moving parts. This example showed a narrower difference than five-to-one before subsidies, but actual differences change not only by region of the country but sometimes also by county. Nationally, AARP said on the day of the House vote that under the bill, unsubsidized premiums for 60- to 64-year-olds would average almost $18,000 per year, while 20- to 29-year-olds were expected to see average unsubsidized premiums of $4,010 per year. That would make the older group’s premiums 4.5 percent higher than the younger group’s. Our ruling Fletcher was accurate in saying that Culberson voted to "let insurance companies charge people 50 and over five times more than younger people." But she did not mention that the ACA already lets them charge three times more. Her ad also could give the impression that this would have applied to everyone over 50, whereas it only would have affected the individual and small-group markets. It would not have affected large employer plans. And the Republican bill would not have affected people 65 and older because they are covered under Medicare, the national program for seniors.

pomt-02635	Action by the Milwaukee County Board will "provide the County Executive with the same level of security as the Governor and the Mayor of Milwaukee while saving taxpayers $300,000."	pants on fire!	/wisconsin/statements/2014/jan/19/david-cullen/cullen-says-abele-security-detail-equals-those-gov/	Sometimes it seems everything’s a fight at the Milwaukee County Courthouse. During last fall’s budget battle, even County Executive Chris Abele’s request for a personal security detail provided by a private firm or local law enforcement touched off a tussle. Sheriff David A. Clarke Jr.’s reaction was basically no way: "I won't spend one penny of taxpayer money on Abele's self-importance exercise." Supervisor Jason Haas said Abele was wealthy enough to pay for his own security. Others noted Scott Walker had no security when he had Abele’s job. Abele said he’d received threats. The County Board ultimately carved 75% from Abele’s plan for $400,000 worth of protection and assigned the duty to -- who else? -- Clarke’s office, then overrode an Abele veto to make it happen. After tempers cooled, County Supervisor David Cullen portrayed the outcome as a victory for Abele and the taxpayers. "The County Executive also requested $400,000 for his personal security," Cullen wrote in his year-end 2013 newsletter to constituents. "The Board allocated $100,000 from the Sheriff's budget for this purpose. This will provide the County Executive with the same level of security as the Governor and the Mayor of Milwaukee while saving taxpayers $300,000." We can’t say what the appropriate level of spending is. But let’s check that last statement by the county supervisor. Did the move provide the same level of security, while saving money? How spending compares For the record, Abele believes the County Board-approved plan is inadequate. His spokesman, Brendan Conway, said Milwaukee Police officials privately estimated -- based on what it costs to protect Mayor Tom Barrett -- that it would cost $400,000 to protect Abele. MPD spokesman Mark Stanmeyer told us that the $400,000 figure (it’s $500,000 including overtime) includes police presence in the entire municipal complex, not just for protecting and driving Barrett to events. Officers are stationed at the Treasurer’s office, for instance. It’s clear, though, from what police tell us that a significant chunk of the $400,000 covers Barrett, and that multiple officers are part of the team that protects and escorts him. By contrast, the county plan is limited to $100,000 and county supervisors say they were told the funds would cover salary and benefits for the equivalent of one full-time deputy. In addition, Conway said Clarke so far is talking about an on-call system, not a body attached to the exec’s office. In addition, Abele would only be escorted when outside the Courthouse. That would be different than the City Hall setup, where police provide security for Barrett both while working in his office and outside City Hall at various functions. As for Walker, who was elected governor in 2010, it’s clear that his security costs greatly exceed $100,000. Factors include a large increase in threats he and his family reported receiving in the wake of his Act 10 collective bargaining law, and the fact that his two sons lived at home in suburban Milwaukee during the height of the protests over the law. The governor has maintained separate residences in Madison and Wauwatosa. The costs of the governor's security detail totaled $611,400 over the 10 months from Walker's election in November 2010 to the end of August 2011, the Journal Sentinel reported at the time. That also covers the lieutenant governor, Rebecca Kleefisch. That was more than twice as much as it cost to protect then-Democratic Gov. Jim Doyle over the comparable 10-month period from November 2009 to August 2010. We could not get updated figures. In 2013, a state transportation spokesperson told the Capital Times that the State Patrol unit responsible for providing security for the governor, lieutenant governor and visiting dignitaries has doubled its staffing from five to 10 since Walker took office. As is readily evident to the public, a State Trooper squad is a fixture in the driveway of the Walkers’ home in Wauwatosa. In light of these facts, we asked Cullen about his newsletter claim that Abele would get "the same level of security" as Barrett and Walker. He told us he "may have chosen my words inartfully," explaining that he meant only that professional law enforcement would protect Abele just as it does Walker and Barrett. "I wasn’t necessarily arguing it was the same level of man hours the governor or mayor gets," Cullen said. A day later, Cullen said it was possible the county and city security could be more comparable than at first blush. The comparison is not as straightforward as it seems, he said, because the county figure ($100,000) doesn’t include spending on the security checkpoints at the public entrances to the Courthouse. Those checkpoints, staffed primarily by security-trained county facilities employees and lately with help from sheriff’s deputies, give the Courthouse a security dimension lacking at City Hall. True, but it’s hard to get past the fact that Barrett gets close personal attention inside and outside City Hall, while Abele would only have escorts outside the Courthouse -- and possibly only on an on-call basis. In sum, we think Cullen’s claim would read to most people as comparable security presence for Abele and the other two officials, and it falls way short of that. Is it a savings? What about the $300,000 savings Cullen claimed from the County Board’s action? He bragged about it in his newsletter under the headline, "County Board Adopts a no-tax increase Budget While Protecting Core Services." While it’s true the board slashed Abele’s security request by that amount, the money was not used for tax relief. Instead, the money went for new spending: The County Board shifted the $300,000 through a budget amendment to beef up the county’s existing support of emergency homeless shelters. Finally, what will happen now that Abele and Clarke -- bitter personal and political rivals -- have to work out a security plan? Clarke told us he’s still angry that Abele eliminated the sheriff’s department’s dignitary protection unit in the 2012 election year, opening Clarke to criticism about not fully participating in security when President Obama visited the area. "Now in his narcissistic way (Abele) feels his security should be funded without question as to cost," Clarke told us. Conway’s response: Clarke has made clear he has the authority to provide whatever function he wants. Clarke, who is certified in dignitary protection work, declined to discuss how the department would arrange protection for Abele, citing the need to keep such details secret for safety reasons. He called it a "gross breach of security" for Conway to discuss it with the media. Last fall, an Abele aide told county supervisors Abele would want to hand-pick the sheriff’s deputy assigned to him. We’ll have to stay tuned to see if he picks the sheriff for the job. Our rating Cullen said action by the Milwaukee County Board will "provide the County Executive with the same level of security as the Governor and the Mayor of Milwaukee while saving taxpayers $300,000." There are major problems with the claim, which Cullen acknowledges was poorly phrased. Cullen emphasized how much the County Board’s action would save taxpayers, but there is no real savings. It actually costs taxpayers more money. Abele’s personal security would fall far short of the governor’s and also appears to be less intense than that accorded to Mayor Tom Barrett. Cullen now says he meant only that Abele would have law enforcement security as do those two officials. But his newsletter said "same level." For these reasons, we rate his statement Pants on Fire.

pomt-10638	"Mike Huckabee raised taxes on dog groomers!"	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/jan/07/spike-romney-attack-dog/barking-up-the-right-tree/	Who sends a dog to do their bidding? A cute, ribbon-in-its-hair Yorkie named Spike, at that? Mitt Romney. Yes, in his latest round of yapping with rival Mike Huckabee, Romney sent Iowa voters a mailer that assails Huckabee's tax record and, more notably, features many adorable pictures of Spike: "Dear Iowa Republican ... " it begins, "At the risk of making Chuck Norris angry, I must disagree with his endorsement of Mike Huckabee for President. (Please stick with me here. If putting Chuck Norris in a television ad makes sense, a dog responding in a mailing makes just as much sense.)" It's signed: "Bow wow, Spike" with a paw print. Now we know Iowa is passe, but given New Hampshire's antitax climate, we wouldn't be surprised to see this attack ad in a few Nashua mailboxes. And we can't help but give Romney points for humor. This is the joke attack ad style the Hillary Clinton campaign missed out on when it dug up quotes from Sen. Barack Obama's kindergarten teacher to prove he's been aiming for the White House longer than he admits. (True!) But, back to Spike. He attacks Huckabee for "all the different taxes" he raised as governor of Arkansas, including the one that really gets him: the tax on dog groomers. (We checked Huckabee's record on the other tax increases here. ) "Sales tax. Gas tax. Groceries tax. Even the tax on nursing home beds. Fine," Spike writes. "But he went too far when he taxed the people who make me beautiful!" Would you believe Spike is barking up the right tree? A number of services were made subject to the Arkansas state sales tax with Act 107 of the 2003 legislative session. Wrecker and towing services. Body piercing, tattooing and electrolysis services. Locksmith services. And, pet grooming and kennel services. As of July 1, 2004, charges for those services and nine others named in the legislation are subject to a 6 percent state sales tax, all part of an effort to generate revenue to balance the budget in the face of a dramatic projected budget shortfall. "Like most states at that time, revenues were dropping, so they levied (additional taxes)," said Tom Atchley, excise tax administrator for the Arkansas Department of Finance and Administration. Act 107 became law on Feb. 12, 2004, without a signature from then-Gov. Huckabee, who has said he had little choice but to accept the tax increases because Arkansas state law requires a balanced budget. Still, no bones about it, Spike makes a solid case. And Romney scores a funny jab. If you'd like to see the mailer, which is worth a peek, it's posted at the Washington Post blog "The Trail" here. But because Huckabee didn't sign the law, we can't say Huckabee himself put a tax on dog groomers. But he didn't stop it either, so we rule Spike's statement Mostly True.

pomt-15106	Georgia’s CRCT "set some of the lowest expectations for student proficiency in the nation."	true	/georgia/statements/2015/sep/15/richard-woods/woods-claim-backed-reports-crct-wasnt-challenging-/	The state announced the first round of the Georgia Milestones tests on Sept. 3 and, as predicted, scores were low. Only 10 percent of students who took a language arts or science course at any grade level finished in the top category of distinguished learners. In math, 60 percent of all Georgia students scored as beginning or developing learners. State School Superintendent Richard Woods said the new test sets standards that are higher, more comparable nationally and essential if students are to be college- and career-ready. "Our previous assessment, the CRCT, set some of the lowest expectations for student proficiency in the nation, and that cannot continue," Woods said in the press release announcing the results. The Criterion-Referenced Competency Tests, or CRCT, is infamous for being central to the Atlanta Public Schools test-cheating scandals. Dozens of teachers and administrators risked careers and criminal prosecution changing CRCT scores to avoid losing bonus pay, even jobs. More than 20 educators pleaded guilty to reduced charges in the scandal. Eleven others were convicted in April on racketeering and other charges, receiving sentences from probation to three years in prison. Some are appealing. With all that said, did the CRCT really set some of the nation’s lowest expectations for student proficiency, as Woods suggests? ( Keep in mind that an easy test can still be failed.) First a little background about the CRCT. It stood as one of the primary measures of student achievement in Georgia from 2000 until it was retired in Summer 2014. The multiple-choice tests also were used to determine whether schools made adequate yearly progress (AYP), the benchmark of success under the federal No Child Left Behind law. The A-Plus Education Reform Act of 2000, pushed by former Gov. Roy Barnes, required all Georgia students in grades 1 to 8 to take the CRCT in reading, English/language arts and math. Students in grades 3 through 8 also were tested in science and social studies. A writing test was required in grades 3, 5, 8 and 11. Passing the CRCT was required for promotion to the next grade for students in grades 3 (reading) and 5 and 8 (reading and math). Who knew? Answer: Many Woods, who became state superintendent in January, isn’t saying something about the CRCT that hasn’t been said for years by some parents, teachers and certainly educators and education researchers/advocates. What was the tell-tale sign that the test was too easy? It was the wide gulf between passing rates on the CRCT and the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP), considered the gold standard of tests. The Education Trust in Washington D.C. raised a red flag back in 2006. The non-profit pointed out, for example, that 87 percent of Georgia fourth-graders were considered "proficient" in reading on the CRCT, but only 26 percent of a sampling of those same students were proficient on the 2005 NAEP reading test. (If the two tests had the same expectations, there should be a minimal gap. Wide disparities in results on the state and national test are referred to as the "honesty gap.") State officials at the time said the report findings could lead to a strengthening of the test. If that happened, it doesn’t appear to have shown up in the data. A subsequent report from the group, relying on 2011 data, showed about the same results. Nearly 90 percent of students met standards on the CRCT, but only 32 percent did so on NAEP. It wasn’t a state secret either Our research turned up a report from the Governor’s Office of Student Achievement, "A Snapshot of K-8 Academic Achievement in Georgia." The report said that performance on the CRCT had improved modestly between 2009-10 and 2012-13. But it said a comparison with national tests showed that Georgia set a low bar for proficiency on the CRCT and still ranked in the bottom half of national comparisons on NAEP. The report pointed out that a recent Education Next study found Georgia had the lowest mathematics and reading cut scores in the nation. (Georgia students had to answer fewer test questions right to pass the test, or be classified as proficient. About 50 percent was standard.) For 2013, the most recent year for which data is available, here's what a NAEP Mapping Study showed: (This study uses NAEP as a common scale to compare one state’s expectations of what their students should know and be able to do in order to be considered "proficient" on their state assessments to other states.) -- Georgia had the lowest numeric 4th grade reading expectations in the nation (Proficiency by NAEP standards was a scale score equivalent of 238 or better. But researchers found Georgia classified students who scored 167 or above, as proficient. No other state had that low a bar.); -- Georgia was third from the bottom on 4th grade math expectations (Georgia's NAEP scale score equivalent of 210 was numerically better than Maryland's and Alabama's; top was Texas at 256); -- Georgia was last in 8th grade reading expectations (Georgia had a NAEP scale score equivalent of 199 and was a distant last at that, with Idaho the next lowest at 217. Best was New York at 282 out of possible 500); -- and Georgia numerically ranked third from the bottom in 8th grade math expectations. (The state's NAEP scale score equivalent was 245, which is tied with Alabama, 245, and was followed by Connecticut, 244. Best was New York at 304, out of a possible 500.) "Too many students were labeled as proficient when, in reality, they had not fully mastered the standards and needed additional support," Woods said recently. "That hurt our kids who need to be competitive with others across the country and hurt our teachers by making it difficult for them to have a true picture of the academic strengths and weakness of their students." Our ruling There’s ample evidence that, for years, Georgia’s CRCT "set some of the lowest expectations for student proficiency in the nation," as research has repeatedly shown and State Superintendent Richard Woods stated last week. We rate Woods’ statement True.	None	Richard Woods	None	None	None	2015-09-15T00:00:00	2015-09-02	['None']
pomt-05959	"Right now in Georgia, nearly one in three leaving our prisons are re-convicted within three years."	true	/georgia/statements/2012/jan/25/nathan-deal/deal-makes-arresting-claim-about-ga-prisons/	Crime may not pay, but it sure costs Georgia a lot of money. In some cases, too much, says Gov. Nathan Deal. During his second State of the State address earlier this month, Deal said Georgia has one of the biggest prison populations in the nation. Housing those prisoners costs money, which troubles state leaders as Georgia wades through an uncertain economy. Still, Deal said far too many of these inmates are former Georgia inmates who are committing crimes and being sent back to prison. "[H]istory has shown that offenders simply return to the prison population," the governor said. "Right now in Georgia, nearly one in three leaving our prisons are re-convicted within three years." One in three are re-convicted within three years? We decided to fact-check this claim. Criminal justice reform will be one of the top items on the menu for state lawmakers to chew on this legislative session. Georgia currently spends about $1 billion a year on corrections, state officials say. That is more than double the $492 million the state spent on correctional services in 1990. The growth in corrections spending is second behind Medicaid, state officials said. Many believe it is unsustainable. During the past two decades, Georgia’s prison population has more than doubled to 56,000 inmates despite a decrease in crime rates in the past 10 years, according to a state report released in November. "If current policies remain in place, analysis indicates that Georgia’s prison population will rise by another 8 percent to reach nearly 60,000 inmates by 2016, presenting the state with the need to spend an additional $264 million to expand capacity," the report said. Last year, the Pew Center on the States released a widely reported study on recidivism rates. In 1999, nearly 17,000 people were released from Georgia state prisons, the study reported. Thirty-eight percent of those released were incarcerated again within three years, Pew found. In 2004, about 19,000 men and women were released from state prisons in Georgia. About 35 percent of them were back in prison by 2007, Pew found. Those numbers seemed dated, so PolitiFact Georgia searched for some more recent information. The Georgia Department of Corrections website’s most recent data is through fiscal year 2008. The recidivism rate within three years for state prisons, where the largest percentage of Georgia prisoners is held, was 27.5 percent, the state’s website says. The recidivism rate in most of the other categories of prisons ranged from 22 to 25 percent. Probation boot camps were the only types of prisons with a recidivism rate of one-third. In Georgia, most of the people who were sent back to prison went for a technical violation, according to the Pew report. Georgia’s probation sentences -- about seven years -- are almost twice the national average, the state report found. In 2010, state courts sent more than 5,000 lower-risk drug and property offenders to prison who had never been to prison before, accounting for 25 percent of all admissions, according to the state report. The state report suggested giving judges more sentencing options -- such as probation -- for low-level, nonviolent drug possession offenders -- which might reduce the recidivism rate. "This option would reduce the growth of the prison population by approximately 300 to 900 additional beds," the state report said. The Pew report on recidivism is more than one-third, which helps any argument that Deal would make that his statement is correct. The most recent state data shows the recidivism rate is slightly less than one-third. The governor said in his speech that the rate was "nearly" one in three. We believe all of the numbers we saw support his statement. Our rating: True.	None	Nathan Deal	None	None	None	2012-01-25T06:00:00	2012-01-10	['Georgia_(U.S._state)']
pomt-05691	"A clear majority of Americans support removing the cost-sharing requirement for prescription contraceptive coverage."	mostly true	/new-jersey/statements/2012/mar/12/rush-holt/rush-holt-claims-clear-majority-americans-support-/	U.S. Rep. Rush Holt says the federal mandate requiring most health care plans to offer free contraceptive coverage makes sense. And he claims a majority of Americans agree with him. Fierce debate on the issue erupted when guidelines issued by the U.S. Health and Human Services Department that required insurance plans to cover birth control as preventive services, without co-pays or deductibles, were made final without exemptions for some employers with religious affiliations. On Feb. 10, President Barack Obama announced a compromise: if a religious-affiliated employer objected to providing contraceptive coverage, the responsibility would fall on the insurance company. In a Feb. 24 e-mail newsletter explaining his support for Obama’s decision, Holt (D- 12th Dist.) said: "Nearly all American women, including women of faith, have used contraception sometimes, and a clear majority of Americans support removing the cost-sharing requirement for prescription contraceptive coverage." Our colleagues at PolitiFact national recently ruled on a claim that addressed the first half of Holt’s statement. A White House official said: "Most women, including 98 percent of Catholic women, have used contraception." That claim earned a Mostly True. With the birth control plan still under fierce scrutiny, we questioned Holt’s other claim. Despite all the rancor, do Americans favor the plan? Holt’s spokesman, Thomas Seay, pointed to a February health tracking poll from the Kaiser Family Foundation that found that 63 percent of respondents support the "new federal requirement that private health insurance plans cover the cost of birth control" and 33 percent oppose it. The margin of error was 3 percentage points. But that’s just one poll of 1,519 adults. We found seven other surveys that asked respondents about their views on requiring health care plans to cover birth control. Five support Holt’s claim. A CBS News/New York Times poll found an even larger majority of Americans -- 66 percent -- support the plan requiring private health insurance plans to cover the full cost of birth control. About a quarter of respondents opposed the plan, with a margin of error of 3 percentage points. When asked specifically about the same requirement for employers with religious affiliations, support decreased slightly, with 61 percent in favor and 31 percent opposed. A recent Fox News poll found 61 percent of respondents supported "requiring employer health plans to cover birth control for women" and 34 percent opposed. The poll had a margin of error of 3 percentage points. A survey by the Democratic firm Public Policy Polling conducted on behalf of Planned Parenthood and a poll by the Public Religion Research Institute both found majorities in support of employers providing health care plans that would cover the cost of birth control. Another poll conducted for NBC News and the Wall Street Journal found 53 percent of respondents favored the requirement and 33 percent opposed it, with a margin of error of 3.5 percentage points. That’s a majority, but one that could possibly be affected by the margin of error. Two of the polls we reviewed found opposition to providing free birth control coverage. A Quinnipiac University poll with a margin of error of 1.9 percentage points found a split of 47 percent in support of requiring private employers to offer free birth control coverage and 48 percent opposed. A poll conducted by Rasmussen Reports -- widely considered Republican-leaning -- found 46 percent opposed the plan and 43 percent supported it. The survey had a margin of error of 3 percentage points. Our ruling Holt said "a clear majority of Americans support removing the cost-sharing requirement for prescription contraceptive coverage." We found eight polls that recently asked respondents whether they supported or opposed requiring health care plans to cover the cost of birth control. In six of those surveys there was majority support, only one of which could be impacted by a margin of error. Two others polls showed more opposition than support. Still, Holt’s claim is backed by most of the polls we reviewed. Overall, this claim is Mostly True. To comment on this ruling, go to NJ.com.

pomt-02658	"Sens. Isakson’s, Chambliss’ Votes Against Unemployment Insurance Were Votes to Kill Nearly 6,000 Georgia Jobs."	half-true	/georgia/statements/2014/jan/14/americans-united-change/group-claims-georgia-jobs-risk-if-benefits-not-ext/	When lawmakers returned to Congress after the new year, Democrats and Republicans went back to their corners and began sparring over whether to extend unemployment benefits. Georgia’s two U.S. senators, Republicans Saxby Chambliss and Johnny Isakson, both opposed a Democratic-led $6.4 billion proposal to extend the benefits, which expired Dec. 28. Americans United for Change, a liberal advocacy group, promptly sent out a press release decrying the senators’ votes. The group included a claim about the economic impact to Georgia about extending those benefits that put PolitiFact Georgia and its Truth-O-Meter to work. "Sens. Isakson’s, Chambliss’ Votes Against Unemployment Insurance Were Votes to Kill Nearly 6,000 Georgia Jobs," Americans United for Change wrote in the headline. Is that true, we wondered? Georgians now are eligible for a maximum of 18 weeks of state-based unemployment insurance, The Atlanta Journal-Constitution reported. Congress typically enacts extended federal benefits during recessions, and the expired benefits ran for a maximum of 47 additional weeks. Chambliss and Isakson have supported a GOP proposal to pay for a $6.4 billion long-term unemployment insurance extension and to restore $6 billion in cost-of-living increases for early military pensions. They would pay for that by preventing illegal immigrants from claiming a tax credit for their children. Americans United for Change based its claim on a report on the White House website pushing the extension. Called "The Economic Benefits of Extending Unemployment Benefits," the report outlines how many jobs would be saved in 2014 by continuing the insurance. In Georgia, the total was 5,876. Nationally, the impact is 240,000 jobs, the report says. The report was written by the U.S. Labor Department and the Council of Economic Advisors. Without the additional unemployment insurance, many of those jobless workers would seek help from other federal programs, such as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, formerly known as the food stamp program. White House officials pointed to a report by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office to support the claim. The CBO released a report in December that concluded extending unemployment benefits through the end of 2014 would add about 200,000 jobs nationwide. That estimate is slightly lower but pretty close to the report on the White House website. The CBO and White House reports use the amount of money spent in each state from unemployment insurance and estimate how many jobs it will create or save. Unemployment benefits have a trickle-down effect on the economy, some say. The money those unemployed recipients receive in benefits is used to buy groceries and other services that keep others employed or can create additional jobs. "Who provides goods and services? Workers," said Heidi Shierholz, an economist for the Economic Policy Institute, a generally left-leaning, Washington-based nonprofit that supports extending the benefits. The institute has done its own research on the topic. It concluded 310,000 jobs would be created. Shierholz, who co-wrote the report, said her group used federal data and added a multiplier to come up with its estimate. Shierholz said the Obama administration report used what she described as "standard" methodology to come up with its estimate. "Their overall numbers make sense," Shierholz told us. University of Georgia professor Jeffrey Dorfman was not so convinced about the effectiveness of extending the benefits. He said if you believe that deficit spending will boost the economy, "then the methodology used is correct and reasonably well done." "I personally think these models far overstate the benefits of deficit spending because they do not account for the cost of the lost spending by whoever would have borrowed the money if the government hadn't borrowed it first," Dorfman said via email. "We see the benefits of the government spending but do not see the jobs that would have been created in the private sector instead." He also questioned the logic of extending the benefits. "Extended unemployment payments are currently scored at $6.5 billion for a 3 month extension. If we figure $26 billion for the whole year versus the 240,000 jobs that the White House says will be ‘saved or created’ by that spending, that works out to $108,333 per job," Dorfman said. "Clearly, we would be better off if the federal government just randomly picked 240,000 long term unemployed people and gave them government jobs at say $40,000 per year." To sum up, Americans United for Change claimed extending unemployment benefits would save nearly 6,000 Georgia jobs this year. The claim was based on a federal report. Other nationwide estimates suggest the jobs number in the report is on target. But it is still an estimate that’s based on economic projections. And the overreaching point by American United for Change neglects the fact that Isakson and Chambliss back a GOP plan that would also extend jobless benefits. With those caveats, we rate this claim Half True.	None	Americans United for Change	None	None	None	2014-01-14T00:00:00	2014-01-14	['None']
pomt-03150	"We've seen priests beheaded by the Islamic rebels on the other side. We've also seen an Islamic rebel eating the heart of a soldier."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2013/sep/10/rand-paul/rand-paul-syrian-rebels-behead-priests-and-eat-hea/	A major conundrum facing the United States in Syria is the prevalence of Islamic extremists, some with links to al-Qaida, among the rebel forces. Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., said Syrian President Bashar Assad is probably a war criminal but some of his opponents are equally dangerous. "We've seen priests beheaded by the Islamic rebels on the other side," Paul said on the inaugural edition of CNN’s relaunched Crossfire. "We've also seen an Islamic rebel eating the heart of a soldier." These are dramatic and gruesome claims that have great staying power on the Web, so we decided to see if we could verify them. The short answer is that rebels gunned down a priest but didn’t behead him. And a rebel commander made a show of cutting organs from a dead Syrian soldier but denies actually taking a bite. The Franciscan priest A California-based news service called Catholic Online was one of the first to report the beheading of Francois Murad, a priest at a monastery in northern Syria. The killing took place on June 23, 2013, and the article appeared on June 30. There was graphic video of three men kneeling on the ground. As a crowd cheers, rebels cut their heads off. The early reports claimed the Vatican confirmed the death of the priest and took that to be confirmation that he was beheaded. The Blaze, the website of conservative talk show host Glenn Beck, carried an item of its own on June 30. The headline couched the claim as "allegedly" but the first line of the article was slightly less reserved with "Syrian Catholic priest Francois Murad killed last weekend by jihadi fighters was beheaded, according to a report by Catholic Online, which is linking to video purportedly showing the brutal murder." The Blaze article garnered nearly 41,000 re-postings on Facebook. Other websites followed with their own versions on July 1. But a more accurate account was available within hours of the original report. On June 30, an editor for the British newspaper The Telegraph, initially linked to the story of the beheading, and then issued this correction: "I need to update and correct reports that Fr. Francois Murad, a Franciscan friar, was beheaded last week. The priest was actually shot inside his church, it seems – and the video of a beheading, which went viral, does not depict him. The Vatican was widely quoted as confirming the beheading, but an investigation by the Telegraph's Ruth Sherlock has established that this attribution was false." We found no dispute that a jihadi group, Jabhat al-Nusra, conducted the attack. Murad was shot eight times. A fellow Franciscan collected his body, and he was buried in a nearby village. By July 2, CNN also aimed to set the record straight. An article emphasized that the rebels had killed but not beheaded the priest. The next day, two other news operations followed up with their own corrections: the right-leaning CNSnews.com ("Syrian Rebels Did Not Behead Franciscan Priest--They Shot Him 8 Times") and the New York Daily News ("Catholic priest NOT among three beheaded on video by Syrian rebels, says head friar") . Nevertheless, as recently as this past week, a columnist for the conservative website Townhall had the headline "Syrian rebels attack Christian village, behead priests." A heart or other organ Paul’s second example hews more closely to the facts. On May 12, Time reported on a video that its reporters had seen earlier but was posted anonymously on the Web that day. In the video, a rebel cuts open the body of a dead Syrian soldier and removes two bloody masses. The rebel, who has taken the nom de guerre, Abu Sakkar, says to the cell phone camera, "I swear to God we will eat your hearts and your livers, you soldiers of Bashar the dog." His men shout "Allahu akbar (God is great)." Sakkar then lifts one of the lumps of flesh to his mouth. Multiple news organizations carried the story and an edited version of the video. Time interviewed Sakkar via Skype on May 14. He did not deny what he had done. He explained that he felt his behavior was justified because his men had found a cell phone on the dead man with him abusing three naked women, a mother and her two daughters. "We opened his cell phone, and I found a clip of a woman and her two daughters fully naked and he was humiliating them, and sticking a stick here and there," Sakkar told Time. Two months later, a BBC reporter spoke face-to-face with Sakkar. Sakkar at that time said, "I didn't bite into it. I just held it for show." However, days after the video went public, he had told the BBC that he had taken a ritual bite. The video available to us makes it impossible to tell for sure. It is also unclear what body parts he was holding. Sakkar told the BBC it was a lung; a doctor who saw the video told the BBC that’s what it looked like to him. Sakkar is the founder of the Omar al-Farouq brigade, a group of about 60 men. According to Time, the man who posted the video described him as affiliated with al-Qaida. How close he actually is to al-Qaida is unclear. The person who put the video online added the caption, "These are the freedoms they want to import to our country." Time reported that graphic videos of this sort have become familiar among combatants on both sides of the Syrian civil war. "Footage of rape, torture and amputations are passed like trading cards," said Nadim Houry of Human Rights Watch. There is no question that such videos travel widely. Beck featured the video of Sakkar on his radio program as a clear warning against being drawn into a war in the Middle East. Beck urged viewers to share it with their friends and to contact their representatives in Congress. Paul's office sent us a statement that read, in part, "To get caught up in the specifics of which organ was eaten or how, or the manner in which an innocent priest was murdered is to miss the truth to argue over the details: that atrocities have been committed by both sides of this civil war." Our ruling Paul said Islamic rebels have decapitated priests, and one was seen eating the heart of a Syrian soldier. News reports show that Islamic rebels gunned down a priest but did not behead him. The murder of a priest speaks to religious warfare and that carries great weight. However, thousands of innocent people have died from gunfire in this civil war. The claim is evocative in part due to the beheading, and that aspect is plainly inaccurate. In addition, the truth has been widely available for two months and Paul had ample opportunity to know better. Paul’s claim about a rebel eating a heart is more accurate, but the details are sketchy. Both the focus on a heart and the idea of cannibalism push strong emotional buttons. But it might not have been a heart, and there might not have been an actual bite. Still, a rebel carved up a dead Syrian soldier, boasted about it as he did so, and at the very least, spoke and acted as though he were eating the dead man’s liver and heart. The first statement is flawed, and the second is largely on the mark with some weak points. Together, we rate them as Half True.

pomt-03874	Says the Georgia Dome would need up to $350 million in work over the next five to seven years.	half-true	/georgia/statements/2013/mar/08/kasim-reed/would-new-stadium-be-cheaper-dome-rehab-depends/	To build new or to renovate the old? PolitiFact Georgia has examined the question before in the case of the proposed $1 billion Falcons stadium. The issue then was a claim by Atlanta’s chief operating officer about how much upfront public money is typically invested in these types of projects. The debate continues. This time we examine a claim made by Atlanta Mayor Kasim Reed about construction costs. Reed, a staunch supporter of a new stadium, has said that renovating the 21-year-old Georgia Dome, where the Falcons currently play, is a bad idea. Reed said the renovation would cost more than the upfront public funding portion of a new stadium. Reed says the Dome would need up to $350 million in work over the next five to seven years, based on information from the Georgia World Congress Center Authority, the Dome’s owner. Politifact Georgia decided to investigate the estimates for a renovated Georgia Dome. We wanted to know how those renovations compare with construction of a new stadium. Under the deal that was reached this week, the Falcons would contribute $800 million toward the proposed $1 billion stadium. Team owner Arthur Blank sits on the board of directors of Cox Enterprises, which owns The Atlanta Journal-Constitution. The publicly funded portion of the new retractable-roof stadium would be $200 million in bonds issued by the city and backed by hotel-motel tax revenue. The Falcons would assume responsibility for $50 million in infrastructure costs. The Blank Family Foundation would invest $15 million in projects for neighborhoods around the stadium; the city’s economic development agency would commit another $15 million. The deal also calls for at least 31 percent minority and women business participation in the design and construction work. The Atlanta City Council would have to approve a funding deal. The Falcons want a new stadium in time for the 2017 football season, when their lease expires at the Georgia Dome. PolitiFact Georgia asked Reed’s office about his source for the renovation figures. It pointed us to a 2010 master plan study of the Dome commissioned by the GWCCA. That study examined what a new NFL stadium program would look like and the costs for getting the Dome to that level. That study included the following expanded/renovated Dome budget: New additional area: $118,100,000 (369,000 square feet) Major renovation: $145,600,000 Minor renovation: $ 23,200,000 Seating Bowl/Field: $ 25,000,000 Replace Roof Fabric: $ 30,000,000 Soft Costs, fees, etc (15%): $ 51,300,000 Total: $393,200,000 The total does not include year-to-year cost increases, parking lots and garages, or land. It also does not include an optional $200 million retractable roof. The commissioned studies were completed by Kansas City, Mo.-based Populous, one of the largest stadium builders in the nation. The company is now a finalist in the GWCCA’s selection process for a lead architect. Populous was not asked to itemize specific work under the "major" and "minor" renovation categories, said a spokeswoman representing the GWCCA. With updated features and arrangements, the study allows for a seating capacity of 65,000 seats with the possibility for expansion to 75,000 seats.The Georgia Dome currently has 71,250 seats Another GWCCA-commissioned report, released in February 2011, focused on a new open-air stadium, but it also examined continued maintenance and improvements at the Georgia Dome over the next 20 years. That study found that from 2011 to 2020, $44.5 million in maintenance work would be needed to retain the Dome at "today’s level of quality. An additional $35 million to $70 million in capital improvements -- such as a new roof, plumbing and technology upgrades and food service equipment -- would also be needed during the same time period to keep the Dome a competitive venue over the next decade, the report said. Over the past 16 years, combined maintenance projects and improvement projects at the Dome have equaled $71,430,000, according to the report. Initially, the 2010 budget document sent to us from the mayor’s office and included in the 2010 report listed an incorrect figure for a cost sub total. Politifact Georgia caught the error while doing our own math on the numbers, and Populous revised the document. Depending on your assumptions, it’s easy to inflate the costs of an old facility, said Neil deMause, an author and blogger who monitors -- and has been critical of -- sports facility deals across the country. "Are your stated costs just to maintain (the facility), doing some upgrades or completely gutting it and making it look like a new facility?" he said. "The Falcons are playing in the Dome now, and it doesn’t look like it’s falling down. Could you spend less than $100 million and upgrade it? I don’t know, nobody has asked that question." The argument for stadium upgrades across the nation has been met with mixed results lately. As part of a stadium extension deal approved late last year, the Buffalo Bills will receive $94 million in public funds as part of a $130 million renovation. This week, North Carolina’s governor denied the use of public money for renovation of the Carolina Panthers’ Bank of America Stadium. The team had asked for $62.5 million as part of a $250 million renovation deal. Also this week, senators in Miami are proposing a referendum be approved before hotel-motel taxes are used to fund renovations at the Dolphins’ stadium. And although arbitrators sided last month with the St. Louis Rams for $700 million in renovations at the Edward Jones Dome, some officials think the money would be better spent on a new facility. Rodney Fort, co-director of the University of Michigan’s Center for Sports Management said the idea a stadium renovation would be more expensive than building a new facility is difficult to contemplate. But if you cannot get the same flow of value no matter how you renovate, then you’re comparing apples to oranges, he said. Ultimately, we return to the original question: To build new or to renovate? The mayor says the (Georgia) Dome would need up to $350 million in work over the next five to seven years. That amount is more than the cost of the upfront public money ($200 million) that could be needed for a proposed $1 billion Falcons stadium. Reed cites figures from a 2010 study that puts the Dome’s renovation costs at about $393 million. Those renovations would include 369,000 square feet of additional space, a roof replacement and upgrades to the seating bowl/field area. Using these figures, the renovations would be more than the $200 million public investment in the proposed deal for a new stadium. A study the following year, completed by the same company, lists maintenance and capital costs to keep the Dome at "today’s" levels between $79.5 million and $114.5 million. Those costs would include basic renovation items such as technology and plumbing upgrades, along with a new roof. Using these figures, the renovation cost would be less than the $200 million public investment into the proposed new stadium deal. The difference lies with which style of renovations is chosen: the exclusive Rolls-Royce level of renovations or the cheaper, base model Honda level of renovations. Reed’s statement is partially accurate but needs a lot of additional information and context. We rated the statement Half True. Staff writer Karishma Mehrotra contributed to this story.

pomt-10952	"The price of soybeans has fallen 50% since 5 years before the election. A big reason is bad (terrible) trade deals with other countries."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2018/jul/24/donald-trump/donald-trump-falsely-blames-trade-deals-lower-soyb/	Midwestern farmers are among those taking the brunt of President Donald Trump’s strategy to win trade concessions from China. After Trump hit China with about $34 billion in tariffs, China responded in equal measure. Among its targets – soybeans. Prices quickly fell by about 20 percent. Trump went to Twitter to argue that the fight is worth it. "Farmers have been on a downward trend for 15 years," he wrote July 20. "The price of soybeans has fallen 50% since 5 years before the Election. A big reason is bad (terrible) Trade Deals with other countries. They put on massive Tariffs and Barriers. Canada charges 275% on Dairy. Farmers will WIN!" See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com It’s clear that what is so far a mini-trade war has hurt prices. Have trade deals done the same? Trump focused on soybeans, so we took a look. Key takeaways Soybean prices have fallen since 2012, but the main driver has been weather. A drought that year cut production. Lower supply led to higher prices. Good weather followed, which boosted yields and pushed prices down. Trump tied falling prices to "terrible" trade deals, but that’s misleading. China is far and away the largest importer of American soybeans, buying about $12.3 billion worth last year, triple the amount in 2005. This has happened in the absence of a U.S.-China trade deal. The ups and downs of soybeans Trump looked back to "five years before the election." We asked the White House to clarify and didn’t hear back. 2012 was the highwater mark for soybean prices. They topped out at $17.70 a bushel in early September 2012. At the end of 2017, the price was $9.55. Corrected for inflation, prices dropped over 50 percent. Here’s how the futures market for soybeans has performed since 2000. See Figure 2 on PolitiFact.com Several forces drove soybean markets, but the leading one has been weather. A drought in 2012 pushed down yields, which in turn, drove up prices. Since then, the reverse happened. "In the past five years, we have had very good weather, " said Aaron Smith, agricultural economist at University of California-Davis. "Yields have been higher and that means prices go down." Between cooperative weather and new growing techniques, the yield per acre went up about 25 percent since 2012, Smith said. Smith noted that before 2012, soybean prices rose thanks to the ripple effects of the growing use of ethanol. Corn is a major raw material for ethanol, and with rising demand, farmers shifted more acres from soybeans to corn. That kept soybean production in check and with fewer bushels of soybeans than there would have been, prices headed up. But to understand soybeans sales, Smith said you need to look to Asia, and primarily China. "The demand from China has tripled in the past ten years or so," Smith said. The USDA statistics paint a clear picture. See Figure 3 on PolitiFact.com While the sales numbers bounce around a bit, China’s appetite for soybeans has been strong for the past 15 years. And that has been good for American farmers. Andrew Muhammad, a trade economist at the University of Tennessee Institute of Agriculture, said trade deals could not have been a factor here. "China is our number one soybean export market, and we have no trade deal with China," Muhammad said. In the 1990s, Congress granted China Most Favored Nation status. That boosted trade between the United States and China, but Most Favored Nation sets broad rules, in contrast to micro-level details that get hammered out in formal trade treaties, such as the one with Colombia, one of the most recent agreements. The United States does have a trade agreement with Mexico. Mexico is not as big of a buyer as China, but sales have gone up since 2000 and largely held steady since 2012. The North American Free Trade Agreement might present issues in other areas of trade, but soybeans isn’t one of them. Our ruling Trump said soybean prices have fallen since 2012 and a big factor was bad trade deals. Trump’s link between trade deals and falling prices is misplaced. Experts who know agriculture say it comes down to supply and demand. On the supply side, weather is the single most important factor, followed closely by more productive growing techniques. On the demands side, look to China. American farmers have benefited from current trade rules. Their largest buyer is China, where sales to China have tripled since 2005. The United States has no trade deal with China. It does have a trade deal with Mexico, where sales gradually increased and plateaued in recent years. Trump is correct that soybean prices have fallen, but his point about trade deals ignores the real drivers. We rate this claim Mostly False.

pomt-01305	"Scott Walker opposed a plan to help Wisconsin students refinance their student loans."	false	/wisconsin/statements/2014/oct/29/greater-wisconsin-political-fund/did-scott-walker-oppose-proposal-refinancing-stude/	Financial aid for college has gotten its share of attention around Wisconsin during 2014, and moreso in the days leading up to the Nov. 4, 2014 gubernatorial election. When U.S. Sen. Tammy Baldwin, D-Wis., said college students on average are graduating with $30,000 in student loan debt, we rated her claim Half True. Some reliable data indicated the figure is accurate, but other figures suggested it might be lower. And when U.S. Sen. Ron Johnson, R-Wis., claimed the affluent are taking advantage of student loans at the expense of middle-class families, our rating was Mostly False. He overstated the problem on both ends. In the governor’s race, Democratic challenger Mary Burke has said easing student loan debt is one of her priorities. Her claim that there are 41,000 people on a waitlist for financial aid for Wisconsin technical colleges and universities earned a Mostly True. The number wasn't totally firm, but pretty solid. Meanwhile, Republican Gov. Scott Walker has touted his tuition freeze at University of Wisconsin System schools rather than discussing college financial aid. But on Oct. 27, 2014, the liberal Greater Wisconsin Committee, which has run TV ads criticizing Walker, released another ad making this claim: "Scott Walker opposed a plan to help Wisconsin students refinance their student loans." Let’s see. Refinancing proposals It turns out the Greater Wisconsin Committee doesn’t have any proof that Walker opposed a state proposal to help students refinance student debt. Rather, the group contends that since Walker didn’t speak, or take action, in favor of the plan proposed by Democrats, he opposed it. Walker "has had every opportunity to show support for this legislative proposal. He specifically chose not to express support and has instead avoided the topic altogether," the group’s executive director, Rich Judge, told us in an email. Judge referred to legislation announced in October 2013 to create a state student loan refinancing authority. Legislative committee hearings were held on the proposal in February 2014. But no votes were ever taken by a committee or the full Legislature, so the issue never reached Walker’s desk. Judge also noted that Walker refused an April 2014 request from Democrats to hold a special session of the Legislature. But he noted that request was to take up not only the refinancing proposal but a number of other bills, as well. Finally, Judge cited a September 2014 news article in the Green Bay Press-Gazette about a Walker campaign appearance. Walker did not speak specifically about student loan debt during the stop, but did say he prefers controlling tuition over government-subsidized financial aid, the newspaper reported. Walker was quoted as saying: "We know it's not just about providing more financial assistance, it's about providing a great price for a UW education that's low to begin with." But none of the above shows opposition by the governor to the refinance proposal. We found another September 2014 news article, in the Racine Journal Times. That article reported that Walker said he would be willing to look at measures like the refinancing bill, but questioned whether the proposal is "more than just politics" because Democrats had not enacted it when they controlled the Legislature and the governor’s office prior to his election in 2010. "If it was a good idea, I’m sure they would have passed it four years ago when they controlled the Assembly and the Senate and the governorship," Walker was quoted as saying in response to questions from reporters. "They not only did not do it then, they presided over a state government that saw 5.5 percent average annual increases in tuition." Walker certainly isn’t declaring support for the refinancing authority, but he isn’t stating opposition, either. Our rating The Greater Wisconsin Committee says Walker "opposed a plan to help Wisconsin students refinance their student loans." The group acknowledged it has no evidence that Walker opposed a 2013 Democratic proposal to create a state student loan refinancing authority. Walker may not support the idea, but he hasn’t fought it, either -- as the group claimed. We rate the statement False.

pomt-10376	Barack Obama "extended health care for wounded troops who'd been neglected."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/jun/24/barack-obama/he-helped-but-wasnt-a-major-player/	In one of his first ads since winning the Democratic nomination for president, Sen. Barack Obama speaks directly to the camera about his life story and his legislative accomplishments. "America is a country of strong families and strong values," the ad begins. "My life's been blessed by both. I was raised by a single mom and my grandparents. We didn't have much money, but they taught me values straight from the Kansas heartland where they grew up." Later in the ad, Obama says, "I passed laws moving people from welfare to work, cut taxes for working families and extended health care for wounded troops who'd been neglected." For his statement that he "extended health care for wounded troops who'd been neglected," the campaign points to a couple of pieces of legislation. In 2008, Obama and Sen. Claire McCaskill contributed key portions to the National Defense Authorization Act that required postdeployment mental health screenings and a national study on the needs of Iraq veterans. We looked into the legislative history of the bill and found that Obama and McCaskill can at least take some credit for developing the list of requirements. It's not a major extension of benefits, however. Another problem for Obama is that he missed the final vote on the bill because he was campaigning. Republican nominee John McCain missed it, too. The bill passed overwhelmingly, 91-3. The other piece of legislation the campaign points to is an amendment Obama passed that picked up the tab for meals and phone calls for Iraq veterans receiving outpatient treatment. We looked at this legislation previously when Obama talked about it at a debate in Las Vegas in early 2008. Obama closed a loophole for outpatient veterans; hospitalized veterans were already covered. So in fairness, this was a tweak to previous legislation. If Obama had said he had helped extend health care for wounded veterans who'd been neglected, we would have given him a better rating. But he phrased his accomplishment to take more of the credit than that. Missing the vote on the 2008 bill does not help his case. For all of these reasons, we find his statement Half True.

pomt-04502	Says the United States has the "highest corporate tax rate in the world."	mostly true	/new-jersey/statements/2012/oct/04/joseph-kyrillos/joe-kyrillos-says-united-states-has-highest-corpor/	Republican U.S. Senate hopeful Joe Kyrillos said increased revenues are needed to deal with the national debt, but the path to that goal isn’t paved with tax hikes. Rather, Kyrillos said, he wants to lower taxes to stimulate growth. "Well, we're going to have to raise revenue and I want to do it through growth. I want to lower tax rates. I want to make sure that America doesn't have the highest corporate tax rate in the world, which is what we have now, and lower the rates for everybody," Kyrillos said during a debate tonight with his Democratic rival, U.S. Sen. Robert Menendez, that aired on NJTV. Are corporations in the United States subject to the highest tax rate in the world? The statutory rate for businesses is the highest among industrialized nations. But for the rate businesses actually pay -- what’s called the effective tax rate -- the United States ranks among the highest, but not at the very top, according to studies. We checked a nearly identical claim that Kyrillos made during an Aug. 20 interview on WOR-AM. Then he said, "we've got the highest corporate tax rate in the world." We rated that statement Mostly True. At that time, a spokeswoman for Kyrillos cited the nation’s top statutory corporate tax rate of 39.2 percent. That rate is a combination of federal, state and local tax rates before any tax breaks are factored in. Japan used to have a higher statutory rate than the United States. But in April, Japan reduced its rate and the U.S. took first place among industrialized nations, according to the Tax Foundation, a business-backed group. So on that point, Kyrillos is right. Since businesses receive a number of tax breaks, the effective tax rate for corporations in the U.S. isn’t the world’s highest, but it’s still up there. More than a dozen of the most recent studies on effective corporate tax rates across the world found businesses in the U.S. paid an effective rate between 23 percent and 34.9 percent, according to a September 2011 report from the Tax Foundation. The effective rate varied between the studies the Tax Foundation looked at because of different methodologies. In those studies, the U.S. never ranked first in the world. But in 10 of the studies, the nation’s effective corporate tax rate ranked among the top five highest. It’s worth noting that an analysis by the left-leaning Citizens for Tax Justice along with the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy, found that 30 Fortune 500 companies, including General Electric, didn’t pay any federal corporate income taxes over the 2008-2010 period. As for what is the better measure -- statutory rates or effective rates -- we found mixed views. Scott Hodge, the president of the Tax Foundation, told PolitiFact New Jersey in August that because statutory rates are fixed they make for better comparisons, whereas effective rates are unpredictable and vary across different industries. But Joseph Rosenberg, a research associate at the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center, said "effective tax rates provide the best measure of comparison for overall tax burdens." Then Aparna Mathur, an economist with the conservative American Enterprise Institute, said in an e-mail that "both are equally valid measures of looking at the burden of the corporate income tax." Our ruling Kyrillos repeated a claim he made before that the United States has the "highest corporate tax rate in the world." That’s true for the nation’s statutory corporate tax rate among industrialized nations. When Japan lowered its statutory rate, the United States moved into first place. Even when accounting for various tax breaks, the effective rate is still among the highest. On the Truth-O-Meter, we rate this statement Mostly True. To comment on this ruling, go to NJ.com.

pomt-00406	"Evidence is mounting that marijuana legalization reduces opioid addiction numbers."	mostly true	/new-york/statements/2018/aug/31/nathan-mcmurray/mcmurray-advocates-marijuana-legalization/	Nathan McMurray, a Democrat running in New York’s 27th Congressional District in Western New York, supports legalizing marijuana. He says doing so can help alleviate opioid addiction and financially benefit rural areas. "Evidence is mounting that marijuana legalization reduces opioid addiction numbers," it says on McMurray's campaign website. The Grand Island town supervisor has called for an end to the "failed war on drugs" by passing federal legislation that legalizes cannabis products. McMurray said he supports the Marijuana Justice Act bills (H.R. 4815 / S. 1689) that are currently in U.S. House and Senate committees. The proposed legislation would remove cannabis from the Federal Controlled Substances Act, and expunge federal marijuana use and possession crimes. McMurray says the legalization and taxation of cannabis in farming districts like NY-27 can benefit the local economy and generate tax revenues for the treatment of serious addictions. There is no way to know if lawmakers would use the tax revenue for opioid addiction treatment. But would legalizing marijuana reduce opioid addiction? Marijuana and opioid addiction Several studies have examined a possible link between marijuana legalization and opioid use. The outcomes were mixed. An October 2014 study in the Journal of the American Medical Association found that "states with medical cannabis laws had a 24.8 percent lower mean annual opioid overdose rate compared with states without medical cannabis laws." Medical marijuana laws reduced opioid overdose deaths over time, according to the study, which studied medical cannabis laws and opioid overdose mortality from 1999 to 2010 from all 50 states. In 2018, the same journal published a study of Medicare Part D patients, which found that in places where medical marijuana is legal, prescriptions for opioids decreased. "Medical cannabis laws are associated with significant reductions in opioid prescribing in the Medicare Part D population," researchers wrote. The National Institute on Drug Abuse, however, cautioned against reaching conclusions from the various published studies, some of which the institute funded. "Some studies have suggested that medical marijuana legalization might be associated with decreased prescription opioid use and overdose deaths, but researchers don't have enough evidence yet to confirm this finding," the institute states. The studies "are population-based and can’t show that medical marijuana legalization caused the decrease in deaths or that pain patients changed their drug-taking behavior." What's more, a study published in September 2017 in the American Journal of Psychiatry offered a contradictory finding. Researchers at the Department of Psychiatry at Columbia University Medical Center and the National Institute on Drug Abuse found that "cannabis use appears to increase rather than decrease the risk of developing nonmedical prescription opioid use and opioid use disorder." The researchers relied on data from the National Epidemiologic Survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions. More than 43,000 American adults were interviewed in 2001-2002 and follow-up interviews were done with 34,000 of them in 2004-2005. The researchers found that although most adults who used marijuana did not develop an opioid use disorder, using marijuana significantly increased the risk of developing an opioid use disorder, according to a Columbia University release. The National Institute on Drug Abuse acknowledges studies that show legally protected medical marijuana dispensaries, not just medical marijuana legalization, are associated with decreases in opioid prescribing, self-reports of opioid misuse, and treatment admissions for opioid addiction. The institute is continuing to study the relationship between legalized marijuana and opioid use, as well as marijuana’s possible use in treatment of opioid use disorder. Our ruling McMurray said "evidence is mounting" that marijuana legalization reduces opioid addiction. He did not call it a proven fact, which may have led to a different ruling. There is evidence that in places where marijuana is legal, there are fewer opioid deaths and fewer opioid prescriptions. It's important to keep in mind that the change in number of prescriptions cannot be presumed to be a change in how many people overdose. Besides, overdoses from prescribed opioids is only one part of the crisis. The National Institute on Drug Abuse has raised some red flags about drawing sweeping conclusions from the research and advises more studies are needed. McMurray's statement is accurate but needs additional information like what the institute provided, so we rate his statement Mostly True.

pomt-14515	The Arizona State Board of Education’s "failure to report teachers whose certifications have been revoked or suspended ... resulted in the death of a student."	mostly true	/arizona/statements/2016/feb/19/diane-douglas/arizonas-schools-chief-links-2009-murder-boards-fa/	State Superintendent of Public Instruction Diane Douglas recently lobbied against a bill that would allow the state Board of Education to hire and fire its employees, arguing that the board can’t handle the business it currently has. Douglas, who oversees K-12 education across the state, has a rocky history with the board, including trying to fire two board employees last February. Douglas mentioned an extreme example of board negligence to make her case against SB 1416 on Feb. 4 during a state Senate Education Committee meeting. "We presented a report to the board on (teacher discipline) that showed their abject failure to report teachers whose certifications have been revoked or suspended to the national database," she said. "And in one instance, because of that failure to report, it resulted in the death of a student." Her accusation was striking, so we wanted to fact-check whether the board failed to report a teacher’s history and if it resulted in a student’s death. The board erred Douglas was referring to former high school math teacher Tamara Hofmann. She taught at Marcos de Niza High School in Tempe. In November 2006, Chandler police found Hofmann and one of her students, Sixto Balbuena, together in her car. Both denied sexual relations when questioned by police. The incident immediately spurred an internal school investigation. Hofmann was removed from the classroom, but her provisional secondary teaching certificate remained valid until it expired on Jan. 5, 2007. Typically, a teacher needs to teach for three years on a provisional certificate before the state issues them a standard one. The process is usually automatic as the state Department of Education vets a teacher’s experience before issuing the certificate. However, only the state Board of Education can take action on a certificate, whether it's revoking or suspending an existing certificate, or denying a new certificate. The state board took no action on her provisional certificate. On Jan. 18, the school closed its investigation. She appealed the discipline — 10 days unpaid suspension and a letter of reprimand — before it was denied and imposed in February. The state board admitted that they recorded the investigation internally, but a clerical error did not show anyone outside the board that she was under investigation. If reported correctly, anyone could search for a teacher and whether or not they have any discipline using the state’s website. The state Department of Education, in turn, did not see that Hofmann was under investigation before they issued her a standard teaching certificate on Jan. 29, 2007. "There was nothing to flag it," Department of Education spokesman Charles Tack said. "That never got into the system." Hofmann returned to school in March 2007, working in the district’s office away from students. Hofmann continued to work in the district office until her contract ended in May. El Dorado High School in Chandler hired Hofmann the following summer. Like the department, they did not see past discipline for Hofmann visible on the state’s web site. It was there Hofmann met another student, Samuel Valdivia. In April 2009, Hofmann’s alleged lover, Sixto Balbuena, walked in on Hofmann with Valdivia at her apartment. Balbuena stabbed and killed Valdivia. It was only after the murder that Hofmann surrendered her certificate instead of going through a state board hearing. The board launched a complaint against the certificate in November 2009 and approved her surrender in January 2010. As for the "national database," Douglas was referring to the National Association of State Directors of Teacher Education and Certification. It is an oversight board for all state education departments. Reporting Hofmann's discipline at Marcos de Niza to the association would have provided another red flag to El Dorado before they hired her. Association CEO Phillip Rogers said a teacher with a valid certificate could still have discipline reported to the database. States decide on their own what to report to the database, he said. "In some states a reprimand where the educator retains his/her certificate might be reported, and in other states it would not," Rogers said. The one entry in the national database on Hofmann is from Jan. 27, 2010 — two days after she surrendered her teaching certificate. Our ruling Douglas said, "We presented a report to the board on (teacher discipline) that showed their abject failure to report teachers whose certifications have been revoked or suspended to the national database," she said. "And in one instance, because of that failure to report, it resulted in the death of a student." Let’s be clear: There is not a straight line between the actions of the Board of Education and the death of a student. But the actions -- or, really, lack of action -- by the Board of Education prevented a school district from seeing red flags that might have prevented Hofmann’s hiring. Without those flags, Hofmann was rehired. And that’s how a student ended up in a position that ultimately resulted in his death. Douglas’ claim is accurate but requires that fuller description of events. So we rate it Mostly True.	None	Diane Douglas	None	None	None	2016-02-19T12:00:00	2016-02-04	['None']
pomt-06715	"The ratio of corporate profits to wages is now higher than at any time since just before the Great Depression."	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/sep/01/robert-reich/robert-reich-says-ratio-corporate-profits-wages-hi/	In an Aug. 29, 2011, column, Robert Reich, the former Labor Secretary under President Bill Clinton and a frequent liberal commentator, offered a number of statistics to back up his call for worker protests rather than parades on Labor Day. "Labor Day is traditionally a time for picnics and parades," Reich’s column began. "But this year is no picnic for American workers, and a protest march would be more appropriate than a parade." One of the statistics Reich offered was this: "The ratio of corporate profits to wages is now higher than at any time since just before the Great Depression." A reader asked us to check this out, so we did. We turned to statistics compiled by the Bureau of Economic Analysis, the federal office that calculates official statistics about the economy. We found numbers for corporate profits as well as for two measures of worker income -- wage and salary disbursements, and total employee compensation received. We then divided corporate profits by both of the income measurements, all the way back to 1929. (Here are the full statistics from 1929 to 2011 as we calculated them.) For wages, we found that Reich was essentially correct. The ratio in 2010 -- the last full year in the statistics -- was .281, which was higher than any year back to at least 1929, the earliest year in the BEA database. The next highest ratio was in 2006, at .265. (We didn’t find pre-1929 data, so the one part of Reich’s statement that we can’t prove is that the ratio was higher "just before the Great Depression.") We also looked at total compensation, since the portion of worker compensation delivered outside of wages has grown significantly since 1929. The numbers were slightly different, but the general pattern still held. The ratio in 2010 was .226, which was matched or exceeded in only four years -- 1941, 1942, 1943 and 1950. To capture the most up-to-date trends, we also looked at the ratios for the last six quarters. For both wages and compensation, the ratio has risen steadily over that year-and-a-half period. For wages, the ratio has climbed from .274 in the first quarter of 2010 to .290 in the second quarter of 2011. For compensation, the ratio has risen from .220 in the first quarter of 2010 to .234 in the second quarter of 2011. So numerically, there’s little question that Reich is essentially right. (Or, at least for now he is. Economists note that statistics about corporate profits and wages are often revised after the fact.) A more interesting question is what this trendline actually means. First, we’ll note that the ratio has been remarkably steady over the time we studied. In 2010, corporate income was 168 times what it was in 1929, and wages were 124 times what they were in 1929. But despite the dramatic increases for both measures individually, these two numbers have grown pretty much in tandem. While corporate profits have grown faster, they haven’t grown dramatically faster. Over the eight-decade period, the ratio between corporate profits and wages -- at least prior to 2010 -- almost always hovered between .150 and .235, a pretty narrow range, all things considered. Within this range, the ratio has regularly zigzagged up and down. The ratio has peaked during World War II, the early 1950s, the mid1960s, the mid1990s and the middle of the first decade of the 21st century. The 2010 high broke with this history, making the statistic Reich is talking about all the more striking. And as the quarterly data shows, the spike from 2010 has continued into 2011. This spike has its roots in basic mathematics. The ratio can rise for either of two reasons -- because corporate profits rise, or because wages stagnate. To a greater degree than in past recessions, both of these developments have happened simultaneously in 2010 and 2011. That’s the immediate reason for the ratio’s sudden increase. The ratio was well within historical norms as recently as 2009, the second year of the recession. Today, "indicators favorable to workers are either absolutely dreadful, like the percentage of the adult population that is employed, or else improving at a not-very-robust rate, like real compensation per hour, while indicators favorable to business owners, such as record profit levels measured in billions of current dollars, are very delightful indeed," said Gary Burtless, an economist at the centrist-to-liberal Brookings Institution. There are any number of explanations for why businesses are so reluctant to invest their profits today. For instance, Dan Mitchell, an economist at the libertarian Cato Institute, said the pattern of low corporate investment that we’re seeing today has to do with "a climate of economic uncertainty, largely thanks to the threat of more taxes and regulations." But the explanation that seems to mesh best with our numbers has to do with economic cycles. While the ratio Reich points to is exaggerated today due to an unusually deep recession and an especially sluggish recovery, the general pattern follows that of other recent recessions, said J.D. Foster, an economist with the conservative Heritage Foundation. Typically, businesses initially lose ground during a recession, while workers suffer somewhat less, in part due to "sticky wages" -- the tendency for worker pay to increase or stagnate rather than fall, even in hard times. This pattern tends to decrease the ratio of corporate profits to wages. However, when the recovery begins, the reverse becomes true -- businesses tend to gain ground faster than workers do, since soft labor markets prevent workers from reaping the rewards of improved productivity. This pushes the ratio of profits to wages higher. Since the current recovery is particularly weak, the increase in the ratio has been even stronger than normal. The hopeful news for workers, Foster says, is that once a recovery gathers steam and new capital-labor equilibrium is reached, workers tend to accelerate their gains. "Once a strong recovery is under way and labor markets return to normal, total labor compensation tends to catch up, as employers bid for employees out of the extra profit margin they accumulated during the recovery," Foster said. "So once we start heading toward full employment, we can expect total labor compensation to rise very rapidly relative to total income." So where does this leave us? On the numbers, Reich’s claim is essentially correct. And in his analysis, Reich doesn’t over-promise on what the data indicate. Amid evidence that these numbers could turn out to be a temporary spike, he resists the temptation to label it the culmination of a long-term trend. We find Reich’s formulation both factually supportable and appropriately cautious in its interpretation. We give it a rating of True.

pomt-07665	Tampa mayoral opponent Bob Buckhorn "supported forcing police officers to keep their guns locked in the trunks of their cruisers."	false	/florida/statements/2011/mar/10/rose-ferlita/rose-ferlita-says-bob-buckhorn-wanted-police-lock/	In a new television advertisement airing March 10, 2011, Tampa mayoral candidate Rose Ferlita's campaign claims Bob Buckhorn jeopardized police officers' lives by supporting a requirement that they keep their guns locked in the trunks of their cruisers. This claim has come up in two previous political campaigns in Tampa, though this is the first time it has been attached to Buckhorn. Police and officials involved in the decision have twice said it is false. Asked for the source of the statement, Ferlita campaign consultant Anthony Pedicini e-mailed PolitiFact Florida excerpts from several St. Petersburg Times and Tampa Tribune newspaper articles. They included a 1990 profile of Buckhorn that described his close relationship with then-Mayor Sandy Freedman, for whom he worked as a special assistant, and a 1996 article that quoted Freedman saying a political opponent’s claim about the guns-in-the-trunk issue was false. None of the news accounts mention Buckhorn in connection with the issue. The first time the guns-in-the-trunk issue came up was February 1995, when Dick Greco raised it during his successful campaign to return to the mayor's office. Greco said at the time that police didn't like having to keep their shotguns locked in their trunks, but want them within easy reach in the passenger compartment. The shotguns-in-the-trunk policy dated to the early 1990s, when Freedman was mayor. But city officials have said it was not the mayor's work. A safety committee made up of Tampa police officers and police management recommended that officers store shotguns in the trunks of their cruisers, then-city public safety administrator Bob Smith told the St. Petersburg Times in 1995. "The placement of a shotgun in a police car has never been a political issue, and I don't think it should be," Smith said in the Feb. 11, 1995 article. "The placement is based on safety and efficiency for the officer." Police cruisers had gotten smaller with each new model the city bought, and 1990s-era computers and bulky radio equipment were taking up much of the passenger area. The shotguns also couldn't obstruct either the driver- or passenger-side airbags, and officers didn't want them behind their heads, Smith said. That left little room but the trunk, Smith said. The policy concerned only shotguns. Police still carried 9mm semiautomatic handguns. In 1996, the issue came up again when Freedman and then-state Rep. Jim Davis faced off in a Democratic primary for a seat in Congress. In a campaign mailing, Davis said putting the shotguns in the trunks of cruisers had endangered the lives of officers. Freedman was not named in the mailer, but a Davis aide confirmed at the time that the flier targeted her. Then-Tampa police spokesman Steve Cole said in August 1996 that Davis incorrectly repeated a false rumor that blamed Freedman for making Tampa officers keep shotguns in their trunks. "The mayor has nothing to do with the shotguns," Cole told the Times in the Aug. 29, 1996, article. "There have always been rumors that Mayor Freedman ordered the shotguns in the trunk. . . . As far as (then) Chief (Bennie) Holder knows, that was never an order that was given. It was a rumor." Far from taking tools away from police, Cole said in 1996, it was Freedman who authorized the purchase of bulletproof vests and 9mm Glocks at the request of police officials, who said they were under-equipped with their .38-caliber revolvers. Freedman said at the time she didn't even know about the shotgun-in-the-trunk policy until Greco raised it. She said on March 10 that neither she nor Buckhorn had anything to do with it. "That’s an urban legend about the shotguns," said Freedman, who supports Buckhorn's bid for mayor. "What happened is, we went to a different kind of car and they didn’t fit." Still, Freedman did make some decisions that upset officers. In 1988, she rescinded the policy that allowed officers to drive their cruisers home to save the city on expenses such as gas and insurance. In 1996, Greco made good on a campaign promise and reinstated the take-home cars. Taking away officers' take-home cars -- like the shotguns in the trunk -- was an instance when Buckhorn took "tools away from police" while he was an aide to Freedman, Pedicini, Ferlita's campaign consultant, said on March 10. "Those were all policies that he and Sandy worked on together." Pulling the plug on the take-home car program left officers frustrated, angry and bitter. But Freedman said the city faced a multimillion-dollar budget shortfall, and discontinuing the take-home car program saved money that she put into police raises and adding officers. And she said Buckhorn had nothing to do with her decision on the take-home cars. "Was Bob the police chief and I missed it?" she said. "Bob was opposed to me taking the cars, but he wasn’t one of the principals making the decision." Ferlita’s ad says "Buckhorn supported forcing police officers to keep their guns locked in the trunks of their cruisers." Buckhorn worked for Freedman, yes, but the record shows that the shotgun-in-the-trunk policy came from police themselves, not from the mayor's office. Also, the policy in question concerned shotguns, not all guns. And officials have twice refuted this claim. As a result, we rate this statement False.

pomt-08767	The United States is "50th in life expectancy" in the world.	mostly true	/florida/statements/2010/aug/25/alan-grayson/rep-alan-grayson-says-us-50th-life-expectancy/	Instead of talking about whether President Barack Obama is a Muslim, lawmakers -- especially Republicans -- should do more to address challenges like unemployment and lagging performance in United States schools, U.S. Rep. Alan Grayson, D-Orlando, told Cenk Uygur, guest host for the MSNBC's The Ed Show, on Aug. 18, 2010. "It‘s sad. Look, we really are cheating ourselves. This can be a heaven on Earth. This could be an outstanding place to live, the very top in the entire world. Instead, we‘re 50th in the world -- 50th in life expectancy, just below Albania. We are dead last in math test scores. And believe me, the math is the same in Seoul, Korea, as it is in here. It‘s the same math," Grayson said. Is the U.S. really that low on the life expectancy scale? We decided to find out. Todd Jurkowski, Grayson's press secretary, directed us to the 2009 life expectancy estimates in the CIA World Factbook. The United States is, indeed, No. 50. But the CIA has since updated those estimates. In 2010, Macau had the highest life expectancy at birth -- 84.36 years. The United States comes in at No. 49, with an average life expectancy of 78.11 years. Still, that's only slightly off from the figure that Grayson cited. But we quickly found that other sources paint a different picture. The World Health Organization maintains its own life expectancy data. In 2008, the latest year for which the numbers are available, people in the U.S. had an average life expectancy of 78 years. That put us in a tie with the United Arab Emirates, Kuwait, Costa Rica, and Chile. The figures are all rounded to the nearest whole number, which means that numerous countries were tied. There are 30 countries that had higher life expectancy than the United States. Then there is the U.S. Census Bureau Statistical Abstract. In 2010, the United States came in at No. 50 with an average life expectancy of 78.2 years. Macau, a Special Administrative Region (SAR) of the People's Republic of China (PRC), came in first, with 84.4 years. The United Nations Statistical Division provides a gender breakdown of life expectancy at birth. For men, Iceland came at the top, with 81 years. The United States was No. 18 (78 years). Again, due to whole-number rounding, the U.S. tied with the Netherlands, Malta, Austria, Ireland, Cyprus, the United Kingdom, Germany, Luxembourg, Greece and Belgium. For women, Japan dominates -- the average life expectancy is 87 years. The U.S. came in 34th (82 years). Finally, 2010 data from the Population Reference Bureau, a nonprofit research institute in Washington D.C., put the United States at No. 41. We're tied with Reunion (an island in the Indian Ocean), French Guiana, Cuba, and Kuwait. And that brings us to an important caveat with virtually all of the rankings. While it is technically true that the United States ranked 49th in the latest CIA World Factbook, consider some of the countries that had a higher ranking. Macau, for example ranked first, but it's less than one-sixth the size of Washington, D.C. San Marino, a state nestled inside Italy, came in at No. 11, but it has a population of only slightly more than 30,000 people. You get the picture -- some of the "countries" that ranked higher than the United States are, well, countries in name only. To a get a better picture of where we stand, we wanted to see how the United States compares with its peers (that is, generally large, industrialized democracies). We consulted statistics from the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. The latest year for which data are available for all 31 countries is 2007. Japan ranked first, with average life expectancy of 82.6 years. The United States came in at No. 25, with 77.9 years. So among large industrialized democracies, the U.S. is on the lower end of the spectrum. Grayson claimed that the United States ranks 50th in the world for life expectancy. We found a few sources that show that we're actually a bit higher. The Population Reference Bureau put us at No. 41, while data from the World Health Organization indicate that we may be in the low 30's. Still, we think that Grayson's underlying point that the U.S. isn't as high in life expectancy as one would think is valid, so we rate this Mostly True.

pomt-03521	"A bag of Cheetos costs less to buy than an apple," and in some Milwaukee neighborhoods "good luck trying to find an apple or a banana or some sort of healthy option"	mostly true	/wisconsin/statements/2013/jun/02/mike-tate/mike-tate-says-cheetos-cost-less-apple-some-milwau/	On a recent radio talk show, Wisconsin Democratic Party chairman Mike Tate gently criticized a widely discussed Republican bill mandating that food stamp recipients buy mostly healthy foods from a state-approved list. In doing so, Tate framed the debate around a certain orange-colored, cheese-flavored snack and a fruit grown in every state in the continental U.S. Tate spoke after one-third of Democrats in the state Assembly joined Republicans in approving the bill, which aims to cut down on junk food purchases seen as contributing to poor health in low-income families participating in the state’s FoodShare program. "I’ll be honest with you, I think that having nutritional standards is an important thing," Tate told liberal radio talker John "Sly" Sylvester of Monroe’s WEKZ-FM on May 14, 2013. "I think there is a need for government to play a role in the marketplace and having healthy, nutritious food be available for people on FoodShare that can’t have access to it. " Tate defended those who voted for the bill as well-intentioned in trying to ease an obesity problem that is worse in Milwaukee and other urban areas, but said the legislation may not have been the best mechanism to do it. Tate also unpacked some specific claims about urban areas, specifically Milwaukee. "You know, I think that it’s a problem that a bag of Cheetos costs less to buy than an apple," he said. "You go around some neighborhoods in Milwaukee and, good luck trying to find an apple or a banana or some sort of healthy option." Milwaukee Common Council President Willie Hines Jr. made a similar statement in a recent opinion piece in the Journal Sentinel, saying that "it’s generally a lot easier to reach for the less expensive Cheetos, doughnuts and Suzy Q’s than the more pricey veggie chips, granola bars and almonds." Is Tate right? To check out the two parts of Tate’s claim, we reached out to local food experts, but also fueled up a car to test the food market in some of Milwaukee’s poorest north-side neighborhoods. In all we made purchases at 11 stores, ranging from full-line groceries to corner convenience stores and gas-station marts, mostly in Milwaukee but a few in neighboring suburban communities. The first thing that jumped out at us: At 2-for-$1, a single serving bag of Cheetos Crunchy (170 calories, 18 percent of recommended daily fat allowance) is hard to beat on price for a snack. In fact, many stores offer a whole range of chips at 50 cents a bag. By comparison, when we sought out single apples at the lowest per-pound or individual price available, we paid less than half a buck only once. At the top end, we paid $1.21 and $1.20 for an apple at two full-size markets and 65 cents and 99 cents at two convenience stores. Still, we were able to beat or match the Cheetos price, finding apples for 37 cents at a major Milwaukee supermarket, and for 50 cents at two city convenience stores as well as a supermarket in bordering Wauwatosa. Not every store had apples and not every store had single apples. That was just for snack-sized purchases. Bulk packaging, of course, drops the cost. We found 5-packs of gala apples (estimated 79 calories each, 0 from fat) at a small grocery in Milwaukee for the equivalent of 40 cents a piece, give or take a penny. And a chain supermarket near the edge of the city, in Shorewood, had bags of apples that averaged about 45 cents a piece. A chain store had them for 38 cents apiece in bulk. But Cheetos can drop even lower, to as little as 24 cents cents a bag, in 50-bag packs in combination with other snack chips, we found at one supermarket in Milwaukee. It was clear from our limited check that Cheetos are often cheaper than apples -- though not always. Prices, of course, can vary widely depending on quantity, timing, sales and other factors. And individual appetites can skew comparisons -- a 3.75-ounce bag of Cheetos Crunchy Flamin’ Hot is advertised as four servings but we’re guessing it doesn’t always go down that way. That bag will set you back $1.49 -- or about 37 cents a serving if you can stop after 21 pieces. Seeking fruit We sought out expert opinion on the larger issue Tate raised -- on the availability of healthy food options. Sherrie Tussler, executive director of the Hunger Task Force in Milwaukee, told us that many FoodShare recipients rely at least in part on convenience stores because they lack transportation to reach supermarkets that can offer fresher and sometimes less expensive products. Hunger Task Force, which opposes the state legislation as too expensive and complicated, closely tracks food availability in the city and plans to create a corner market emphasizing healthy foods. Residents in Milwaukee’s lowest socioeconomic-status group have more than twice the saturation of small food outlets as in higher-status neighborhoods, the Milwaukee Health Report 2012 study found. The annual report, by the Center for Urban Population Health, examines health disparities by socioeconomic status. "There is strong evidence that access to supermarkets rather than smaller grocery/convenience stores correlates with lower prevalence of overweight, obesity, and hypertension," the study said. The report said obesity rates in Milwaukee -- which easily top the Wisconsin average -- are highest in lower-economic status populations. The Health Report study found that inadequate consumption of fruits and vegetables is prevalent across all economic groups, but somewhat better at higher levels. "A lot of it is because you can afford it and you can find it," said Geoffrey Swain, medical director for the Milwaukee Health Department and a co-author of the Health Report study. A close observer of convenience stores in town commented recently that corner convenience stores are the main food source for Milwaukee’s poor. "Some stores do have fruits and vegetables, but are likely to be more expensive and of poorer quality, mainly because our nation’s produce distribution system is not geared to service the small mom-and-pop corner stores," Young Kim, executive director of the organization behind the north-side’s Fondy Farmers Market, wrote in May 14 column for Urban Milwaukee. Tate points to Kim’s piece as part of his argument on the difficulty in getting access to fresh fruit. Kim told us that fruit "just isn’t nearly as readily available" as some of the snack foods. "Cheetos and a lot of those snack foods get delivered" to small stores, in contrast to fruit, which small-store owners have to buy from larger stores and then mark up, he noted. Kim opposes the state legislation for singling out low-income people. In our spot check at five small stores, we, too, found that you can get some limited amounts of fruit at some corner stores -- as well as, of course, a full selection at the few larger food markets on Milwaukee’s north side. And we found that fruit quality was very mixed at the small stores, ranging from excellent to very poor. We learned that programs run by the Fondy Food Center and the Walnut Way Conservation Corp., among others, are working to try to put more fresh goods into local stores and educate people on healthy choices. The city of Milwaukee Health Department, through grant funding from the Healthier Wisconsin Partnership Program of the Medical College of Wisconsin, has provided funds for produce coolers in several convenience stores in the Lindsay Heights neighborhood on Milwaukee’s north side. At one store, Eagle Foods at N. 14th and W. Centers streets, we found fruit in a large and prominent display near a cooler stocked with take-out servings of cut fruit and vegetables, as well as mangoes and tomatoes. At the Families First store, 1845 N. 12th St., candy bars are behind a caged cashier, and a small stock of large Golden Delicious apples are front and center. There were a few tomatoes in the cooler, but overall the produce stock was very limited. Nobody’s suggesting that better access is a panacea for changing people’s dietary decisions. Consumer education is another key, Hines and other say. But experts told us that providing more choices is a necessary first step toward improvement. But there’s a steep hill to climb in terms of making good quality produce widely available. A 2008 study by the Neighborhood Health Alliance in Lindsay Heights, for example, found that more than 65% of the neighborhood retail food outlets offered no fresh produce. "Residents indicated that key concerns were: poor food quality, poor access to quality fresh produce and healthy food options, and a lack of transportation," the study found. "I don’t want to call it a ‘food desert,’" Eric Gass, the Health Department’s public health research and policy director, said of Lindsay Heights. "Food is available. It’s just not good food. There’s a term I’ve heard for that: a ‘food swamp.’" Residents in the Amani neighborhood, near Lindsay Heights, who lack vehicles or can’t get a ride have to figure out how to cover a mile and a half or more to find a full-service store on the city’s north side, Tussler said. Buses are an option. "Think bus fare," Tussler said in an email to us. "Then how much can you carry? Then think once a month you pay for a taxi. You buy case goods because they don't spoil. You freeze meat and buy Wonder Bread because it doesn't mold. Then you get milk at the corner store." While access to good quality, healthier foods has improved only marginally on the north side in recent years, Tussler said, "the south side has been a big winner." She noted the expansion by local El Rey markets and the addition of large stores such as the Pick ‘N Save at S. 19th St. and W. National Ave. Overall, on this part of Tate’s claim, we heard -- and saw for ourselves -- that fruit is for sale on the north side, but not necessarily in the kind of quantities that make it as affordable or as fresh as in some other neighborhoods. And getting to the store that has what a family needs can be a challenge for some. The legislation, meanwhile, was pending in the state Senate as of late May 2013. The city of Milwaukee took no position on the bill. Our rating Tate, the Democratic Party official, decried the lack of healthy and affordable food options in some Milwaukee neighborhoods. "A bag of Cheetos costs less to buy than an apple," Tate said, and "good luck trying to find an apple or a banana or some sort of healthy option" at stores there. He’s mostly right on the price comparison, and is partially accurate in suggesting it’s very difficult to locate fresh fruit. While fresh fruit can be found at big and some small stores, it’s more available in some low-income areas more than others, and getting there, finding it worth eating and paying for it are a challenge for some, according to experts and residents. We rate his claim Mostly True.	None	Mike Tate	None	None	None	2013-06-02T20:36:55	2013-05-14	['Milwaukee']
pomt-14799	"Twenty-five percent of our kids in foster care are there because their parents are involved in drugs."	true	/missouri/statements/2015/nov/30/vicky-hartzler/hartzler-was-modest-connection-between-drugs-and-f/	U.S. Congresswoman Vicky Hartzler, R-Missouri , visited ABC 17’s "This Week" on Oct. 9, and was asked about "Take Back The District," an anti-drug initiative she was launching. Hartzler said drugs posed a significant problem in her district. Employers, she said, tell her they cannot find an employee to fill a position because applicants can’t pass a drug test, while military recruiters say they have to turn away otherwise exceptional recruits because of drug use. Hartzler talked about her years teaching at-risk teenagers and cited a widespread drug problem in the United States and one of its most sobering effects: the displacement of children into foster care. "Twenty-five percent of our kids in foster care are there because their parents are involved in drugs," Hartzler said. Certainly drug use by parents can lead to state intervention, but is the number of reported cases really this high? Foster care According to the Congressional Coalition on Adoption Institute, there are 397,122 children living in the foster system without permanent families. Hartzler has long been an advocate for the advancement of foster care, even co-publishing an article on its problems. Kyle Buckles, Hartzler’s communications director, pointed us toward the Green Book. Each year, statistics are compiled into the House of Representative’s Green Book, which is used to provide background material and data on the programs run by the Ways and Means Committee, including foster care. Foster care statistics Circumstance of Removal FY2010 FY2011 FY2012 FY2013 Drug abuse (parent) 26.1 26.2 28.5 28.1 Alcohol abuse (parent) 7.6 6.3 6.3 5.6 Without considering alcohol, drug use by the parent was above 25 percent from 2010 through 2013, for which data is available. When alcohol is factored in, this number is more than 30 percent. Drug use is the second largest cause of the removal of children from their parent’s custody. The most prevalent circumstance for removal is neglect, which is present in over half of the cases in the United States — but it is important to remember that more than one factor may be cited in a particular case. For example, a child may be removed from his parents’ custody for neglect, parental drug abuse and child drug abuse. The problem appears to be getting worse. A 2009 study by the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration found that between the years 2002 and 2007, 12 percent of children between the ages of six to 11 were living with a parent who abused drugs or alcohol. Take Back the District Hartzler’s initiative has since met once to discuss the district’s drug issues. Her goal was to bring together law enforcement, parents, school officials, community leaders and citizens. The program met early on Oct. 19, where Hartzler, speakers and guests discussed the issuesand possible solutions to the problem and then diverted to a "Faith-Based Rehabilitation and Ministry" panel discussion. Our ruling Hartzler claimed that a quarter of children in foster care were there because of their parent’s drug abuse. Her claim is a modest estimation of the issue, according to reliable data kept by Congress. Drug abuse by parents is the second most prevalent reason for a parent losing custody of a child to foster care services. We rate this claim to be True.

But did the United States "invite" Russia to pursue this sudden escalation? That’s what New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie said during the Republican presidential debate in Las Vegas. "I'll tell you what reckless is," Christie said during the debate on Dec. 15, 2015. "What’s reckless is is calling Assad a reformer. What reckless is allowing Russia to come into Crimea and Ukraine. What reckless is is inviting Russia into Syria to team with Iran. That is reckless. And the reckless people are the folks in the White House right now. Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton are the reckless people." This statement includes a lot of charges by Christie. But for this fact-check, we’ll zero in on Christie’s claim that the Obama administration invited Russia into Syria. Russia’s airstrikes The situation in Syria is complex, but we’ll start by trying to offer a concise summary. Syrian rebels -- some considered moderates, some considered extremists -- have been trying for several years to topple Bashar Assad whose family has run the country in authoritarian fashion for decades. The chaos has contributed to the rise of ISIS, which has effectively seized control of portions of Syria, including Raqqa, the city ISIS is using as its "capital." Most of the world has no love for the Assad government, but Syria has long relied on two countries for support -- Iran and Russia. Russia’s ties to Syria include a leased naval base, which is Russia’s only Mediterranean port and thus a crucial geopolitical asset. Russia has generally supported Assad, but until recently, Russia’s military role in Syria had been fairly low-profile. By contrast, since the ISIS threat became clear, the United States -- along with a coalition of more than 60 countries -- has been taking an active military role in Syria. For the United States and a few other allies, that has meant launching airstrikes against ISIS targets. The longstanding U.S. position regarding Russia and Syria has been to convince Russia to forgo its support for Assad. For instance, in a Sept. 11, 2015, town hall at Ft. Meade in Maryland -- about two and a half weeks before Russian airstrikes began -- Obama took note of Russia’s efforts to send military advisers and equipment to Syria. "That won't change our core strategy, which is to continue to put pressure on ISIL in Iraq and Syria, but we are going to be engaging Russia to let them know that you can't continue to double-down on a strategy that’s doomed to failure," Obama said. "And if they are willing to work with us and the 60-nation coalition that we've put together, then there’s the possibility of a political settlement in which Assad would be transitioned out and a new coalition of moderate, secular and inclusive forces could come together and restore order in the country." White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest echoed that in a press briefing on Sept. 24, less than a week before Russia began its airstrikes. Earnest was asked by a reporter, "Where do we stand in terms of possible U.S.-Russian military cooperation on Syria?" Earnest responded, "President Obama will make clear once again that Russia doubling down on their support for the Assad regime is a losing bet. The likely consequence of them doing so is only to deepen and expand the ongoing crisis in that country that doesn’t serve the interests of either the Russian people or the American people. President Obama will encourage President Putin to consider constructive contributions to the ongoing counter-(ISIS) effort. There are more than 60 nations that are involved in implementing a strategy to degrade and ultimately destroy ISIL, and we’d like to see the Russians make a constructive contribution to that ongoing effort." If you squint, it’s possible to see an "invitation" for Russian military intervention in Earnest’s comment. However, the administration has couched this "invitation" in diplomatic terms, focusing on a broad effort to promote a peaceful end to the crisis rather than a desire for Russia to start bombing away. Moreover, the immediate aftermath of the first airstrikes suggests that the administration was not happy -- at all -- to learn about the escalation to airstrikes ordered by Russian President Vladimir Putin. Shortly after the airstrikes became public, Defense Secretary Ashton Carter called Russia’s move tantamount "to pouring gasoline on the fire." The same day, Deputy Defense Secretary Robert Work told members of the House Armed Services Committee that the United States was "alarmed" by the beginning of Russian airstrikes. He called it "an aggressive action by Russia." Immediately after the Russian airstrikes began, Earnest said the United States was continuing to encourage "constructive" moves by Russia but expressed skepticism about its recent military actions. "If Russia is willing, we would welcome their constructive contribution to this effort," Earnest said in his Sept. 30 briefing. "The fact that they have not decided to make a constructive contribution to our counter-(ISIS) effort means that Russia is not doing exactly what we would like them to do in Syria, and that’s not unusual in the relationship between our two countries. … Obviously, we would like to see Russia do something different. I’m not trying to suggest to you that this is what we would like to see Russia do." What the experts say When we checked with diplomatic and regional experts, they generally agreed with the White House that Christie’s words -- if taken literally -- were inaccurate. "Russia decided to intervene in Syria on its own. There was no U.S. invitation," said Barnett R. Rubin, director and senior fellow at New York University’s Center on International Cooperation. "No, Obama did not invite Russia into Syria. Just wrong," said Bruce Riedel, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution. Joshua Landis, director of the Center for Middle East Studies at the University of Oklahoma, agreed. "It isn't true," Landis said. "The United states tried to oppose Russia moving aircraft and weaponry into Syria. The U.S. government convinced Greece and other countries to close its airspace to Russian planes. Russia flew over Iran and Iraq, which allowed the Russian resupply planes to overfly them. The U.S. could have attacked the Russian planes and ships and did not. I presume Chris Christie is confusing that with an invitation." The Christie campaign doesn’t contest the idea that Christie’s claim isn’t literally true. Instead, the campaign argues that the administration’s fault was one of omission rather than commission. "The governor was suggesting that the president's actions or lack thereof invited Putin to fill the vacuum left by a lack of leadership, not that he sent a written invitation," said Mike DuHaime, a senior strategist with the Christie campaign. At least one expert said DuHaime’s argument has some validity. "I don’t think Christie meant it to be taken literally," said Daveed Gartenstein-Ross, a senior fellow at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies. "Obviously we did not invite Russia in. But what I think he’s very clearly referring to is a weakness that led to Russia coming in. The fact that the administration has had an awful Syria policy has moved beyond a matter of opinion." The Christie campaign also pointed us to a comment Christie made to CNN’s Jake Tapper on Oct. 8 in which he explains that by the "invitation" he means the cooperation between the United States and Russia on removing chemical weapons from Syria in 2013. Obama "invited Putin in to broker an agreement with Assad to give up his chemical weapons, which Assad has not done," Christie told Tapper. "Once you invite Putin in for that part of it, you can't then pick and choose given the Obama approach what you do. So he did invite him in, Jake. And it was wrong." Our ruling Christie said the Obama administration "invit(ed) Russia into Syria." We found wide agreement that the statement, if taken literally, is inaccurate. However, another interpretation -- that the Obama administration’s policy failures created a vacuum that Putin filled militarily -- has some validity, experts say. We rate the statement Mostly False. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/57ffb42c-34aa-4359-b2ca-90dd626043f3	None	Chris Christie	None	None	None	2015-12-21T15:23:57	2015-12-15	['Russia', 'Syria', 'Barack_Obama']
pomt-14368	The Trump Winery near Charlottesville, Va. is the "largest winery on the East Coast."	false	/virginia/statements/2016/mar/21/donald-trump/donald-trump-says-virginia-winery-largest-east-coa/	Donald Trump is no stranger to superlatives. During a news conference after his victories in the Michigan and Mississippi primaries in early March, the billionaire presidential candidate burnished his business credentials by pointing to an array of products that bear his name, including bottles of Virginia-made wine from Trump Winery, just south of Charlottesville. "It’s the largest winery on the East Coast," Trump said. The Republican frontrunner added that he owns the winery "100 percent." Trump did purchase the 1,300-acre vineyard in 2011 where the winery is based and turned over the management to his son, Eric. A legal disclaimer on the winery website says the GOP presidential candidate doesn’t own the winery. The venture is a limited liability corporation, and its owners are not a matter of public record. That point aside, let’s move to the focus of this Truth-O-Meter: Is the winery really the largest on the East Coast, as Trump claimed? We emailed his campaign three times seeking backup for the statement but didn’t hear back. So we began our own investigation. First, we contacted the Virginia Wine Board, a panel created by the Virginia General Assembly to promote state wineries and vineyards. Annette Boyd, the board’s director, said Trump Winery has planted 200 acres of vines. By that measure, called "acres under vine," Boyd said Trump Winery has the largest vineyard in Virginia. The Trump Winery website, citing the same 200-acre figure, also says it’s the largest vineyard in the state. It additionally claims that it’s the largest "vinifera vineyard" on the East Coast, referring to a species of grape. But the website never goes as far as Donald Trump did in making an unconditional claim that the winery is the largest on the East Coast. He’s made that statement a number of times. Several wine industry analysts told us that when calculating a winery’s size, the best measure is not the acreage of vines that have been planted - it’s the volume of wine produced. By that standard, wine experts told us there’s no way Trump Winery is the biggest on the East Coast. "That’s not correct," Michael Kaiser, spokesman for the National Association of American Wineries, told us about Trump’s claim. In fact, by that measure Trump Winery is not even the largest in Virginia. The Trump Winery produces about 36,000 cases of wine each year, according to Boyd. The top producers in the state are the Williamsburg Winery and Chateau Morrisette in Floyd County -- each making about 60,000 cases a year, Boyd said. Barboursville Winery in Orange County, meanwhile, makes about 37,000 cases a year, Boyd said. It’s not hard to find wineries along the East Coast that make even more. Duplin Winery in Rose Hill, N.C., produces about 390,000 cases of sweet wine a year, Dave Fussell Jr., Duplin’s president, told us in an email. Duplin, on its website, claims to be the "largest winery in the South." Its grapes come from more than 1,000 acres, the vast majority from farmers who grow them off-site. The Biltmore Winery in Asheville, N.C., says on its website that it produces about 150,000 cases of wine a year. Lastly, we wondered whether there are wineries on the East Coast that have more grapes than Trump Winery’s 200 acres of vines. The answer is yes. The Wagner Vineyards Estate Winery in the Finger Lakes region of New York says it cultivates 250 acres of grapes (and makes 50,000 cases of wine a year). The vineyard manager at Pindar Vineyards on New York’s Long Island said in a November 2015 interview that its vineyard has more than 300 acres of grapes. Pindar says it makes 70,000 cases of wine a year. Our ruling Trump said that Trump Winery is the "largest winery on the East Coast." It’s not, regardless of whether you measure it by acreage of vines or the production of wine. We rate Trump’s statement False.

pomt-11207	Says Dean Heller "has voted for a GOP bill that funded efforts to revive Yucca Mountain."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2018/may/14/jacky-rosen/rosen-misleads-heller-yucca-mountain-vote/	Yucca Mountain is a hot-button issue in Nevada. The idea of storing up to 110,000 metric tons of highly radioactive spent fuel from nuclear power plants has few fans inside the state. President Donald Trump supports the plan and put $110 million into his proposed budget to move it forward. With broad bipartisan support, the House voted overwhelmingly May 10 to have the Energy Department plan and build out the storage site. Democrat Jacky Rosen’s Senate campaign fired off a press release tying incumbent Sen. Dean Heller, R-Nev., to the House vote. "Heller couldn’t even stop his close friend of more than a decade, House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy, from bringing the Yucca Mountain bill to the floor for today’s vote," the press release said. "Heller has voted for a GOP budget that funded efforts to revive Yucca Mountain, and he voted to confirm President Trump’s pro-Yucca budget director last year." We decided to look at the statement that Heller voted for a Republican budget that advanced the Yucca Mountain waste repository. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com The 2011 vote The Rosen campaign’s press release linked to an April 12, 2011, article in the Las Vegas Sun. The story said a House budget provision that would have revived the Yucca Mountain proposal had died in the Senate. There’s a lot of history here. With the prospect of waste building up at nuclear power plants across the country, Congress passed the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982. In 1987, it amended the act to make Yucca Mountain the only option for Energy Department planning. Jump forward to 2009. The site had met the safety requirements of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, but the Obama administration, citing broad opposition in Nevada, put things on hold. In 2011, House Republicans added a rider to their budget that barred the Nuclear Regulatory Commission from doing anything to close the Yucca Mountain site. The formal text was: "No funds ... may be used by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission to conduct closure of adjudicatory functions, technical review, or support activities associated with the Yucca Mountain geologic repository license application." So, while the bill didn’t specify any particular sum to open the site, this rider denied money to roll back the planning process. A big budget bill The rider was part of an appropriations package that reached virtually every government agency. The bill funded defense, health and human services, agriculture, and more. According to the Congressional Budget Office, the total price tag was $1.3 trillion. Heller, then a House representative, voted for the bill, which passed pretty much down straight party lines. Every Democrat and only three Republicans voted against it. The Rosen press release singles out the element related to Yucca Mountain, but as is always the case with budget bills, they are about much more than just one issue. It’s also true that Heller tried to remove the Yucca Mountain rider. He offered an amendment that would have prevented any money going toward the Yucca Mountain Nuclear Waste Repository. That amendment failed on a voice vote. Stewart Boss with the Rosen campaign said they stand by their press release. "When a partisan budget bill with a controversial Yucca Mountain funding provision came to a vote in 2011, Senator Heller weakly tried and failed to remove the funding," Boss said. Heller is on the record as opposing the facility. In 2017, he testified before a House Oversight and Government Reform subcommittee, saying "This ill-conceived project would not only cause significant harm to the well-being of my home state and all Nevadans, but also poses a national security risk that is too great to ignore." Heller has continued to argue against Yucca Mountain funding in letters to appropriators, including this one in April. Our ruling The Rosen campaign said that Heller "has voted for a GOP bill that funded efforts to revive Yucca Mountain." The GOP bill that got Heller's vote didn’t provide money so much as it barred the Nuclear Regulatory Commission from spending money to roll back the licensing process for the waste repository site. Heller floated an amendment that would have barred spending any money on the site at all. Offering an amendment is not the same as waging a knock-down, drag-out fight, but Heller’s amendment would have stymied the intent of the Republican language. Back then and today, Heller’s official policy is to oppose the Yucca Mountain plan. All of this took place in the context of a massive spending measure. To focus on a single element in a $1.3 trillion bill amounts to legislative cherry-picking. We rate this claim Mostly False.

pomt-08977	As a Congressman, J.D. Hayworth was an avid earmarker who supported such pork as "$220,000 to renovate a Maine Blueberry farm" and "$5.8 million for a Vermont snowmobile trail."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/jul/16/john-mccain/john-mccain-labels-jd-hayworth-avid-earmarker/	Sen. John McCain has long been known as a flag-carrier for earmark reform. And his hard line against pork projects has often put him at odds with fellow Arizona lawmakers trying to make sure that Arizona got its fair share. But McCain's principled stance also makes for rich campaign ad material. In a McCain attack ad on J.D. Hayworth, his Republican opponent in the Arizona primary, an announcer says that while McCain "wages a determined battle against pork barrel spending," J.D. Hayworth as a U.S. Congressman from Arizona from 1995 to 2007 was "described as an 'avid earmarker,' and supported thousands of earmarks worth billions of dollars before we voted him out of office." The ad then runs a list of earmarks contained in bills that Hayworth voted for, and that McCain voted against. We picked two of them to put this issue into some context: * $220,000 to renovate Maine blueberry farm * $5.8 million for Vermont snowmobile trail The first earmark was part of a $375 billion Omnibus appropriations bill passed by Congress in 2004. According to a conference report attached to the bill, it did indeed include, "$220,000 for the University of Maine (Jonesboro and Orono), Blueberry Hill Farm to renovate the blueberry research facility." The shorthand in the McCain ad is perhaps one part hyperbole -- calling it money for a blueberry farm rather than money for a university-run blueberry research facility. But it's close enough. The bill passed the House 242-176; and Hayworth voted for it. The bill passed the Senate comfortably as well, 65-28. McCain voted against it and was very clear that it was because of the hundreds of earmarks it contained. "It appears that the big spenders in this body have all but stolen the credit card numbers of every hard-working taxpayer in America and have gone on a limitless spending spree for parochial pork-barrel projects, leaving Americans to pay and pay," McCain said from the floor of the Senate at the time. The second project, for the snowmobile trail, was tucked into a $286 billion highway and mass transit bill that passed in 2006. In addition to paying for the interstate highway system and other federal highway programs, the bill included more than 6,000 earmarks (including the now infamous "Bridge to Nowhere" in Alaska) worth a total of about $24 billion. According to a committee report attached to the bill, it included $5.8 million for "construction of the Lamoille Valley Rail Trail for the Vermont Association of Snow Travelers." The bill passed overwhelmingly: 412 to 8 in the House (Hayworth voted for it); and 91 to 4 in the Senate. McCain, who voted against it, called the bill a "monstrosity" and added, "It would seem that this Congress can weather any storm thrown at it, as long as we have our pork lifesaver to cling to." So there's no question Hayworth voted for bills that included the two earmarks from McCain's campaign ad. But is it fair to call Hayworth an "avid earmarker" (a moniker given to Hayworth in a Feb. 21, 2010, opinion piece from the Arizona Republic's Robert Robb) and to say that he supported those particular projects? Hayworth addressed the ad's claims via a video response on his campaign website. Hayworth said the McCain campaign is "playing a cynical Washington game." "They took an appropriations bill in a huge area, let's say for example in an area like transportation, and they highlighted controversial provisions in that appropriations bill," Hayworth said. "Now understand, when you serve in the U.S. Congress or the Senate, you don't have the luxury of saying, 'Well, I like this particular provision but not the other one.' In other words, you vote for that transportation bill either up or down." Hayworth is right that those particular earmarks -- for the blueberry farm and snowmobile trail -- never came up for an up or down vote on their own merits. They were included in massive appropriations bills and represented a minuscule fraction of the overall bills. While it's impossible to say whether Hayworth supported the particular earmarks cited in the McCain ad, it is fair to say he was okay with the process. A July 29, 2005, press release issued by his congressional office boasts that "Rep. Hayworth was able to earmark millions of dollars in the (transportation) bill for specific projects in his district, as requested by local elected officials and state transportation officials." A March 31, 2004, story in the Arizona Republic detailed $52.5 million worth of earmarks for Arizona folded into a $275 billion transportation bill. And Hayworth defended them. "Call it earmarks, call it authorized projects, call it pork or whatever," Hayworth told the Arizona Republic. "The fact is, these projects reflect the priorities of local and state officials to help our transportation infrastructure keep pace with the extraordinary growth we are experiencing in the East Valley." Steve Ellis of Taxpayers for Common Sense, a nonpartisan Washington advocacy group that tracks earmarks, said voting for the appropriations bills was an endorsement of the process, and therefore all the earmarks in them. "At the end of the day, if you have to hold your nose and vote for a bill, then you have to deal with the fallout," Ellis said. "If everybody just goes along to get along, the status quo remains," Ellis said. "If enough people stand up and fight, that's how you effect change." We think it is misleading to suggest that Hayworth specifically supported the blueberry farm and snowmobile trail projects in those massive appropriations bills. In fact, we doubt he even knew those particular projects were even in the bill. But Hayworth knew the bills contained billions in earmarks, and he even boasted in a press release about some of the earmarks he included for Arizona. From where we sit, if you boast to constituents about the earmarks you brought to your home state, then you've got to live with the earmarks other legislators brought to theirs. And those projects listed in the McCain ad were among them. We rate the ad's claims Mostly True.	None	John McCain	None	None	None	2010-07-16T16:44:57	2010-05-26	['None']
pomt-08919	"For every dollar we put in unemployment, it pays back about $1.60."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/jul/27/jeanne-shaheen/lawmaker-claims-unemployment-benefits-boost-econom/	Extending aid to the unemployed is not only the "right" thing to do, it is also one of the best ways to stimulate economic growth. That, at least, is what has become a frequent talking point, especially among Democratic lawmakers. New Hampshire Senator Jeanne Shaheen reiterated the argument during a recent MSNBC interview. "This is one of the best things we can do to help stimulate the economy, because for every dollar we put in unemployment, it pays back about $1.60. And we know that people who are on unemployment are going to go out, and they're going to spend that money, they're going to pay for groceries at their local grocery store, they're going to buy gas in their car." Using a dollar to make $1.60 sounds like a dream come true, so we decided to look into it. Shaheen's office told us that the number comes from Mark Zandi, the chief economist for Moody's Economy.com and a former adviser to John McCain during the 2008 presidential campaign. During testimony before the Senate Finance Committee on April 14, 2010, Zandi called on lawmakers to provide emergency benefits to individuals who have lost their jobs. "No form of the fiscal stimulus has proved more effective during the past two years than emergency UI benefits," Zandi said, using the abbreviation for unemployment insurance. Specifically, he calculated that for every dollar spent in benefits, the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) grows by $1.61 one year later. Next, we looked at a report issued in January 2010 by the Congressional Budget Office (CBO), the official nonpartisan number-cruncher for Congress. In its discussion of increasing unemployment aid, the report noted that the proposal is "both timely and cost-effective in spurring economic activity and employment." For every dollar spent, the CBO wrote, the GDP would increase by anywhere from $0.70 to $1.90 per year from 2010 to 2015. What accounts for such a large variation? Till von Wachter, an associate professof of economics at Columbia University, told us that this sort of a range "is typical in this kind of empirical analysis." He said that one possible reason is "because different estimation methods or specifications give slightly different results." David Card from the University of California-Berkeley added that the uncertainty "presumably illustrates the sad state of knowledge in the field." So, Shaheen is right on target if we go by Zandi's numbers, but she picked a number that's in the upper range of CBO's estimated range. Still, there is more to the story. For one, there is considerable question among academics about the accuracy of the unemployment benefits' "multiplier effects." Robert Barro, a Harvard economist, pointed out that before spending on unemployment benefits goes up, the GDP goes down, which makes it difficult to come up with a "serious estimate" of the impact of unemployment benefits. Lawrence Katz, also from Harvard, said that he has "many qualms with these standard macro forecasting models." Still, Katz also pointed out that the current models are "the best we have right now to make such forecasts." Alan Reynolds, an economist from the libertarian-leaning CATO Institute, wrote in a January 29, 2010 blog post that Zandi's econometric model relies on assumptions that are contradicted by contemporary academic research. There are also some researchers who maintain that not only does increased spending on unemployment provides minimal economic boost, but also that it may decrease output in the long run, in part because the government will have to recoup money paid out in benefits through increased taxes. In a November 2008 report, scholars Karen Campbell and James Sherk from the conservative Heritage Foundation argue that existing studies on the subject are flawed, because they do not take into account that unemployment insurance reduces workers' incentives to work. The pro-benefits studies also assume that every dollar of spending funds new consumption, they said. Many studies since the 1970s "have concluded that unemployment insurance plays at best a small role in stabilizing the economy," the report argued. Campbell added, however, that though she does not believe that economic stimulus is a good argument for extending benefits, welfare arguments could be made for doing so. To recap: Sen. Shaheen said that "for every dollar we put in unemployment it, pays back about $1.60." The CBO said that the increase is actually anywhere from $.70 to $1.90, so she picked a number that's on the high end of that estimate. She's right on target if we go by Mark Zandi's economic study, but many of the scholars we spoke with are critical of attempts to accurately estimate the effect that spending on unemployment insurance has on the GDP. We rate this Half True.	None	Jeanne Shaheen	None	None	None	2010-07-27T13:18:05	2010-07-20	['None']
pomt-08970	Russ Feingold "voted against the law that protected our lakes" and "was the only Great Lakes senator to vote no."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/jul/19/ron-johnson/ron-johnson-campaign-ad-blasts-russ-feingold-recor/	The oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico is at the top of the news, but the political ripples are being felt far and wide. In Wisconsin, Democratic Sen. Russ Feingold and Republican challenger Ron Johnson have gotten into a bit of mudslinging over who would be better at protecting the Great Lakes from drilling. Feingold started the war of words by charging in a 30-second ad that Johnson "is willing to hand over the Great Lakes to the oil companies, threatening Wisconsin’s economy, and a way of life for generations of Wisconsin families." Johnson quickly shot back with a statement saying in part, "I would not support any efforts to overturn the provision which outlaws drilling in the Great Lakes as Wisconsin’s next U.S. Senator. Let me repeat: I would reject any and all efforts to drill in the Great Lakes." Johnson drove home that theme in a 30-second television ad. In the ad, viewers see a car spinning its wheels in the mud. "Twenty-eight years in politics and Russ Feingold’s stuck in the mud," the narrator says. "Feingold started his campaign slinging mud at Ron Johnson. Ron Johnson opposes drilling in the Great Lakes, and Russ Feingold knows it. Drilling is already illegal in the Great Lakes, and Feingold knows that too. Because he voted against the law that protected our lakes. That’s right. Feingold was the only Great Lakes senator to vote no. Feingold played politics. Partisan politician Russ Feingold. Stuck in the mud." In this item, we won't get into the question of whether Johnson opposes drilling in the Great Lakes. But we thought we'd sort out whether Feingold had indeed voted against a bill to ban Great Lakes drilling. The bill that Johnson's ad refers to is the Energy Policy Act of 2005. A provision of that law -- Section 386 -- reads, "No Federal or State permit or lease shall be issued for new oil and gas slant, directional, or offshore drilling in or under one or more of the Great Lakes." A check of the Senate roll call vote on the final version of that bill confirms that Feingold voted "nay." Case closed? Not quite. The claim requires several caveats. • Feingold wasn't voting against the bill because of the drilling ban. The bill in question was championed by President George W. Bush, Vice President Dick Cheney, most congressional Republicans and some Democrats. Nineteen Democrats, six Republicans and one independent voted against the bill, which passed, 74-26. At the time, Feingold cited several reasons for voting against the bill. "This bill digs us deeper into a budget black hole," Feingold said, according to his home state newspaper, the Milwaukee Journal-Sentinel. "It fails to decrease our dependence on foreign oil. It rolls back important consumer protections. And finally, it undermines some of the fundamental environmental laws that our citizens rely upon." He also cited the bill's repeal of the Public Utility Holding Company Act, its changes to the Clean Water Act and its exemption of hydraulic fracking -- a controversial technique for retrieving underground natural gas -- from the Safe Drinking Water Act. He most certainly didn't vote against it because it included a Great Lakes drilling ban. Quite the contrary: Feingold's camp points out that in 2001, the senator was an original co-sponsor of the Great Lakes Water Protection Act, which directed the Environmental Protection Agency Administrator to conduct a study on known and potential environmental effects of oil and gas drilling on land beneath the water in the Great Lakes. (The bill did not advance.) Feingold also sponsored or supported numerous other bills to protect the Great Lakes specifically and clean water generally. The Johnson camp told PolitiFact that "our ad never insinuates Sen. Feingold did not support a 2001 bill regarding Great Lakes or make any other statement about whether or not he supports drilling in the Great Lakes." But we think a reasonable person could come away with the ad wondering whether Feingold is somehow opposed to a ban on Great Lakes drilling. And that would be incorrect. That said, congressional bills often have hundreds or thousands of provisions. Most of the time, lawmakers who vote yes on a bill don't agree with everything in it, and when they vote for it because of the many things they do agree with, they must be prepared for critics to point out the discrepancies. So we think Johnson deserves some leeway for legitimately catching Feingold voting against something he says he supports. • There wasn't just one law that curbed drilling in the Great Lakes. The ad says that Russ Feingold "voted against the law that protected our lakes." That makes it sound like there was one law that accomplished that purpose, and that Feingold missed his chance to support it. That's incorrect. There were actually four, one of which was permanent -- the one cited in the ad -- and three of which were temporary. All did essentially the same thing. According to the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service, "Congress had enacted a temporary ban on any new federal and state permits for drilling under the Great Lakes in 2001 (P.L. 107-66; Title V, §503) and extended it to 2007. This temporary ban was in addition to several state bans on drilling in or under the Great Lakes." So we looked up the 2001 law to see whether Feingold voted for it. He did. (The bill passed overwhelmingly, 96-2.) Specifically, it was the Energy and Water Development Appropriations Act of 2002, which included a provision that said that "during the fiscal years 2002 and 2003, no federal or state permit or lease shall be issued for new oil and gas slant, directional, or offshore drilling in or under one or more of the Great Lakes." We also looked up the extension for 2004 and 2005, which passed as part of the Consolidated Appropriations Resolution of 2003 -- a massive federal spending bill. In this case, Feingold voted no. Finally, we looked up the law that extended the ban through 2006 and 2007. It was the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2005. Feingold voted no on that one too. So Feingold actually voted for one temporary ban and voted against three (two of them temporary, one permanent). All were buried in much broader bills, and his camp says he opposed those bills despite the drilling ban provision, not because of it. At the same time, even though he only batted one for four, Feingold has a right to say that in one case, he voted for a "law that protected our lakes." • Feingold was not the only Great Lakes senator to vote no on the 2005 bill. Johnson cited yes votes by senators from Minnesota, Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, Ohio, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. But he excluded New York state, which borders Lake Ontario and Lake Erie. Both New York senators at the time -- Democrats Hillary Clinton and Charles Schumer -- joined Feingold in voting no. The Johnson campaign told PolitiFact that "including or excluding two New York City senators as Great Lakes senators is subjective, and many government and academic sources do not group New York in the Great Lakes region." They cited the Great Lakes Regional Water Program University of Wisconsin Extension (which defines the Great Lakes Region as "Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, Minnesota, Ohio, and Wisconsin"), the Bureau of Economic Analysis (which defines the Great Lakes Region as "Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, Ohio, and Wisconsin"), and the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (which defines the Great Lakes Region as "Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, Ohio, and Wisconsin"). But we think the implication that Clinton and Schumer somehow forfeit their right to represent residents on Lake Ontario and Lake Erie is ridiculous. In addition, if the campaign was going to use these three alternate groupings as gospel, they should have also eliminated Pennsylvania, which does not appear in any of the three they cite. But they didn't: The Johnson campaign's backup sheet for the ad cites Pennsylvania, but not New York. This strikes us as cherry picking. We find no good rationale for excluding New York, so on this count, we find Johnson's ad clearly inaccurate. So let's sum up. Feingold did vote against a bill that included the permanent ban on Great Lakes drilling, and also voted against two of the bills with temporary bans, though for reasons unrelated to the drilling ban provision. As a result, Johnson has some justification for saying that Feingold "voted against the law that protected our lakes." But the ad ignores that Feingold supported one of the temporary bans, and that he has a long record of protecting the environmental quality of the Great Lakes, including championing at least one bill that dealt directly with drilling. Meanwhile, we don't buy the campaign's rationale for excluding New York from the list of Great Lakes states. That fundamentally undercuts the ad's claim that Feingold was the only Great Lakes senator to vote against the 2005 bill. On balance, we rate the ad Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.

pomt-05640	President Barack Obama is "ending Medicare as we know it."	pants on fire!	/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/mar/22/mitt-romney/mitt-romney-says-barack-obama-ending-medicare-we-k/	Mitt Romney is trying to turn the tables on President Barack Obama by using a favorite Democratic line against him, accusing Obama of "ending Medicare as we know it." That's been a trusty line for the Democrats, with variations used in campaign commercials and press releases over the past couple of years. It was used to criticize Republicans who supported Rep. Paul Ryan's plan to dramatically change Medicare and was uttered so often that we chose it as 2011 Lie of the Year. But this time, it's coming from a Republican against the Democratic president. The Romney campaign used it in a news release that listed five questions, each beginning with "Why is President Obama ending Medicare as we know it..." • "by allowing it to go bankrupt in less than 15 years?" • "by funding Obamacare through $500 billion In Medicare cuts for today’s seniors?" • "by creating an unaccountable board to ration care for today’s seniors?" • "by destroying Medicare Advantage for today’s seniors?" • "by ending access to care for today’s seniors?" Scaring senior citizens about Medicare has long been a part of both parties' playbooks. But we hadn't heard of any plan from President Obama to dramatically alter the senior health care plan, so we thought it worthwhile to check the claim. It's important to note that Obama's plan for Medicare hasn't been as big and sweeping as Ryan's. It has involved cutting the growth of future spending, particularly in the Medicare Advantage program and establishing a board to make recommendations about future savings. But he has not outlined a dramatic, structural overhaul or a fundamental redefinition of the program. We found that Romney was stringing together a series of flimsy and often contradictory facts to justify an over-the-top statement. Let's take Romney's points one by one: Is Medicare going bankrupt? As PolitiFact Georgia has written -- and as Medicare’s government trustees declare every year -- Medicare does have big financial problems. Medicare is funded by two separate trust funds run by the federal government. According to the most recent annual report of the Medicare trustees, the trust fund for Medicare Part B, which covers doctors visits and outpatient costs, and part D, which covers prescription drugs, is in reasonably good shape, though not without longer-term worries. The other trust fund, covering inpatient hospital care, home health care and services at skilled nursing facilities and hospices, is under greater fiscal stress. Tax income and dedicated revenues "are expected to fall short" of expenditures "in all future years," the trustees wrote. The fund doesn't meet overall benchmarks for fiscal balance in either the short or the long term. The fund is expected to be exhausted by 2024, or possibly as soon as 2016 in a worst-case scenario. Still, not even this grim outlook translates into Obama "allowing (Medicare) to go bankrupt in less than 15 years," as the Romney memo claims. First, it is a significant exaggeration to blame Medicare's situation entirely on the incumbent president. Decisions over nearly 50 years by many presidents and members of Congress have put the program on an unsustainable path. You could just as easily substitute the name of a Republican president or a GOP congressional leader who would have to share at least some responsibility for the financial situation. The Medicare trustees don’t use the word "bankrupt" in their report, and it’s not clear that Medicare’s situation fits the two definitions of "bankrupt" we’ve used in the past -- to be "declared in law unable to pay outstanding debts" or "reduced to a state of financial ruin: impoverished." Medicare is a government program; the government will have the ability to pay its bills, however financially painful that may become. Meanwhile, only one of the funds is considered in fiscal peril, and that peril could be headed off through benefit cuts or higher taxes. Historically, Congress has intervened when funds appeared to be running out. "Almost from its inception, the (Part A) trust fund has faced a projected shortfall," the Congressional Research Service has written. In 1970, the insolvency date was 1972. For the next 16 years, trustees expected its funds to be exhausted by the 1990s. Congress repeatedly acted to lower fund spending and keep it from going dry. Overall, we find it is a ridiculous exaggeration to say that Obama is personally responsible for Medicare's financial woes. Is Obama funding his health care law by $500 billion in Medicare cuts? First off, we’ll note that this argument is an odd contradiction. In the first point, Romney argued that Obama is responsible for Medicare's financial peril. This one criticizes him for ... cutting its costs. We previously checked a virtually identical claim by Romney, that "Obamacare takes $500 billion out of Medicare and funds Obamacare." We ruled it Half True, though other times we’ve given different ratings to this general topic due to variations in how the claim was worded. The health care reform law made several changes to Medicare. In a few cases, it actually increased Medicare spending to provide more benefits and coverage. The law added money to cover preventive services and to fill a gap (or "doughnut hole") for enrollees who purchase prescription drugs through the Medicare Part D program. Other provisions are designed to reduce future growth in Medicare spending, to encourage the program to operate more efficiently and to improve the delivery and quality of care in ways that include reducing hospital re-admissions. The bill doesn't take money out of the current Medicare budget but instead attempts to slow the program's future growth in provider payments, combined with premium hikes for higher-income beneficiaries and administrative changes. Medicare spending will still increase, however. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office projects Medicare spending will reach $929 billion in 2020, up from $499 billion in actual spending in 2009. Romney is right that future savings from Medicare are planned to offset new costs created by the law -- especially coverage for the uninsured -- so that the overall law doesn't add to the deficit. However, the way Romney phrases it gives the impression that the law takes money already allocated to Medicare and uses it to fund the new health care law. Instead, the law uses a number of measures to try to reduce the rapid growth of future Medicare spending -- something that, paradoxically, would help ease the concerns laid out in Romney’s previous claim, that Medicare could "go bankrupt in less than 15 years." So that doesn't support the sweeping claim that Obama is "changing Medicare as we know it." He's changed it, but not drastically. Does the health care law create an "unaccountable board to ration care"? The Independent Payment Advisory Board, or IPAB, with 15 members who are political appointees, is charged with identifying $15.5 billion in Medicare savings. PolitiFact and its affiliates have checked similar claims and typically found they were significant exaggerations. Here, we’ll first ask: Is IPAB unaccountable? The answer is: No. Members are chosen by the president and confirmed by the Senate. The board would not issue edicts. It would make recommendations. If Congress does not act on its recommendations within a set time, the recommendations are automatically implemented. But Congress has other opportunities to intervene. According to a Kaiser Family Foundation analysis, the full House and Senate may consider amendments that change or repeal the board's recommendations as long as those changes meet the same fiscal criteria as the board itself uses. Congress is even granted a one-time opportunity to introduce legislation to dismantle IPAB permanently. This would require approval between January 2017 and Aug. 15, 2017, with the support of three-fifths of the members of the House and Senate. So Congress has multiple ways to intervene. This negates the argument that its actions are "unaccountable." Second, would IPAB ration care? No. The law specifically bars it from doing that. The panel is forbidden from submitting "any recommendation to ration health care," according to Section 3403 of the health care law. The types of recommendations the board is permitted to make are also sharply limited. It may not suggest raising premiums for Medicare beneficiaries or increase deductibles, coinsurance or co-payments. The board also may not urge changes to Medicare eligibility, the scope of benefits or initiatives to raise revenue. Instead, what it is permitted to do is reduce how much the government pays health-care providers for services, for instance, by reducing payments to hospitals with high rates of re-admissions or recommending innovations to cut wasteful spending. The Romney campaign argues that IPAB’s actions will have the effect of rationing care. If the reimbursement rate for mammograms is cut low enough, the campaign argues, doctors would face the choice of continuing to provide the same services for diminishing payments or else stop providing the services entirely. But as we’ve argued before, if that’s rationing, then it’s not substantially different from the type of unofficial rationing that existed before passage of the health care law (and continues to exist today, before much of it is in force). People who couldn't get health insurance due to a pre-existing condition or their financial situation felt like there was already rationing. And even for those with insurance, not every type of care was covered. "Everyone hates the word rationing," Katherine Baicker, a health economics professor at Harvard University, told us in 2009. "From an economics perspective, there's no way around rationing. Some care is being rationed now. Everyone isn't getting everything." So, IPAB doesn’t break any new ground in "rationing," and the board is still accountable to Congress. Is Obama destroying Medicare Advantage? The health care law includes $136 billion in projected savings that would come from changes to the Medicare Advantage program -- a privately run, Medicare-funded plan akin to managed care health insurance. The Romney camp points to a study that supports the argument that these changes will destroy Medicare Advantage. It projects that "nationwide, compared to what would have been the case under prior law, by 2017, when the changes are fully phased-in, enrollment (in Medicare Advantage) is projected to be 50 percent lower, the average would-be beneficiary will lose $3,700 in benefits (accounting for both those who remain in MA and those who leave) and the number of choices available in the average county will be reduced by about two-thirds." We don’t have any contrary data, but we’ll note that the report was written by Robert A. Book, a former scholar at the conservative Heritage Foundation, and Michael Ramlet, the director of health care policy at the American Action Forum, a group whose board includes a long list of Republican stalwarts. So we think the report is worth taking with a grain of salt. There’s no question that Medicare Advantage is taking a disproportionate share of the cuts made by the new law. But "destroying" is too strong a word -- few doubt that Medicare Advantage will continue to exist and draw beneficiaries. And these savings need to be taken in some context. "The Affordable Care Act reduces payments to Medicare Advantage plans," Jonathan Oberlander, health policy professor at the University of North Carolina School of Medicine, told us in 2011. "They’re overpaid by quite a lot -- excess payments above and beyond what it costs to treat people," he said. "As a result of that, there are projections that some of those (plans) are going to trim some of the extra benefits." Those could include benefits for vision or dental care, he said, but "it doesn’t affect the core benefits, the required Medicare benefits." And once again, we’ll point out that if Romney is concerned about Medicare possibly going "bankrupt" in the future, it’s paradoxical to simultaneously argue against lowering reimbursements to a portion of Medicare that is already paid higher-than-average amounts. Is Obama ending access to care for today’s seniors? This is a stunningly sweeping claim, with virtually nothing to back it up. Are Medicare beneficiaries really being left without any doctors or hospitals to go to? The campaign points to a projection by Medicare’s actuary that one provision in the law could squeeze health care reimbursements so much that about 15 percent of health care providers "could find it difficult to remain profitable and, absent legislative intervention, might end their participation in the program (possibly jeopardizing access to care for beneficiaries)," the actuary wrote. Coming from an independent federal official, this assessment seems credible. But health care experts -- while acknowledging the risks of squeezing providers -- caution against concluding that many of Medicare’s providers will flee the program. One reason is Medicare’s market dominance. "If hospitals don’t serve Medicare patients, who exactly are they going to care for?" Oberlander asks. "Same goes for most physicians. Without Medicare patients, they would have very empty waiting rooms." History backs up this view, said Jonathan Gruber, a Massachusetts Institute of Technology health care policy specialist who has advised both Romney and Obama in the past. "We have seen major cuts in Medicare reimbursement in the past, most notably for hospitals in 1997, where there were cuts that were much larger than those in" Obama’s law, yet none resulted in widespread defections, Gruber said. It’s also worth noting that the new law is not the only source of cost adjustments that could squeeze margins for providers. The most notable is Medicare’s Sustainable Growth Rate, which (at least theoretically) caps physician reimbursement in the program based on a formula. We say "theoretical" because Congress has always acted to head off its implementation before the required cuts took effect. And that's been going on since it was first put into law in 1997. "This would have been a problem regardless of whether the ACA ever became law, so connecting it to ‘Obamacare’ is just false," Oberlander said. Summing up We’ll evaluate Romney’s claim in two steps. First, how accurate are his five claims? And second, do they collectively indicate that Obama is "ending Medicare as we know it"? The claim that Obama is funding his health care law by $500 billion in Medicare cuts has the most merit, but three of the other claims greatly exaggerate a nugget of truth. Medicare has serious financial challenges in its future, but saying it will go "bankrupt" in less than 15 years is highly misleading. Meanwhile, Obama’s law certainly targets Medicare Advantage for cuts, but it’s not at all clear that those cuts will "destroy" the program. And Medicare’s fiscal pressures and the possibility of reduced payments to providers do pose challenges for Medicare’s ability to keep physicians and hospitals in its network, but its sheer size gives it market power that make it difficult for physicians to leave. As for Romney’s claim about IPAB, we see little if any truth in it. Our ruling Overall, then, the Romney news release is a talking point in search of facts. It takes some shreds of truth and combines them with worst-case-scenario speculations, then deploys overheated language. Even if each of his five claims were true, it would be a stretch to say that they added up to "ending Medicare as we know it." But given their degree of inaccuracy, the memo doesn’t have a leg to stand on. We interpret "ending Medicare as we know it" to mean a fundamental, structural change to the program, one so significant that it is almost unrecognizable as a result. Romney’s charge that Obama would "end Medicare as we know it" is at least as overheated as the Democratic charge that the Ryan plan would "end Medicare." Under Obama’s approach, Medicare would still be a large, single-payer, federally run health care program for seniors -- slimmer in some areas, more generous in others, with a smattering of different rules. That’s not "ending Medicare as we know it," which is just the latest line in a long history of political attempts to scare seniors. We rate Romney’s claim Pants on Fire.

pomt-06850	"I cut more as a percentage out of government than any state in the country this past decade. And where is Michigan in terms of its economic growth? Cutting did not result in economic growth."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/aug/04/jennifer-granholm/jennifer-granholm-says-massive-government-cuts-mic/	During the July 31, 2011, edition of NBC’s Meet the Press, Jennifer Granholm -- a Democrat who served as governor of Michigan from 2003 to 2011 -- was asked to bring her own experience to bear on the debate over the federal debt ceiling. "Clearly the entitlement question has to be addressed," Granholm said, referring to the rising cost of Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid, which is a major contributor to the growing federal debt. However, Granholm told host David Gregory that she was skeptical about whether such cuts would be a boon for the economy at large. "I can tell you, David, I cut more as a percentage out of government than any state in the country this past decade," Granholm said. "And where is Michigan in terms of its economic growth? Cutting did not result in economic growth. What results in growth is making sure you've got a good business climate for businesses to grow and prosper. And so we've got to cut where we can in order to invest where we must in order to grow the economy. And it's that investment side that I worry that those who are affiliated with the tea party or who are on the far right don't realize that other countries are co-investing with businesses in order to create jobs in their countries. "If we do nothing more than just cut," she continued, "that will continue to accelerate the lack of growth in (gross domestic product). So we've got to realize that the strategy here must be very specific. Yes, you've got to reform entitlements, but you've got reform entitlements and invest in order to grow because the quickest way to take down your deficit is through growth." We wondered about three elements of Granholm’s comments: whether she "cut more as a percentage out of government than any state in the country this past decade," how poor Michigan’s economic growth has been over the same period and whether spending cuts to state government hampered economic growth. (Separately, we’re looking at a comment from the same show by Rep. Raul Labrador, R-Idaho, in which he accused Granholm of supporting "the highest tax increases in the history of Michigan," which helped push unemployment "from 6.8 percent to 15.3 percent.) We’ll take up the three claims in order. Did Michigan cut more from its government than any state in the country? To answer this question, we turned to The Fiscal Survey of States, a twice-annual publication of the National Association of State Budget Officers that offers fiscal data for the 50 states going back to 1979. We determined that the most appropriate data to use were figures for annual expenditures from the 50 states’ general funds. We’ll acknowledge up front that this is not the only measure that could be used to compare how much state governments have been cut. In fact, Michigan’s state revenues flow into two accounts, the general fund and the school-aid fund, and the numbers we looked at only take into account the general fund. However, fiscal experts told us that the general fund offers a reasonable yardstick for state spending, and it also turned out to be the same measurement Granholm used, according to a spokeswoman. (Then there’s the eternal statistician’s lament: When comparing all 50 states across a period of nearly a decade, you take the statistics you can get.) We calculated the change in general fund expenditures for all 50 states between fiscal year 2003 and fiscal year 2010 -- the closest approximation we could get to the start and end dates of Granholm’s tenure. And by this measure, Granholm is right. Every state but two saw their general-fund expenditures increase over that period (without taking inflation into account). The two that didn’t? Georgia, which saw its general fund expenditures fall by $54 million over that period, and Michigan, which saw its general fund expenditures fall by more than $1 billion. If they’d been adjusted for inflation, the decrease would be even more severe. Using another measure, Carole Polan, a spokeswoman for Granholm, added that from 2000 to 2008, the number of state employees fell by about 11,000 -- a 17 percent decline. That was a more rapid decline than in private employment, which fell in the state by 12 percent over the same period, Polan said. We’ll address the causes of these declines in a moment, but for now, we can say that by this measure, Granholm is right that spending on government declined faster in Michigan than in any other state between 2003 and 2010. How poor was Michigan’s economic growth during Granholm’s tenure? To answer this question, we looked at gross domestic product data for Michigan as published by the U.S. Commerce Department’s Bureau of Economic Analysis. (Just as the bureau calculates the national gross domestic product, it does the same for individual states.) Once again, we compared Michigan’s GDP for 2003 and 2010. By this measure too, Michigan performed worst in the nation. Its gross domestic product rose by 6 percent over that period (again, not adjusted for inflation). That may sound okay, but it’s not. It’s only about one-third the rate of the next worst-performing state -- Ohio, at 17 percent growth. And it’s less than one-fifth of the increase of the nation as a whole, which was 31 percent. So where economic growth is concerned, Granholm is right again: Michigan’s performance during her tenure was uniquely poor among the 50 states. Did spending cuts to state government hamper Michigan’s economic growth? The cuts to government almost certainly hampered Michigan’s economy. But experts say that they weren’t the primary cause of the state’s poor economic performance. Long-term troubles in the automotive industry, the national recession and raising taxes on businesses and individuals "were all partially to blame," said Patrick L. Anderson, an economic analyst in East Lansing, Mich., who wrote a report released by Granholm's successor elected in 2010, Republican Rick Snyder. Charles Ballard, an economist at Michigan State University and author of Michigan's Economic Future: A New Look, added that even before the national economic crisis of 2008, "the auto industry limped along for much of the decade, with General Motors, Ford and Chrysler losing market share steadily. In Michigan, we don’t have Honda plants -- we have GM, Ford and Chrysler plants. Two of those companies went into bankruptcy. For better or for worse, we are home to the portions of the industry that did the worst." Meanwhile, Ballard added that Michigan’s tax structure -- which doesn’t tax most services or Internet sales and mail-order -- exacerbated the fiscal impact of these economic problems. If the sectors that aren’t taxed are growing faster than those that are, "the sales tax applies to an ever-shrinking portion of the economy," Ballard said. "So if you put the tax law on autopilot, the portion of your economy going to tax revenues shrinks every year." In fact, "Michigan’s revenues peaked in 2000 and are not projected to return to peak until 2020," said Arturo Perez, a state budget analyst with the National Conference of State Legislatures. "No other state has had a similar revenue situation." Given this backdrop, a more appropriate way of thinking about it is that a poor economy in Michigan caused a drop in state tax revenue, which in turn forced Granholm to cut government services -- not the other way around. Declining tax revenue is a much more urgent factor for state governments than for the federal government, since most states are constrained from using deficit spending. (Michigan is one, though "unavoidable deficits" may be resolved in the next fiscal year.) This means that tax revenues play a more direct role in determining spending levels than they do at the federal level. "The plain fact is that state economic growth rates are in the short run linked to the demand for products that are produced in the state -- products like autos in Michigan, oil in Texas, sunny vacations in Florida and gambling holidays in Nevada," said Gary Burtless, an economist with the centrist-to-liberal Brookings Institution. "Demand for these products can have booms and busts that are completely unrelated to a state’s typical tax rate or spending level. In the short run, when demand for a state’s products plummets, its state tax revenues fall, forcing the state to trim state spending or increase state tax rates." Our ruling There’s strong evidence supporting two of Granholm’s statistical claims -- that government spending has fallen faster in Michigan than in any other state, and that the state’s economic performance has been especially poor compared to other states. However, in the Meet the Press interview, Granholm was trying to use her experience as a governor to make a larger point about how cutting government "did not result in economic growth." She's probably correct that government cuts hampered her state's recovery, at least in the short term, but Michigan’s experience over the last decade suggests that the reverse is an even bigger factor -- that is, poor economic growth hurts tax revenues and, in turn, forces government cuts. This doesn’t mean that Granholm’s point is inaccurate, but in trying to apply a state lesson to a federal problem, she’s ignored a key factor in how state fiscal policy works. On balance, we rate her statement Mostly True.	None	Jennifer Granholm	None	None	None	2011-08-04T16:04:47	2011-07-31	['Michigan']
pomt-10691	"The oddest thing is he doesn't want to do for America what he did for Massachusetts. He did mandate health care for Massachusetts, which is HillaryCare, and he doesn't want to do that for America."	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2007/dec/10/rudy-giuliani/romney-wants-a-different-prescription-for-the-nati/	There are several pieces to this, so we'll take them one at a time. First, Massachusetts: As governor, Mitt Romney oversaw a major rewrite of the state's health care program in 2006 that featured a mandate on individuals. Everyone in the state must enroll in a plan or face tax penalties. It's true that Romney vetoed the teeth behind part of the mandate — a charge to companies that didn't offer coverage to employees — which was later overridden by the state Legislature. So, Giuliani is correct that Romney enacted a "mandate" plan, though Romney has sought to avoid that term. Giuliani also is correct that the program in Massachusetts shares some things with the health care proposal put forward by Sen. Hillary Clinton. Both expand upon the current private-public system. Neither forces changes for those who like their current employer-provided insurance. Both aim to provide coverage for all, with subsidized private plans. And both mandate coverage by penalizing those who can afford to buy a plan but don't. Now, does that mean the Massachusetts program is "HillaryCare"? We'll take a pass on judging that one. Giuliani's other point is that Romney isn't proposing a national plan similar to what he did in Massachusetts. That's true, too. Romney has argued that population demographics vary so much by state that a universal plan can't be applied across the country. Instead, he has proposed changing the way federal dollars are made available to states — which is what Massachusetts was able to do — so states are free to draw up plans that suit themselves. Add it all up and Giuliani's got it right.	None	Rudy Giuliani	None	None	None	2007-12-10T00:00:00	2007-11-26	['United_States', 'Massachusetts', 'Clinton_health_care_plan_of_1993']
pomt-05659	By the time Obama took office, "The Bush administration had given the car companies $13 billion and the money was now gone."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/mar/19/barack-obama/obama-campaign-movie-says-auto-bailout-money-had-r/	In a new 17-minute campaign movie highlighting President Barack Obama’s accomplishments in office, narrator Tom Hanks walks viewers through the major challenges of the last four years and how the president has handled them. Osama bin Laden. Iraq. Health care. The collapsing auto industry. On the subject of Detroit, car company CEOs appear onscreen asking for money in Washington, followed by pictures of empty factories and dire news headlines. The movie talks about the financial pressures on the new president and the unpopularity with the public of more bailouts. But Obama, Hanks says, acted anyway to help American workers. "He decided to intervene, but in exchange for help the president would demand action. The Bush administration had given the car companies $13 billion, and the money was now gone," Hanks says. Then President Bill Clinton appears onscreen to lend his voice. "He didn’t just give the car companies the money, and he didn’t give the UAW the money," Clinton says. "He said you guys gotta work together and come up, and everybody’s gotta have some skin in the game here. You gotta modernize the automobile industry." Chrysler and GM got their first billions in December 2008 under President George W. Bush and received billions more under Obama. So here, we’re checking the movie’s claim that the first round of loans ran out before the second was extended -- that when Obama took office "the Bush administration had given the car companies $13 billion, and the money was now gone." Bailout primer In early December 2008, Chrysler and GM were dangerously close to collapsing. With global credit markets frozen, the companies turned to the federal government for an emergency infusion of money. More than a million jobs were at stake. Bush authorized initial loans to Chrysler and GM (and their respective financing arms) before leaving office, using money from the Troubled Asset Relief Program. Chrysler initially received $4 billion, and GM got $13.4 billion in bridge loans meant to keep the companies afloat for a little longer. Early in 2009, Obama convened a task force to study the companies’ viability. Both were required to submit plans for getting back to solvency, but both failed, the task force determined. In the meantime, they were running short of money again. A report from the Congressional Oversight Panel details the chronology of the spending, including an additional $6.36 billion that GM received between March and May 2009. Both companies ended up going through structured bankruptcies, Chrysler in April and GM in June. The Obama administration was instrumental in the manner in which the reorganizations proceeded. Some debt holders were forced to take losses, while the autoworkers union health care trust, which was owed billions in health benefits, took an equity stake, as did the federal government. Details on the money The Obama campaign responded to our inquiry with citations of several news stories about when the first loans were disbursed. * $5 billion to financing arm GMAC on Dec. 29, 2008 * $4 billion to GM on Dec. 31, 2008 * $4 billion to Chrysler on Jan. 2, 2009 * $884 million to GMAC on Jan. 16, 2009 * $100 million to financing arm Chrysler Financial on Jan. 16, 2009 Obama was inaugurated Jan. 20, 2009. So that adds up to almost $14 billion in auto bailout money before he took office. Details on the spending The campaign also sent us reports from early 2009 on where the money was going. Sean McAlinden, chief economist for the Center for Automotive Research, told the Detroit News in January that "GM and Chrysler are insolvent. Without federal funding they are bankrupt." He added that Chysler needed $6 billion at the time to pay its suppliers for the previous quarter's auto parts, and he said he suspected the full $4 billion loan went towards those payments, the story said. (We reached out to McAlinden for our story but didn’t hear back.) A Detroit Free Press story noted that GM was spending $7.5 billion per month on car parts at the time the government bailed it out. The Obama campaign pointed out that just a single month’s expenses exceeded the amount GM received from the Treasury by $3.5 billion. ABC News published a story in April 2009 quoting Neil Barofsky, the TARP inspector general, saying that Chrysler Financial had asked for more funds because "they had basically used up the $1.5 billion that was lent to them." Some context We ran this statement by Steven Rattner, who headed Obama’s task force through the bailouts. He said it’s accurate that the funds were exhausted. "It got used up before we really were in the saddle," he said. But he also pointed out that none of the parties involved -- not the Bush administration, the incoming Obama administration or the car companies -- thought it would be enough to bring the automakers back to solvency. "Nobody thought it was going to solve the problem. This was a interim financing," Rattner said. "This was all something we anticipated." A New York Times story from the time said the Bush loan "gives the companies a few months to get their businesses in order but hands off to President-elect Barack Obama the difficult political task of ruling on their future." We also think it’s worth mentioning the implication in the video that the Bush administration did not put enough restrictions on the money. "He decided to intervene, but in exchange for help the president would demand action," narrator Hanks says just before mentioning the Bush loans. Obama himself has previously said the Bush team handed out billions and asked nothing in return, a statement we rated False. Keith Hennessey, a former Bush administration official, wrote on his blog in June 2009 about the many restrictions tied to the loans, including that the car companies pay down debt, limits on executive compensation and negotiated reductions in wages and benefits for autoworkers. And remember the companies’ viability plans reviewed by Obama’s task force? They were required under the terms of the Bush loans. Our ruling The Obama campaign movie says, "the Bush administration had given the car companies $13 billion and the money was now gone." It's important to note that the $13 billion was provided as loans, not as grants, as the wording might suggest. Referring to the time Obama took office, January 2009, GM and Chrysler by then had received almost $14 billion in bailout money. News reports also reflect that the money was basically used up. So, that much is correct. But the movie ignores the fact that this was not unexpected. The Bush administration’s loans were always just a temporary lifeline, meant to keep the companies operating so the new president would have time to decide what to do long term. This is important information left out of the movie’s extensive discussion of the auto bailouts. That the $13 billion was gone when Obama arrived was no surprise. We rate the statement Mostly True.

pomt-13079	"I was the first member of Congress to contribute to Donald Trump."	true	/texas/statements/2016/nov/11/lamar-smith/lamar-smith-first-member-Congress-donate-Trump-Don/	A re-elected U.S. House member from Texas offered congratulations to Donald Trump while laying claim to a financial first with the Republican president-elect. U.S. Rep. Lamar Smith, R-San Antonio, said in a Nov. 9, 2016, web post that voters chose a president who won’t expand government control. "They have rejected bad trade deals, open borders, heavy-handed regulations, Obamacare, a liberal Supreme Court, political correctness, and business as usual in Washington," Smith wrote. Smith went on: "When I learned I was the first member of Congress to contribute to Donald Trump, I didn't know whether to smile or frown. Now I realize that few actions have given me as much satisfaction. The walk-on quarterback has won the Super Bowl!" Smith, who chairs the House Committee on Science & Technology, joined several fellow Republican House committee chairs in endorsing Trump’s candidacy on May 14, 2016. Was he also the first member of Congress to make a contribution to the New York businessman? Smith reported donations starting in May 2016 We emailed Smith consultant Jordan Berry seeking Smith’s factual backup. Then we called the Federal Election Commission, repository for candidate finance reports, where Julia Queen helped us ascertain that Smith’s campaign committee, Texans for Lamar Smith, reported giving the Donald J. Trump for President committee $2,000 on May 27, 2016. Our searches of FEC-posted summaries of Trump’s campaign finance filings show too that Trump reported fielding $1,913 from Smith’s campaign on Oct. 5, 2016. Trump’s campaign also listed $5,000 received Oct. 5, 2016, from the Maryland-based Longhorn PAC, a "leadership PAC" affiliated with Smith, according to a PAC filing with the FEC. Trump’s finance report also states "excess to be refunded" from the $5,000, without elaboration. Our request for research help from the Center for Responsive Politics, which tracks campaign contributions and spending, drew an email from spokeswoman Viveca Novak noting the Smith-led Longhorn PAC earlier reported giving Trump’s campaign $3,000 on May 27, 2016 According to the FEC-posted summary of the Longhorn PAC’s donations to campaigns, the group also gave $1,000 on June 14, 2016 to a Massachusetts-based Trump Victory group. Even earlier, the Smith-steered group donated $5,000 in May 2015 to Texas Sen. Ted Cruz’s presidential campaign. All told then, Smith’s campaign and his Longhorn PAC reported making three Trump campaign donations totaling $6,000 from May 27, 2016 into October 2016. Trump’s campaign reported $6,913 in two Smith-connected contributions in October 2016. A wrinkle: The contributions reported by Smith didn’t show up in the FEC-posted summaries of Trump’s reports, far as we could tell, nor did some of what Trump reported getting from Smith’s committee or leadership PAC appear in Smith’s filings. Significantly, though, Berry told us by email that Smith’s records show the May 2016 Smith campaign committee and leadership PAC checks made out to the Trump campaign were each cashed in mid-June 2016. Other members of Congress? So, how about other members of Congress ponying up for Trump? Our review of Trump’s FEC list of other campaigns giving to his effort didn’t turn up other House members making donations prior to July 2016. Starting that month, five other Republican House members made donations from respective campaign funds. Listed among more than 60 contributions from other political committees reported by Trump up to Oct. 18, 2016: --The Lone Star Leadership PAC, affiliated with Texas Rep. Michael Burgess, R-Flower Mound, gave two donations totaling $10,000 on July 21, 2016, the same day Burgess’ campaign gave two donations totaling $4,000. --A $2,000 donation from Rep. Ken Calvert of California on Sept. 9, 2016. --Rep. Steve Scalise of Louisiana donated $2,000 on Sept. 26, 2016. --Rep. Mark Meadows of North Carolina gave $1,994 in multiple in-kind donations in October 2016. --Rep. Tom McClintock of California gave $2,000 on Oct. 5, 2016. Trump’s campaign otherwise reported that a former House member, Dan Burton of Indiana, made two contributions totaling $2,700 in July 2016 and Todd Wilcox, a former Florida U.S. Senate aspirant, donated $2,000 in October 2016. The center’s Daniel Auble said by email that for candidate committees and leadership PACs, Smith was the first sitting member of Congress to contribute to Trump’s bid. But in 2017, Smith will be sworn in with a new member of Congress who gave even earlier to Trump. Paul Mitchell, a Michigan Republican, made a $292 in-kind donation to Trump’s campaign in February 2016, Auble said. No personal donations by Smith We also explored whether Smith put personal money, not campaign funds, into Trump’s cause. Our search on the FEC website for Trump donors whose names include "Lamar" didn’t reveal personal Lamar Smith contributions to the presidential hopeful. Across Texas, according to the FEC, Trump’s campaign reported accepting 135 contributions totaling $45,253 from September 2015 through Oct. 19, 2016. Those donors in 2016 included three San Antonio Smiths, Trump’s committee reported, none named Lamar. And did other House members make personal donations to Trump before Smith’s campaign chipped in? We didn't close in on this ourselves but Auble said his "quick scan" of individual donations posted by the FEC didn’t turn up anyone. Our ruling Smith said: "I was the first member of Congress to contribute to" Trump for president. Corroborating records appear to be imperfect. But Smith reported contributions to the Trump cause in May 2016 and we didn’t find any sign of other members of Congress donating to Trump before July 2016. We rate this statement True.

pomt-08214	The Florida Supreme Court has "no express authority in the Florida Constitution" to remove questions from the ballot proposed by the Legislature.	mostly false	/florida/statements/2010/nov/18/dean-cannon/dean-cannon-says-state-supreme-court-lacks-express/	In 2010, the Florida Supreme Court removed three proposed constitutional amendments from the Nov. 2 ballot. Florida House Speaker Dean Cannon, R-Winter Park, a lawyer, bashed the court for doing so on Nov. 16, 2010, in his first speech as House speaker during the Legislature's one-day organizing session. "As an attorney and an officer of the court, I believe fervently in a judicial branch that is strong and independent and fully empowered and equipped to fulfill its constitutional duties. But for the judiciary to be independent, it must also be impartial and apolitical. It must respect the co-equal executive and legislative branches, and it must protect their unambiguous constitutional powers, and it must practice the restraint that is built into our federal and state constitutions. And yet, over the past year three times we saw the work of a three-fifths super majority of this legislative branch, the elected representatives of over 18 million Floridians, demolished by five unelected justices of the Florida Supreme Court. This was done notwithstanding the fact that there is no express authority in the Florida Constitution for their doing so." For this Truth-O-Meter we will explore, is there "no express authority in the Florida Constitution" for the state Supreme Court to remove amendments placed on the ballot by the Legislature? First, some background on the amendments in question that we gleaned from a Sept. 1, 2010, article in the Miami Herald/St. Petersburg Times. In a 5-2 ruling on Aug. 31, 2010, the Supreme Court struck three amendments from the November 2010 ballot: • Amendment 3: To grant extra tax breaks to first-time home-buyers. • Amendment 7: To "clarify" redistricting Amendments 5 and 6, which did remain on the ballot. • Amendment 9: To prohibit Florida from participating in a health insurance exchange that forces people to buy insurance, which was in reaction to the new federal health care law. First, we asked Cannon spokesperson Katherine Betta to provide proof that the Florida Supreme Court lacks "express authority" in the state Constitution to remove the ballot items. "He has the text of the Constitution… express authority means authority that is expressly written into the Constitution,'' Betta wrote in an e-mail. "The Constitution doesn’t provide express authority for the judicial branch to remove amendments placed on the ballot by the Legislature. It only provides authority to remove those placed by citizen petition." These three ballot items were placed on the ballot by the Legislature, she wrote. We sent Cannon's claim to four professors who are experts in Florida constitutional law -- Joseph Little, Timothy McLendon and Jon Mills at the University of Florida and Donald Jones at the University of Miami. We also interviewed three lawyers who have argued amendment cases in Florida: Mark Herron, Barry Richard and Ronald Meyer. Most of the legal experts agreed that there is no "express authority" in the state Constitution -- no blunt, direct language that says the Supreme Court should review ballot items written by the Legislature. But most also said that doesn't matter. The Supreme Court clearly has jurisdiction, and it would be misleading to suggest otherwise. First, let's look at the legal documents that the professors cited -- the Florida Constitution and state statute 101.161. The state Constitution in Article 4 Section 10 expressly directs the Supreme Court to review amendments headed to the ballot that were written by citizens -- not the Legislature: "The attorney general shall, as directed by general law, request the opinion of the justices of the supreme court as to the validity of any initiative petition circulated pursuant to Section 3 of Article XI. The justices shall, subject to their rules of procedure, permit interested persons to be heard on the questions presented and shall render their written opinion no later than April 1 of the year in which the initiative is to be submitted to the voters pursuant to Section 5 of Article XI." But the Constitution in Article 11 Section 1, also allows the state Legislature -- by a three-fifths vote -- to put an amendment on a ballot. That section makes no mention of the Supreme Court. "There is a distinct difference between citizen petitions and the Legislature’s express constitutional authority to place amendments before the people," Betta wrote. "The Constitution does not provide express authority for courts to remove questions placed on the ballot by the Legislature, as Rep. Cannon discussed in his speech." That's what Mills concluded about Cannon's claim: "I think he is right. The only provision in the Constitution dealing with judicial review relates to (citizen) initiatives." But the Supreme Court still has authority to review such legislative-proposed amendments. After the Legislature agrees to place a question on the ballot, someone can file a challenge at the trial court level, which can work its way to the appeals court and then the state Supreme Court. That's what happened in the case of the three legislative amendments in 2010. Several lawyers said the basis on which the Florida Supreme Court removed the Legislature's proposed amendments in 2010 was state law 101.161, which requires that such amendments be "printed in clear and unambiguous language" among other requirements. That statute doesn't directly state that the Supreme Court can review amendments for that purpose, but the lawyers said it doesn't have to -- individual statutes don't have to mention the court's jurisdiction. Meyer told us in an e-mail that the Supreme Court has the jurisdiction to review such a decision due to Article 5 Section 3 of the Constitution, which states that the Supreme Court: "may review any order or judgment of a trial court certified by the district court of appeal in which an appeal is pending to be of great public importance, or to have a great effect on the proper administration of justice throughout the state, and certified to require immediate resolution by the Supreme Court." Meyer also wrote: "For nearly a century, the Florida Supreme Court has exercised its constitutional power to review proposed amendments." Here is the full text of what Meyer wrote to us. "You could say there is nothing red in the sky that allows the Supreme Court" to review amendments, and that would also be true, Meyer said sarcastically in an interview. Richard, who has argued several amendment cases, said technically he agrees with Cannon that the Constitution lacks express authority for the Supreme Court, but the court can review amendments if a lawsuit is filed at the trial court. (It bears repeating: That's exactly what happened with these three amendments that angered Cannon.) "Most Supreme Court authority isn't spelled out,'' Richard said. "If you say that it has to be 'express authority' then the Supreme Court wouldn't be able to review any statutory provisions. You need to take the next step. He is correct that there is no express authority, I agree, but most of the authority of the Supreme Court isn't express -- it is inherent in its nature as the high court in this state." We also sent Cannon's claim to the Florida Attorney General's office, which sometimes represents the Legislature in amendment challenges. Spokeswoman Sandi Copes sent back a link to the the 2000 Armstrong decision, which tossed out a death penalty amendment due to misleading ballot language after it was approved by voters in 1998. That ruling included this statement: "Although the Constitution does not expressly authorize judicial review of amendments proposed by the Legislature, this Court long ago explained that the courts are the proper forum in which to litigate the validity of such amendments." Let's look at what two professors wrote to us in e-mails: "The Florida courts possess jurisdiction, upon proper complaint having been filed, to ascertain whether the Legislature’s prescribed standards have been satisfied," Little wrote. "The statute does not exempt proposals adopted by the Legislature from review. Hence, although it is true that the Florida Constitution does not include express language on this point, it is well within the Supreme Court’s jurisdiction to review the questions of law that arise under (state law.)" The state Constitution, Little wrote, "does not have express words pertaining to most of the other myriad issues the court considers. By contrast, the Supreme Court does have express authority to review constitutional amendments proposed by citizen initiatives. I do not disagree that the authority is not 'express.' I do disagree that the Supreme Court lacks jurisdiction." And Jones wrote: "The law is not always what is written down. What is express or written down can never be the limit of the law in a democracy. If that were so, most of the law of the 20th century including Brown v. Board of Education would be void." (That's a reference to the landmark 1954 U.S. Supreme Court school desegregation case.) Let's summarize: There is no sentence in the Florida Constitution that bluntly states, as UF's McLendon told us, "Oh by the way the Supreme Court can review these amendments and kick them off the ballot.'' So technically, Cannon is correct that there is "no express authority" in the Constitution. But let's look at the context of Cannon's remarks: "And yet, over the past year three times we saw the work of a three-fifths super majority of this legislative branch, the elected representatives of over 18 million Floridians, demolished by five unelected Justices of the Florida Supreme Court. This was done notwithstanding the fact that there is no express authority in the Florida constitution for their doing so." Cannon is clearly raising questions about whether the Supreme Court overstepped its bounds here, implying that it lacked authority for its action and that it failed to respect the legislative branch. The legal scholars and lawyers we interviewed agreed that the Supreme Court does have jurisdiction to review those amendments. Or to put it in non-legal terms, big whoop that it lacks "express authority" in the Constitution -- the Supremes have every right to rule here. We rate this claim Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.

pomt-04303	Says he "opposed $716 billion cut to Medicare."	half-true	/florida/statements/2012/oct/30/cw-bill-young/bill-young-says-he-opposed-716-billion-medicare-cu/	U.S. Rep. C.W. Bill Young, the Indian Shores Republican incumbent of 42 years, touts his credibility with seniors in a TV spot clearly aimed at the 65-plus crowd. An ensemble of older men and women, and even former Gov. Jeb Bush, praise Young for being there for seniors. "Florida seniors couldn’t have a bigger champion than Congressman Bill Young," Bush says. Amid the endorsements are claims about Young’s record on Social Security, the Medicare prescription drug program, support for a balanced budget amendment, and, of course, Medicare. "Young opposed $716-billion cut to Medicare," bold text shows. Below that text is a citation: "House Roll Call Vote 165 - 3/21/2010." It’s the House vote on the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, which Young voted against. Does that mean he rejected "the $716 billion cut to Medicare?" We also checked a dueling Medicare claim from his challenger, Democratic lawyer Jessica Ehrlich, over whether he voted for the Ryan budgets that "end the current Medicare system." The $716 billion cut You could say we’ve heard this line a time or two. This attack line is a viral one in the political world, used by Mitt Romney against President Barack Obama, Rep. Connie Mack against Sen. Bill Nelson, and in many, many, many other races across the country. It’s not a "cut" in the traditional sense. Medicare is an open-ended entitlement program with a growth problem that threatens its future viability. Both parties agree changes should be made. Obama did not propose a cut to Medicare’s budget in his health care law. Rather, the law made several changes to slow the growth of Medicare costs. These changes primarily affected insurance companies and hospitals -- not beneficiaries. The government, for example, will pay hospitals less if they have too many readmissions or fail to meet new benchmarks for care. The law also deals with Medicare Advantage, which is a subset of Medicare plans run by private insurers started under President George W. Bush with the goal of reducing costs through marketplace competition. The plans have actually proven more expensive than traditional Medicare in recent years, so the health care law aims to reduce payments to private insurers as a way to rein in costs. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office determined in 2011 that the federal health care law would reduce Medicare outlays by $507 billion between 2012 and 2021. In a more recent estimate released this year, the CBO looked at the years 2013 to 2022 and determined the health care law affected Medicare outlays by $716 billion. It’s worth pointing out Young could not have known he was specifically voting against $716 billion in Medicare "cuts," as that had not been tabulated in time for the health care vote that happened two years earlier. Still, it was known at the bill’s passage that there were major reductions in store for Medicare service providers, said economist Gail Wilensky, senior fellow at the international health foundation Project HOPE and Medicare director under President George H.W. Bush. A tricky point for Young’s claim is that he also voted for the budget blueprint of Rep. Paul Ryan, R-Wis. -- twice, actually. The budget is a congressional resolution that does not carry the force of law, and Ryan’s ideas have not been turned into detailed legislation. Even so, Ryan has said his most recent budget factors in the same $716 billion in reductions in Medicare spending. Obama campaign spokeswoman Stephanie Cutter made this point on Face the Nation in August, saying Ryan "protected those cuts in his budget." PolitiFact rated her statement True. The Romney campaign responded to Cutter’s remark with a statement that Romney intended to repeal the health care law and end the Medicare "raid." Ryan said he factored the $716 billion savings in his budget it "was already in the baseline," the Wall Street Journal reported. "We would never have done it in the first place." However, his budget assumed reversal of other Obama spending decisions, the Journal pointed out. A month later, former President Bill Clinton reprised the attack in his Democratic National Convention speech, quipping, "it takes some brass to attack a guy for doing what you did." We rated it True. Ehrlich’s position Ehrlich is in an interesting spot here. She, too, opposes this "cut." Even though she supports the health care law, she told the Tampa Bay Times, "I am against the $500 billion cuts to Medicare in both the Affordable Care Act and the Ryan budget. I also oppose the Independent Panel Advisory Board in the Affordable Care Act and would support legislation to overturn that provision." She has attacked Young for voting for the Ryan budgets that reshape how Medicare works. When we asked her to elaborate on her position in an interview, she said she wanted to keep Medicare "fully funded." "I think we have to maintain the integrity of the program, make sure that it’s fully funded, and not advocate for cutting until we look at the budget as a whole," she said. She did not provide specifics for reducing the program’s spending. Young said she could not have had it both ways if she were a member of Congress at the time of the vote. "If you voted for the bill, you voted for the Medicare cut," he said. Our ruling Young’s ad says he voted against the controversial $716 billion Medicare cut. What he voted against was the Affordable Care Act, which implements an estimated $716 billion reduction in payments to hospitals and private insurers in effort to reduce the program’s ever-increasing costs. He could not have known the amount would be $716 billion, as that estimate came two years after the health care vote. Meanwhile, the Republicans have their own plan for reducing future Medicare spending, by bring more private insurance companies into Medicare and offering voucher-like premium support. The claim excludes several points. We rate it Half True.	None	C.W. Bill Young	None	None	None	2012-10-30T18:59:24	2012-10-17	['None']
pomt-05686	President Barack Obama’s policies have forced "many parts of the country to experience rolling blackouts."	pants on fire!	/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/mar/13/rick-santorum/rick-santorum-says-many-parts-country-experience-r/	On March 10, 2012, Rick Santorum published an op-ed on his website titled, "Why Energy Policy Matters to Americans." In it, he took a series of shots at President Barack Obama’s energy policies. "This president’s agenda doesn’t just stop with oil and gas," Santorum wrote. "President Obama has also discouraged new electricity generation -- forcing many parts of the country to experience rolling blackouts. That means that millions of Americans will live with a power grid that is second-rate, like a Third World country." We hadn't noticed the lights cycling off, so we wondered: Are many parts of the country really experiencing "rolling blackouts"? Before we go any further, let's define our terms. A "rolling blackout" occurs when a utility intentionally "shuts off the power to an area, turns it back on, and then shuts the power off in a different area," with outages in any given area typically lasting 60 to 90 minutes, according to the California Energy Commission. A utility would do this as a last resort, in order to avoid an even worse situation -- a total power blackout. A rolling blackout is distinct from two other electrical problems. Brownouts are temporary reductions in current, intentional or unintentional, which may or may not be noticeable to a customer. An uncontrolled outage occurs when power is disrupted without warning, often by weather or accidents. Rolling blackouts typically occur during 3 to 7 p.m., hours of peak use, when demand for electricity begins to exceed the local utility's available supply, the commission explained. "These controlled or planned blackouts help prevent ‘uncontrolled’ electrical power outages during the peak periods, which assures your electricity supply remains continuous and with minimal interruptions." Typically, utilities will try to forestall rolling blackouts by first issuing calls for customers to limit their power use and then by activating a system under which certain customers have agreed to limit their power uptake on high-demand days. So how often do rolling blackouts occur today? The Santorum campaign didn’t get back to us, but from what we can tell, it’s not all that often. We found data from Eaton Corp., a private power management company that publishes an annual "Blackout Tracker." (It can be downloaded here, free with registration.) Overall, in 2011 Eaton counted 3,071 power outages affecting 41.8 million Americans. That’s a modest decrease in outages from the previous year, but a big increase in the number of Americans affected; in 2010, 17.5 million Americans were affected. The difference is partly due to Hurricane Irene, which cut power to 6 million people, following two relatively quiet years for hurricanes. Weather is the principal cause of power outages in the U.S., according to Eaton. Here's the company's breakdown of what caused blackouts in 2011, where causes could be determined: Weather: 1,229 Faulty equipment or human error: 767 Vehicle accident: 245 Animal: 208 Planned: 138 Theft or vandalism: 28 Rolling blackouts would be "planned" outages, so at most, just 5 percent of these power outages might have been rolling blackouts. For comparison, that’s about as many power outages as were caused by squirrels in 2011. Really. Eaton tracked that in another chart. A range of experts we spoke to said they knew of no epidemic of rolling blackouts in the United States in recent years. "The Electric Power Research Institute is not aware of any rolling blackouts cascading throughout the country," said Clay Perry, the senior media relations manager for EPRI, a research group on the generation, delivery and use of electricity. "Do share if you can find any." As for Santorum's suggestion that Obama is to blame for the non-existent widespread rolling blackouts, it’s worth noting the limits of Obama’s power on the electric power supply. While Obama has pushed for improvements to the electrical grid, "political decisions about power generation and distribution are largely a state regulatory matter," with additional roles played by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, which is an independent federal agency, and various regional grid reliability councils, said Stephen Brown, a fellow with Resources for the Future and adjunct professor in energy management at the University of Colorado. There was at least one high-profile case of rolling blackouts in 2011 -- in early February in Texas, when the state, shivering in an unusual cold snap, imposed rolling blackouts for just the second time in more than two decades. The blackouts "left nearly 1 million homes dark and without heat for up to an hour, caused some schools and businesses to shut and spurred traffic snarls as some traffic lights stopped working," Reuters reported. According to the Houston Chronicle, Trip Doggett, the CEO of the state's main grid operator, the Electric Reliability Council of Texas, said the rolling blackouts were not caused by a failure to predict demand accurately or to keep enough plants online but by a widespread mechanical failure of more than 50 power generating units across the state. There was no single reason for the failures and no particular location, plant operator or type of power plant behind the problem, Doggett said. Critics of Obama seized on the Texas rolling blackouts as evidence that the president’s policies were endangering the nation’s energy future. The impact of Obama’s policies on energy supplies is a topic of heated disagreement, but that’s not what we're checking here. Rather, we’re checking whether such policies are already "forcing many parts of the country to experience rolling blackouts" -- and the data and expert opinions don't back that up. Our ruling Santorum’s said that Obama’s policies have forced "many parts of the country to experience rolling blackouts" -- evoking images of Third World countries.

pomt-00669	"Ben Carson is running for president to ‘eliminate dependency on government.’ But he doesn’t mention that he grew up in public schools, got public housing and food stamps, got free glasses from a government program, was helped by Affirmative Action, and got Pell Grants for college."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/may/11/occupy-democrats/does-ben-carson-want-eliminate-dependency-governme/	With Ben Carson officially in the ring of Republican presidential contenders, Democratic social media activists are using his famous scraps-to-scalpel narrative against him. Carson, 63, was raised in a single-parent, impoverished household in Detroit and went on to become a Yale University-educated neurosurgeon at Johns Hopkins Hospital. Carson, in 1987, was the first doctor to separate twins conjoined at the head. The Facebook group Occupy Democrats accuses Carson of wanting to take away some of the very same government benefits that helped support Carson’s family. The Facebook meme shared May 4, 2015, says, "Tea party icon Dr. Ben Carson is running for president to ‘eliminate dependency on government.’ " "But he doesn’t mention that he grew up in public schools, got public housing and food stamps, got free glasses from a government program, was helped by Affirmative Action, and got Pell Grants for college. "Hypocrisy, much?" A reader asked us to look into Carson’s biography and see if the facts align with the meme’s claims. The meme is rather thinly sourced to a blogpost that links back to another post that links to another post (as memes do). So we’ll deal with the claims line by line. ‘Grew up in public schools’ This checks out. Raised by a single mother with a third-grade education, Carson grew up very poor and attended public schools in Detroit, including Higgins Elementary School, Wilson Junior High School, Hunter Junior High School and Southwestern High School, where he graduated third in his class. In his 1990 autobiography Gifted Hands, Carson describes how he briefly attended fourth grade at a small private church school when his mother, Sonya, moved him and his older brother, Curtis, to live with relatives in Boston after the Carsons’ father moved out. His mother thought the boys would get a better education there than at the public schools. She was wrong. "Though Curtis and I both made good grades, the work was not as demanding as it could have been, and when we transferred back to the Detroit public school system I had quite a shock," Carson wrote. ‘Got public housing’ The details here are a little thin. When Carson’s mother divorced his father, she received their "modest house" in the settlement. Carson described it as the size of most modern garages, less than 1,000 square feet. But as the family’s financial situation deteriorated, they were forced to "move into the Boston tenements" with his aunt and uncle. It seems likely from his words that the tenements were for very poor families likely receiving government assistance, perhaps even for the homes. Carson describes "armies of roaches," "hordes of rats" and omnipresent "winos and drunks." When Sonya Carson saved enough to move back to Detroit, the family moved into a multifamily dwelling in Detroit in an "upper lower-class neighborhood," he wrote. Carson doesn’t outright describe the houses as Section 8 or federally funded projects. Other examinations of his life have, such as a Success.com article that described this second Detroit home as in "Detroit’s downtown housing projects" and "the ghetto." Eventually his mother saved enough to return to the Carsons’ original home in a better neighborhood. Got ‘food stamps’ This claim checks out. In his autobiography, Carson recounted the humiliation he felt using food stamps from his mom to pay for bread and milk. He would hide from classmates in the grocery store until it was safe to check out unnoticed. As hard as his mother worked in various domestic jobs, it wasn’t enough to keep the family completely off of public assistance, he wrote. "By the time I went into ninth grade, Mother had made such strides that she received nothing except food stamps," he wrote. "She couldn't have provided for us and kept up the house without that subsidy." ‘Got free glasses from a government program’ This, too, is correct. An eye exam in the fifth grade proved life-changing for Carson. In the fourth chapter of Gifted Hands, he says it wasn’t until he failed to read letters on a chart on the wall that he realized his eyesight had deteriorated over time, contributing in part to his struggles at school. "The school provided glasses for me, free," he wrote. Carson counts his glasses as a significant reason for his improvement in school because he could finally see the chalkboard. ‘Was helped by affirmative action’ This claim is unproven. Carson wanted to go out of state for college, even though the University of Michigan in his home state "actively recruited black students" and was willing to waive application fees for low-income students, he wrote. He narrowed his sights on either Harvard or Yale, and decided to go with Yale after an impressive win against Harvard on College Bowl on TV. He started classes at Yale in 1969 and received a 90 percent scholarship, he wrote. Were affirmative action policies to thank for his admission? Carson’s resume was impressive — he was third in his class, advanced so high within ROTC that he was offered a scholarship to West Point, and had high test scores. Still, Carson says he knew his minority background was valuable, saying "most of the top colleges were scrambling to enroll Blacks." "The school reps flocked around me because of my high academic achievements, and because I had done exceptionally well on the Scholastic Aptitude Test (SAT), ranking somewhere in the low ninetieth percentile--again, unheard of from a student in the inner city of Detroit," he wrote. After graduating from Yale with a degree in psychology, Carson was accepted into the University of Michigan Medical School, which he chose because it was in his home state, meaning lower tuition, and it was highly rated. In 1976, he applied for his residency in neurosurgery at Johns Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore, which he said took only two interns a year. The school chose Carson, who said he made an impression on his interviewer by sharing a love for classical music. "Years later Dr. Udvarhelyi told me that he had made a strong case for my being accepted to Dr. Long, the chairman," he wrote. " ‘Ben,’ he said to me, ‘I was impressed with your grades, your honors and recommendations, and the splendid way you handled yourself in the interview.’ " Carson remained convinced that their exchange over a classical music concert gave him an edge. He did not, however, mention his race. ‘Got Pell grants for college’ This claim, too, is unproven and in many ways the weakest claim tracing Carson’s life story. Carson definitely received financial assistance to pay for college, but he does not offer details about the grants, at least not in Gifted Hands or to reporters in the last two decades. He also worked during the summers to help pay for other costs during school. The only mention of "Ben Carson" and "Pell Grants" in a LexisNexis search is in the context of his criticism of Obama’s proposal to offer free community college. "First of all, it is only free if no one has to pay for it. It is not free if we rob Peter to pay Paul," Carson wrote in a February column. "Secondly, Pell grants already exist to pay for community college expenses for needy students. For those who are not needy, there is an old-fashioned remedy that is very effective called work. In fact work might even be beneficial for those who are needy. It certainly provided some very valuable experiences for me." The article the meme holds up as support for its claims references a since-deleted post from a Facebook user who said Carson "benefited from affirmative action to enter college; used federal loans and Pell grants in undergrad school; benefited from affirmative action to enter medical school," and "med school paid for with grant from USPHS." We contacted the author about where he got this information via Facebook. We’ll update the story if anything becomes of it. Comparing Carson’s life story and his political platform The meme, of course, is trying to accomplish more than just recounting Carson’s biography. It’s also suggesting Carson would end many of the programs he benefited from growing up. That is the most difficult allegation to prove of all. Carson directly addressed this criticism May 4, 2015, the day he announced his run for president. "Many people are critical of me because they say, ‘Carson wants to get rid of all the safety nets and welfare programs even though he must have benefited from them,’ " he said, according to a Politico account. "This is a blatant lie. I have no desire to get rid of safety nets for people who need them. I have a strong desire to get rid of programs that create dependency in able-bodied people." This is similar to his response to a question about how he would get his message to minority voters at February’s 2015 Conservative Political Action Conference. "I’m not interested in getting rid of the safety net," he said. "I’m interested in getting rid of dependency, and I want us to find a way to allow people to excel in our society, and as more and more people hear that message, they will recognize who is truly on their side and who is trying to keep them suppressed and cultivate their votes." Carson’s campaign website does not mention specific reforms to the safety net, but his rhetoric indicates he indeed wants to eliminate government dependency. What’s not clear is if that would involve axing the same programs that helped his family get by decades ago. For the record, we could not locate the exact quote referenced in the meme "Eliminate dependency on government," though that language wouldn’t be out of character for Carson. Carson spokeswoman Deana Bass said Carson’s "family did receive benefits briefly when he was growing up in Detroit," but didn’t answer our specific questions about whether he used Pell grants or grew up in public housing. Our ruling A popular liberal Facebook meme aims to hold up Carson’s past reliance on public assistance against him as he calls for eliminating government dependence in high-profile speeches. The meme gets many details of Carson’s biography right, though it also jumps to some conclusions in a few places. More complicated is the comparison between Carson’s past and his plans if elected president. Carson has said he wants to eliminate government dependency, but he also has made clear he intends to maintain programs public safety nets for people who need them. Carson hasn’t elaborated what programs fall into what category, and how those he benefited from would be treated. Overall, the meme is partially accurate but leaves out important details and takes things out of context. We rate it Half True.

pomt-09984	On torture.	half flip	/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/apr/28/newt-gingrich/gingrich-has-moderated-tone-torture/	When we hear charges of "most bitter hypocrisy," we know it's time to pull out our Flip-O-Meter. Such was the case when we saw MSNBC host Keith Olbermann attacking Newt Gingrich, a Republican who was House speaker in the 1990s. "Imagine being Newt Gingrich and looking into that mirror this morning and seeing that vast terrain of hypocrisy looking right back at you," Olbermann said on April 27, 2009. At issue: Gingrich's comments on torture. Olbermann said Gingrich was being hypocritical because his 2009 comments on interrogations conducted by the United States on terrorist extremists were not consistent with his comments from 1997 on torture in China. Gingrich then: In 1997, Gingrich was House speaker when Chinese President Jiang Zemin visited the United States. Gingrich was concerned about the persecution of religious minorities in China, and broached the topic in a meeting with Jiang. He then released a statement about the meeting: "Republican leaders made explicitly clear our unwavering commitment to human rights and individual liberty. I believe it was vitally important that we used this opportunity to address the basic lack of freedom — speech, liberty, assembly, the press — in China. ... As I said in China this spring, there is no place for abuse in what must be considered the family of man. There is no place for torture and arbitrary detention. There is no place for forced confessions. There is no place for intolerance of dissent. "While we walked through the Rotunda. I explained to President Jiang how the roots of American rule of law go back more than 700 years, to the signing of the Magna Carta." Gingrich now: Gingrich appeared on the Fox News Channel show On the Record with Greta Van Susteren on April 26, 2009, and said he wasn't sure whether waterboarding was torture. "I honestly don't know," Gingrich told Van Susteren. "I think it's debatable. Lawyers I respect a great deal say it is absolutely within the law; other lawyers say it absolutely is not in the law." Whether it's considered torture or not, Gingrich said waterboarding was "something we shouldn't do." Gingrich explained that it might be warranted in extreme situations. "I am exactly where Sen. (John) McCain was. Sen. McCain said there are very rare circumstances where extreme measures should be used. And those circumstances should be personally signed by the president as commander in chief. And a good example is if you pick up somebody who has planted a nuclear weapon in Washington or New York or Los Angeles or Atlanta and you're trying to find out in the next three hours, where is the nuclear weapon, the president of the United States may well authorize remarkably tough measures because 100,000 or a half million lives are at stake." (Finally, we should note that Gingrich's view that torture is sometimes acceptable is shared by many Americans. A recent Pew poll found that only 25 percent of respondents said that torture is "never" justified. Seventy-one percent felt that torture was justified rarely, sometimes or often.) So, to measure the flip-flop: Gingrich in the past took a more absolute posture on prisoner treatment, saying that "there is no place for abuse in what must be considered the family of man." Now he appears to say that it is okay in extreme cases. If Gingrich had argued, like former Vice President Dick Cheney has, that "enhanced interrogation" is an effective technique and should be used without hesitation, we would be inclined to give him a Full Flop rating. But Gingrich seems to say that torture should be used only in special cases. So we'll give him a Half Flip.	None	Newt Gingrich	None	None	None	2009-04-28T19:49:06	2009-04-24	['None']
pomt-04474	Eric Cantor "took $5 million from Sheldon Adelson," a Las Vegas casino owner.	mostly false	/virginia/statements/2012/oct/08/wayne-powell/wayne-powell-says-eric-cantor-took-5-million-casin/	In a recent debate, Democrat challenger Wayne Powell accused U.S. Rep. Eric Cantor of receiving a fortune in contributions from a a billionaire Las Vegas casino owner. "You took $5 million from Sheldon Adelson," Powell said. Cantor denounced the accusation as "untrue." We checked Powell’s claim that the House majority leader received $5 million from Adelson, chairman of the Las Vegas Sands Corp. casino empire who is making massive contributions to Republican political action committees this year. Adelson is chairman of the Republican Jewish Coalition, an organization that is trying to get Jews to support GOP candidates. Cantor is a member of the coalition. Powell’s campaign cited a July 15, article in Politico about how Adelson and his wife, Miriam, donated $5 million to the YG Action Fund, a super PAC that Politico said is "backed" by Cantor. The story said the couple together had also given another $5 million in February to another Republican super PAC -- the Congressional Leadership Fund -- "backed" by Cantor and other House leaders. We verified the contributions through records through a database kept by the Center for Responsive Politics of political contributions reported to the Federal Election Commission. It showed Adelson and his wife each gave $2.5 million to the YG Action Fund on April 30 of this year. The super PAC, as Politico noted, had been lagging in fundraising before the Adelsons stepped in, collecting just $55,000 for the first three months of the year. YG gets its name from the "Young Guns" label given to a triumvirate of House Republican leaders: Cantor; vice-presidential candidate Paul Ryan; and Rep. Kevin McCarthy, R-Ca. The three co-authored a 2010 book titled, "Young Guns: a New Generation of Conservative Leaders." On its website, the super PAC said it is "dedicated to supporting conservative candidates to elected office who hold true to the Young Guns movement." Two former Cantor aides play key roles in the super PAC. John Murray, the House majority leader’s former deputy chief of staff, is president and treasurer. Brad Dayspring -- also a former deputy chief to Cantor -- is an advisor to the super pac, according to a synopsis from Center for Public Integrity. Super PACs arose in the wake of a 2010 Supreme Court decision that allowed unlimited corporate and union spending on elections. Super PACs can raise unlimited amounts of money from corporations, unions, and individuals and spend it to advocate for or against political candidates. But under law, super PACs are not allowed to coordinate their spending with any particular campaign or candidate. They are barred from giving directly to political candidates. Powell’s campaign also pointed to a Politico article that said Cantor’s former aides who run the super PAC still provide the House Majority Leader with messaging advice. Every Republican is Crucial (ERIC) PAC, controlled by Cantor, contributed $5,000 to the YG Action Fund on March 28 -- a month before the Adelsons’ big donations. In early March, Cantor irritated many Republicans by taking sides in a GOP primary in which two House incumbents from Illinois were forced to run against each other because of redistricting. Cantor endorsed freshman Rep. Adam Kinzinger over 10-term Rep. Don Manzullo. Three weeks later, the YG Action Fund paid $52,000 to air a pro-Kinzinger radio commercial. So is donating to YG the tantamount to giving money to Cantor, as Powell says? Ray Allen, Jr., a Cantor adviser, said no. The super Pac and Cantor’s congressional re-election fund are "distinctly different and legally separate entities." "Just as people do not confuse donating to the Republican Party with donating to Cantor for Congress, people understand the difference between donating to the YG Action Fund and donating to Cantor for Congress," Allen said in an e-mail. Larry Sabato, a University of Virginia political scientist, offered a different take. "Cantor is technically correct that he didn’t accept the money, but in the big picture, Adelson has gained influence with Cantor by donating $5 million to the Young Guns," he said. "Does Cantor personally call the shots at the YG Action Fund? No. But if Eric Cantor wanted some candidate to be funded by the YG Action Fund, you can rest assured that would happen." Since 2001, the Adelson’s have contributed $30,800 to Cantor’s re-election campaigns and $15,000 to Eric PAC. Our ruling Powell said Cantor "took $5 million from Sheldon Adelson." That’s not correct. Adelson and his wife gave $5 million to the YG Action Fund. Cantor has close ties to the super PAC, which is run by two former senior advisers to the majority leader. The group takes its name from "Young Guns," the title of a book Cantor co-authored. Powell would have been correct in saying a super PAC closely tied to Cantor took $5 million from the Adelsons. But he exaggerated when he said Cantor took the money; the YG Action Fund is required to operate independently of Cantor. So we find an element of truth in a largely inaccurate statement. We rate Powell’s claim Mostly False.	None	Wayne Powell	None	None	None	2012-10-08T12:51:54	2012-10-01	['Las_Vegas', 'Sheldon_Adelson', 'Eric_Cantor']
pomt-12817	"Tanzania farmers face 12 years in prison for trading seeds thanks to foreign aid."	mostly true	/global-news/statements/2017/feb/10/danielle-nierenberg/do-tanzania-farmers-face-prison-terms-trading-seed/	It’s a story of foreign aid doing more harm than good. Money from western governments intended to lift farmers out of poverty has inadvertently opened a pathway to imprisonment in Tanzania, according to Danielle Nierenberg, president of the advocacy group Food Tank. Nierenberg said on Twitter that Tanzania farmers face 12 years in prison for trading seeds thanks to foreign aid. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com The link between the aid and the prison terms is more indirect than the tweet suggests, but Nierenberg is right that a development program spurred (apparently unenforced) policy changes in Tanzania that includes jail time. Let’s parse it out. A questionable alliance Nierenberg told us her source was a December 2016 article in Mondiaal Nieuws, a Flemish magazine. According to the article, Tanzania passed intellectual property rights legislation on seeds as a condition for receiving aid through the New Alliance for Food Security and Nutrition. Spearheaded by the White House in 2012, the New Alliance brings together G8 countries, African governments, development partners, corporations and local businesses. It aims to lift 50 million people out of poverty in sub-Saharan Africa by 2022. Under the alliance, G8 countries (France, Germany, Italy, the United Kingdom, Japan, the United States, Canada, and Russia) and the European Union committed to providing funding, and hundreds of companies promised investments. Simultaneously, the 10 participating African nations agreed to enact policies to advance agriculture and reduce hunger. But food and poverty advocacy groups say the alliance benefits big agricultural businesses at the expense of small-scale farmers. Seed law reform, in particular, "raises serious concerns that governments will prioritize the adoption and enforcement of strict intellectual property protections of companies over the rights of small-scale producers to develop, save, re-use, exchange, and sell seeds," according to Oxfam. All participating African countries, except Benin, committed to reform seed laws in their cooperation frameworks. Nigeria and Mozambique agreed to comply with seed standards set by regional development organizations. Tanzania, meanwhile, stands out for its even more stringent seed protection goals. The East African country committed to updating laws to align with the International Union for the Protection of New Variety of Plants (UPOV). Members of UPOV, most of which are developed countries, agree to international intellectual property standards for protecting new plant varieties. Under the most recent convention, UPOV 1991, small farmers are no longer able to save, sell or exchange farm-saved seeds, according to Intellectual Property Watch’s Catherine Saez. In 2014, Tanzania enacted a Plant Breeders’ Rights Act — to the objection of farmers’ organizations and civil society organizations. The new breeders’ rights law "disregards the contributions of small-scale farmers, marginalizes their varieties and adversely impacts on their interests and livelihoods as it severely restricts farmers from engaging in their customary practices of freely sharing, exchanging and selling seed/propagating material," 10 organizations wrote in a letter. The legislation protects the intellectual property rights of plant varieties new to Tanzania, and penalizes violators with a fine of 2 million to 10 million Tanzanian shilling (about $900 to $4,500) or up to three years imprisonment, or both. Tanzania also amended its 2003 Seed Act to align with the 1991 UPOV convention and became a member state a year later — to the objection of farmers’ organizations and civil society organizations. The amended seed act imposes a fine of 100 million to 500 million Tanzanian shilling (about $445,000 to $225,230) or between five to 12 years imprisonment, or both, for selling or trading any certified seeds. That being said, we weren't able to find any instances of the fines or prison terms actually imposed on any farmer. Ebe Daems, the author of the Mondiaal Nieuws article Nierenberg cited, told us she wasn't aware of the law being applied either. "The government was claiming the law wasn't intended to be used against small farmers," she said. "NGO's were lobbying to add an explicit exception for small farmers to the law. I don't know if they got anywhere with that by now." Cash with strings? Under the New Alliance, Tanzania received $897 million in funding from developed countries (including $315 million from the United States) and hundreds of millions in investments from corporations. But it’s unclear if this aid was contingent upon Tanzania agreeing to enact more stringent seed protections. Heidi Chow, a food campaigner at the U.K.-based Global Justice Now, characterized the policy update as a conditional for receiving the money. "Big agribusinesses have identified the African continent as the last frontier with the most untapped market potential. What this aid scheme is doing is facilitating that process," Chow said. "The whole UPOV agenda is being very heavily pushed in Africa." Kate Van Waes, policy director of the One campaign, was more skeptical. She pointed out that the seed protections also limited government control on prices and distributions of the seeds. "How the policies that were decided upon got put into place was mostly between governments," she said, adding that the policy provisions aligned with each African nation’s Comprehensive Africa Agriculture Development Programme plans. "I think privatization of the seed sector was something that has been going on for a while. Whether there were conditions, I don’t know." Most advocates agree that the New Alliance lacks transparency and input from farmers and citizens, but there’s disagreement on whether corporations should be playing a role at all. "Sometimes there’s a tendency when you hear privatization is involved (to assume) it’s under the big bad Monsanto thing," said Van Waes. "There’s no way for donor governments or African countries to do it on their own. You have to pull in the private sector." African governments actively welcomed the New Alliance to attract investments to their countries, Chow said, but this led to policies that ceded control of food systems to agribusinesses and protected their investments. "We’re using state money, taxpayer money to change to the African countries’ laws to create a structure that structurally benefits the corporations," she said. "Aid should be aid. You can’t tie it up around policy changes." Our ruling Nierenberg tweeted, "Tanzania farmers face 12 years in prison for trading seeds thanks to foreign aid." Under the New Alliance for Food Security and Nutrition, Tanzania received millions in aid and investments from Western governments and businesses. At the same time, it enacted stronger intellectual property rights for seed varieties that included a maximum sentence of 12 years for violations. So the penalty is an indirect effect of the aid, but whether the sentence was a condition for it is unclear. Futhermore, the government doesn't appear to be enforcing the law.

pomt-05814	Says Republican U.S. Senate candidate Ted Cruz "opposes the DREAM Act, which is supported by 85% of Latinos."	true	/texas/statements/2012/feb/21/texas-democratic-party/texas-democratic-party-says-ted-cruz-opposes-dream/	In a Feb. 3, 2012, press release, a Texas Democratic Party spokeswoman charged Republicans with using the Latino community "as a wedge to gain support from the extreme wing of their party." Among the examples of what the release sarcastically calls "GOP Latino-outreach efforts" is this statement: "Ted Cruz forcefully opposes the DREAM Act, which is supported by 85% of Latinos." The DREAM Act — which stands for Development, Relief and Education for Alien Minors — would provide illegal immigrants who were brought to the United States as children a path to permanent residency if they attend college or serve in the military. The Democratic Party’s statement led us to a two-part fact-check. Let’s start with how Cruz, a Republican candidate for U.S. Senate, stands on the cited act. We didn’t have to look far. In a transcribed interview with blogger Sonja Harris of Conservatives in Action that Cruz has on his campaign website, the candidate says: "I do not support the DREAM Act and categorically oppose amnesty. I categorically oppose amnesty, and I strongly support legal immigration for those that have followed the rules and come here to pursue the American dream." In December 2010, the U.S. House, which then had a Democratic majority, approved a version of the act. The proposal did not make it through the Senate. Critics of the plan, including many Republicans, say it amounts to amnesty for some illegal immigrants. So, Cruz opposes the act. But is it supported by 85 percent of Latinos? Fortunately for us, PolitiFact Florida recently looked into a similar claim in an ad from the left-leaning political group Presente Action. Concentrating on polls, our colleagues found many national ones that looked at general public opinion on issues such as the DREAM Act, and those polls included Latino respondents. But polls on the opinions of Latinos as a group must have enough Latino respondents to be statistically valid, and most general polls do not meet this standard. However, PolitiFact found two major polling groups that focus on Latinos: Latino Decisions and the Pew Hispanic Center. In its 2011 National Survey of Latinos, the Pew Hispanic Center found that 91 percent favored the DREAM Act when asked this question: "Thinking about immigrants whose parents brought them to the United States illegally when they were children … would you favor or oppose a law that would let these young adults become legal residents if they go to college or serve in the military for two years?" The most recent national poll from Latino Decisions, conducted in January 2012 with Univision News and ABC News, asked: "Do you support or oppose the DREAM Act, which would provide undocumented immigrant youth a path to citizenship if they attend college or serve in the U.S. military?" It found that 66 percent strongly supported the law and an additional 19 percent somewhat supported the law, for a total of 85 percent. In each poll, the margin of error was about 4 percentage points. When we asked the Texas Democratic Party for backup information, spokeswoman Rebecca Acuña also pointed us to a February 2011 national poll by Latino Decisions, with impreMedia, publisher of Spanish-language newspapers in Texas, California, New York and other states. Respondents were asked about the DREAM Act in a section of the survey that began: "In December 2010, Congress considered a number of different policies. For each policy that I read, please tell me whether you approve or disapprove and how strongly." The poll described the DREAM Act as providing "undocumented immigrant children a path to citizenship if they attend college or serve in the U.S. military." The results: 67 percent of respondents said they strongly approved of the legislation and 18 percent said they somewhat approved, for a total — again — of 85 percent. (The margin of error was about 4 percentage points.) Our ruling Cruz said in an interview that he does not support the DREAM Act, and three polls over the past 13 months have shown at least 85 percent of Latinos favoring the legislation. We rate the Texas Democratic Party’s statement True.	None	Texas Democratic Party	None	None	None	2012-02-21T06:00:00	2012-02-03	['Ted_Cruz', 'United_States', 'Hispanic_and_Latino_Americans']
pomt-09783	"Recent census data shows that the average American family spends over $13,000 a year for health care coverage."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/sep/22/bruce-braley/iowa-democrat-says-families-spend-13000-year-healt/	One of the biggest skirmishes in the health care debate has been over how much ordinary Americans pay for coverage — either under the current system, as Democrats like to point out, or under the new Democratic proposals, as Republicans regularly emphasize. In a Sept. 16, 2009, speech on the House floor, Democratic Rep. Bruce Braley of Iowa argued in favor of the House health care bill, H.R. 3200, by asserting that the status quo is financially unsustainable. "Recent census data shows that the average American family spends over $13,000 a year for health care coverage," Braley said. "And if we don’t change what we are doing right now, in 10 years the average American family will be spending over $25,000 a year on health care coverage. That’s why the time to act is now, and H.R. 3200 does that by expanding access to quality, affordable coverage and bringing true health care reform to the American people." For this item, we'll focus on the assertion that the average American family spends over $13,000 a year for health care coverage. We called Braley's office, and staffers acknowledged that Braley misspoke when he said the numbers come from the Census Bureau. In fact, the numbers come from a study released the day before Braley spoke — a survey of employer-provided health care undertaken annually by the Kaiser Family Foundation and the Health Research & Educational Trust, an affiliate of the American Hospital Association. The Kaiser/HRET study found that the average annual premium for family coverage under an employer-based plan is $13,375. To come up with that figure, the study used data from 3,188 randomly selected employers with three or more employees. But there's a problem: It's not accurate to say, as Braley does, that "the average American family spends over $13,000 a year for health care coverage." It's true that Kaiser/HRET found the total cost of health care premiums for a family to be $13,375 — but that is not the amount the average family pays out of its own pocket. This is not a trivial distinction. For employer-based health care, which was the only kind Kaiser/HRET studied, the employer pays nearly three-quarters of the freight — $9,860 to be exact, compared with $3,515 for the employee. Now, there are legitimate concerns about health care costing $13,375 per family per year. It's a substantial economic burden for companies to pay so much for their workers' health care, and doing so probably holds down employee wages and economic growth. But Braley didn't say that the high premiums are an economic burden on the economy or on companies. He specifically said that $13,000 is what "the average American family spends." And that's not correct. The Kaiser/HRET estimate of the family share being $3,515 is in the same ballpark as others. The Consumer Expenditure Survey, produced by the federal Bureau of Labor Statistics, found that household health care expenditures — which go beyond just health insurance premiums — were $2,853 in 2007, the last year for which data are available. (Only Americans with employer-sponsored health care are included in the Kaiser/HRET survey, which accounts for much of the difference between the two surveys.) A third study, brought to our attention by Braley's staff, was by Milliman Inc., a health care and benefits consulting firm. A study of 2009 health care costs found that the average cost for a family of four is $16,771. The number is a bit higher than Kaiser/HRT's because it also includes family out-of-pocket costs rather than just the cost of insurance premiums. Calculating it this way does increase the size of the employee share of all health care costs. According to the Milliman study, employees paid $4,004 for health premiums and $2,820 out of pocket, for a total of $6,824. (The employer contribution was $9,947.) So, Milliman has employers paying a larger dollar amount than what Kaiser found, but the family portion is still well short of the $13,000 Braley cited. As was the case in a number of other recent PolitiFact items we deemed False (including this one and this one ), Braley would have been correct if he'd simply tweaked what he said. If he'd cited data showing that "the annual health care premiums for the average American family are greater than $13,000," he would have been right. But by adding confusion to the debate, Braley has muddied some already murky waters. In a Sept. 20, 2009, column prompted by the Kaiser/HRET study, Ezra Klein of the Washington Post summarized why misconceptions about the cost of health care matter. "Imagine if people who touched a hot stove felt only a small fraction of the pain from the burn," Klein wrote. "That's pretty much what's happening in our health care system. It hurts enough that we would prefer it to stop, but the urgency is lost. That's the dilemma for Washington wonks trying to fix this mess: They look at the numbers and see health care costs crushing our economy, overwhelming our government, swallowing our wages. But the public isn't feeling it. Virtually no one cuts a $13,375 check for health care. Most pay 27 percent of it, or even less." Jeff Giertz, the communications director for Braley, acknowledged PolitiFact's interpretation of the data, but added, "Regardless of how you measure it, the costs are high and getting higher — there’s certainly no disputing that." Still, even inadvertently glossing over the meaning of these numbers gives the false impression that American families are paying approximately four times as much as they actually are for health care. We rate Braley's statement False.	None	Bruce Braley	None	None	None	2009-09-22T18:39:43	2009-09-16	['United_States']
pomt-09358	"With this reform, every insured American gets valuable consumer protections, and every uninsured American can become insured."	true	/texas/statements/2010/apr/02/lloyd-doggett/rep-lloyd-doggett-says-health-care-reform-has-cons/	Days before President Barack Obama signed the health care reform bill into law, U.S. Rep. Lloyd Doggett, D-Austin, delivered a speech on the House floor saying "you can certainly sum up our many, many pages with four words: 'You've got health care.' "With this reform," Doggett said March 21, "every insured American gets valuable consumer protections, and every uninsured American can become insured." We wondered if Doggett accurately characterized those many pages of the law. Let's start with his proclamation of consumer protections. Sarah Dohl, Doggett's communications director, pointed to 11 consumer protections in the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act that Obama signed on March 23, plus the House reconciliation bill he signed March 30. This year, for starters, adult children can stay on their parents' health insurance policies until they turn 26. Second, insurers are prohibited from rescinding coverage except in cases of fraud. Third, insurers can't refuse coverage for children for a particular illness — say, asthma — if the child is accepted into a plan or is currently covered on a plan. There's more: Insurers can no longer place lifetime caps on how much they'll pay out. Consumers in private plans will have access to an independent appeals process to contest decisions made by their insurers. Also, insurers won't be able to deny coverage or charge higher premiums because of a person's gender or pre-existing medical conditions. What about Doggett's statement that every uninsured American can now become insured? Keeping in mind that "can" is not the same as "will" and that some parts of the new law will take years to kick in, more people do stand to be insured. Today, some 83 percent of Americans — excluding illegal immigrants — have coverage either through their employer, the private market or government programs such as Medicaid and the Children's Health Insurance Program. The new law is expected to increase the share of insured Americans to 94 percent by 2019, according to the non-partisan Congressional Budget Office. As of June, people with pre-existing medical conditions can get coverage from a temporary national high-risk pool set to last until 2014 when insurers will be barred from denying coverage to anyone for any reason. Also starting in 2014, most people will be required to have health insurance. There are a handful of exceptions, but individuals who aren't exempt and refuse to sign up with a plan will be required to pay an annual penalty of the greater of $695 per person, up to a maximum of $2,085 per family, or 2.5 percent of household income, whichever is greater. Other aspects of the new law are aimed at easing access to insurance. In 2013, the federal government will create the "consumer operated and oriented" plan to foster the creation of nonprofit, member-run health insurance cooperatives in each state and the District of Columbia. Come 2014, individuals and small businesses with up to 100 employees can purchase coverage administered by a governmental agency or nonprofit organization. That year, Medicaid will be open to anyone under 65 making up to 133 percent of the federal poverty level — which this year is $14,404 for an individual and $29,327 for a family of four. According to the nonpartisan Kaiser Family Foundation, which has analyzed all the major health care proposals: "This expansion will create a uniform minimum Medicaid eligibility threshold across states and will eliminate a limitation of the program that prohibits most adults without dependent children from enrolling in the program today." Per current law, undocumented immigrants won't be eligible for Medicaid. Another future change, according to Kaiser: Individuals whose incomes are greater than 133 percent of the poverty level who don't have access to affordable coverage through their employer will be able to purchase it through a state-based exchange by 2014. 2014 is the year when Doggett's characterization will prove true. John Greeley, a spokesman for the Texas Department of Insurance, told us that every Texan can already obtain insurance if they choose to do so. Greeley pointed to the Texas Health Insurance Risk Pool, a high-risk pool created by state lawmakers to provide health insurance to residents who lose coverage under a group plan or who can't obtain coverage from an insurer on the private market because of a pre-existing medical condition. (Texas is one of 34 states that have such high-risk pools.) But Stacey Pogue, senior policy analyst at the left-leaning Center for Public Policy Priorities, noted that access to insurance is not always a cinch. An individual may not qualify for coverage, she said, or may not be able to afford it. Per the Texas Insurance Code, the pool's premiums rates are double the rates premiums offered by private insurers,in the private market, to avoid competition with them. As of March, 26,564 Texas residents were insured through the pool, and 6.1 million residents were uninsured, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. Now, where does that leave us with Doggett's floor statement? He's right about the law introducing consumer protections. Also, the law is expected to ease access to coverage, though not everyone benefits immediately. Still, starting in 2014, every American will be able to sign up for insurance. We rate Doggett's statement as True.	None	Lloyd Doggett	None	None	None	2010-04-02T17:57:22	2010-03-21	['United_States']
pomt-13186	Says Donald Trump is "the first person running for president, Republican or Democrat, who refused to say that he would respect the results of this election."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/oct/25/hillary-clinton/trump-first-ever-candidate-not-say-hell-accept-ele/	Politicians and commentators on both sides of the aisle have expressed shock at Donald Trump’s refusal to say he’ll accept the outcome of the Nov. 8 election. Many have said Trump’s comments, as well as his baseless accusations that the election is "rigged," are unprecedented in modern politics. That includes his opponent, Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton. "During that debate, Donald said something — well, he said a lot of things that were troubling. But he said something truly horrifying: He became the first person running for president, Republican or Democrat, who refused to say that he would respect the results of this election," Clinton said at an Oct. 24 rally in New Hampshire. "Now that is a direct threat to our democracy." We wondered if Trump really is the first presidential candidate in American history who would not say that he’ll accept the election results. It’s difficult to prove a negative. But historians and experts in campaign rhetoric told us that while campaigns have challenged results after Election Day, they are unaware of any prior presidential candidate casting so much doubt about an election before it even happens. Before we get into the historical context, let’s take a quick look at Trump’s exact words from the final presidential debate Oct. 19. Moderator Chris Wallace asked Trump if he would "absolutely accept the result of this election." "I will look at it at the time," Trump said. "I'm not looking at anything now. I'll look at it at the time." "But, sir," Wallace said, "there is a tradition in this country — in fact, one of the prides of this country — is the peaceful transition of power and that no matter how hard-fought a campaign is, that at the end of the campaign that the loser concedes to the winner. Are you saying you're not prepared now to commit to that principle?" Trump responded, "What I'm saying is that I will tell you at the time. I'll keep you in suspense. Okay?" The fact that Trump has to answer a question like this is a first, said Tammy Vigil, a Boston University professor who researches campaign rhetoric. There’s no precedent for a major party candidate being so publicly skeptical of an upcoming election. "Most major party candidates do not make contesting the results an issue; it is simply assumed that they will accept the outcome of the vote," Vigil said. "For that reason few candidates are ever asked the question in as direct a manner as Trump was asked it in the debate. The fact of him having to answer a direct query makes it unusual, and so his answer is unusual." Historical context Trump is certainly not the first candidate in recent memory to question whether there will be voter fraud. In 2008, Republican nominee John McCain said the Association of Community Organizations for Reform Now, Acorn, was "on the verge of maybe perpetrating one of the greatest frauds in voter history in this country, maybe destroying the fabric of democracy." McCain's statement and others like it, though, are not equivalent to saying they might not accept the final results. Historians pointed out several examples of elections in the 19th and 20th centuries when the popular vote or electoral college vote was so close that the final results were controversial. But in none of those cases did the presidential candidate challenge the election before it took happened. Take the most recent example: the 2000 election between George W. Bush and Al Gore, the results of which eventually came down in a Supreme Court decision. In that case, it wasn’t until after Election Day that Gore requested the recount in Florida. After an exceptionally close race between Richard Nixon and John F. Kennedy in 1960, some Republicans called for a recount, but Nixon distanced himself from them. In the 1800s, several elections fell into the hands of Congress. In those cases, the political parties questioned whether the final results — not the popular vote but the pending congressional decisions — would be legitimate, said Alex Keyssar, a Harvard University professor and expert in voting history. However, he added that the candidates themselves did not question the legitimacy of the outcome before the election took place. And eventually, they conceded, said Brian Rosenwald, a fellow at the University of Pennsylvania. "Even in 1800, 1824 and 1876, where resolutions took almost until Inauguration Day, we had an outcome accepted, if grudgingly and with concessions, from both parties," Rosenwald said. "People on the losing sides in these elections, as well as 1960 and 2000, often went to their graves believing that they’d had an election stolen from them, but they didn’t move to start or encourage a rebellion." Also notable is the 1860 race. In the lead-up to that election, politicians in several southern states plotted to secede if Abraham Lincoln were to win, said Daniel Feller, a professor of mid 19th century history at the University of Tennessee. Lincoln won, the southern states seceded, and the country descended into civil war. But none of the four presidential candidates that year advocated on the campaign trail for secession if Lincoln were to win, Feller said. Additionally, the South viewed the election results as legitimate and as confirmation that the northern states wanted to stifle their way of life. "Have other presidential candidates announced beforehand they would not accept the results of the election? Not to my knowledge," Feller said. "But has there been a case when enough Americans rejected the results of the election to disrupt the system? Yes." Our ruling Clinton said Trump is "the first person running for president, Republican or Democrat, who refused to say that he would respect the results of this election." There are examples of presidential campaigns challenging elections or raising concerns about corruption after Election Day. But historians and experts cannot point to an example of a presidential candidate himself refusing to say he would accept the results before the election even happens. We couldn't find one, either. If an example of a past presidential candidate saying something equivalent to Trump comes up, or if we find additional information to support Clinton's claim, we’ll update our story. But with the information we have available, for now we rate Clinton’s claim Mostly True. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/075ca508-d586-4024-b79e-5c4d637ae144	None	Hillary Clinton	None	None	None	2016-10-25T16:28:07	2016-10-24	['Republican_Party_(United_States)', 'Democratic_Party_(United_States)']
pomt-07727	The high-speed rail project would create "60,000-plus jobs for Floridians."	false	/florida/statements/2011/mar/02/corrine-brown/rail-proponent-says-high-speed-rail-creates-60000-/	Critics of Florida Gov. Rick Scott's refusal of $2.4 billion in federal money for high-speed rail often knock his decision for its apparent hypocrisy: Shutting down the project will cost tens of thousands of jobs, they say, a move that goes against the governor's oft-referenced No. 1 priority. One pro-rail member of Congress, Rep. Corrine Brown, D-Jacksonville, put the jobs estimate higher than any projection we've seen -- about three times as high. "We are going to continue to work for those 60,000-plus jobs for Floridians," Brown told Orlando's WESH-TV on Feb. 17, 2011, the day after Scott announced his intent to reject the money. "With unemployment at 12 percent, we've just got to work this out for the people of Florida." Brown made the 60,000-jobs claim in several news releases, and repeated the figure on March 1 in comments from the floor of the U.S. House of Representatives. Is Scott turning his back on 60,000 jobs -- a little less than 10 percent of the 700,000 jobs he promised to create -- by nixing the Tampa-to-Orlando high-speed rail line? To find out, we turned to the Florida Department of Transportation, which has managed the state's high-speed rail plan since 1991. FDOT's application for federal rail money included predicted economic benefits to the Tampa-Orlando corridor, including the creation of 23,600 direct jobs, like construction and design, and 26,300 indirect jobs, like those created for equipment suppliers. FDOT calculated these jobs in something called "job-years," which, in short, refers to the number of jobs that will be funded each year. Job-years are not how you'd probably think of a job. So let us explain. In the first year of rail construction, 2011, FDOT estimated the project would require a total of 2,100 construction workers and an additional 700 workers providing engineering services. Another 3,400 spinoff workers would be created in the first year, FDOT estimated. That's a total of 6,200 jobs. Construction would then ramp up in 2012 -- ballooning the work force from 6,200 to 21,600, an increase of 15,400 workers. On the surface, most people would say the rail project created jobs for 21,600 people -- some having a job for one year, others having a job for two. But in "job-years," the actual number is 27,800. Here's how FDOT comes up that: They start with the 6,200 jobs from 2011, then add the 21,600 jobs from 2012. The number of jobs created in the final two years of construction decreases. In 2013, a total of 18,900 direct and indirect jobs would be needed to service the construction of the rail line. In 2014, the number drops to 2,100. A report by the Central Florida Partnership, an Orlando-area economic development group, explained it more bluntly: peak rail employment would occur between fall 2012-14 and require about 10,000 workers. That excludes indirect jobs. After the rail line is up and running, FDOT said it will create 600 permanent jobs to operate the 84-mile line and 500 permanent spinoff jobs. In the most optimistic terms, that's 49,900 "job-years" created over a five-year window, including 1,100 permanent jobs. That's short of 60,000 -- the figure cited by Brown -- and that's without even factoring in the jobs vs. job-years part of the claim. Really, the best way to look at the rail project is to say that it would employ directly or indirectly 6,200 workers in 2011, 21,600 workers in 2012, 18,900 workers in 2013, 2,100 workers in 2014 and then 1,100 workers thereafter. But to count job-years, FDOT is adding each year's job count to one big number: 49,900. David Simon, a spokesman for Brown, said he has seen different job numbers for the high-speed rail project, and was not sure where Brown got her 60,000-job figure. He believed it may have come from the state, but noted that the state's high-speed rail website has been taken down and is no longer accessible. Whatever the number, he said, people should be asking Scott why he wants to kill the jobs created by the high-speed rail project. Maybe so. But we're here simply to examine Brown's numbers. In the media, in press releases, and on the floor of the U.S. House of Representatives, Brown said the Tampa-to-Orlando high-speed rail project would create 60,000 jobs. That number is too high. In reality, the project would create construction and construction spinoff jobs for parts of four years. The number of the jobs varies depending on the year of construction, but peaks at a total of 21,600 jobs in the second year of work. Once the high-speed rail line is operational, the state anticipates the creation of 1,100 permanent direct and indirect jobs. Yes, the project creates jobs. But not to the extent Brown suggests. We rate this claim False.	None	Corrine Brown	None	None	None	2011-03-02T18:22:22	2011-02-17	['None']
pomt-06358	Repealing the health care law "would save $95 billion in 2016."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/nov/04/mitt-romney/mitt-romney-said-repealing-obamacare-would-save-95/	Mitt Romney has recently been emphasizing one of the favorite themes of the tea party movement: cutting government spending. He’s been getting pretty specific about some of his ideas, both in an op-ed in USA Today and in speeches on the campaign trail. His plans include ending subsidies for Amtrak, stopping funding the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, and eliminating foreign aid to countries "that oppose America’s interests." He also wants to save money by rolling back President Barack Obama’s signature health care law. He made the point in the USA Today op-ed, suggesting he would "repeal ObamaCare, which would save $95 billion in 2016." We were surprised by his suggestion. As we remembered the health care negotiations, Democrats took pains to make sure the 2010 health care law was projected to reduce the deficit, and they bragged repeatedly about their numbers. We contacted the Romney campaign, which referred us to an analysis by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, the agency that independently calculates the cost of laws proposed by both parties. In February 2011, the CBO published an analysis of a Republican measure to fully repeal the health care law. The analysis was for H.R. 2, "the Repealing the Job-Killing Health Care Law Act," a simple repeal bill that House Republicans approved on Jan. 19, 2011. Keep in mind, though, that repealing the health care law doesn’t only cut spending. The law had many moving parts, some of which were revenue sources to offset the spending and reduce the overall federal deficit. The law spent money on providing tax subsidies to help people buy insurance and by expanding the Medicaid health insurance for the very poor. But it offset those additional costs by slowing the growth of future spending on Medicare, the health insurance program for Americans over age 65. And, it generated revenues for the government by creating new excise taxes on high-cost health insurance plans (the "Cadillac" plans); adding new Medicare taxes on people with high incomes; and charging new fees to health insurance companies and health care manufacturers. In other words, if you fully repeal the law, you would also be repealing things that reduce the deficit, such as cost reductions and higher taxes. Romney cited a reduction of $95 billion in 2016, but that number only counts what the law spends that year. Most of the spending is for subsidizing coverage for the uninsured. That same year, the law also is projected to raise revenues of $78 billion, largely through new taxes on the wealthy and new fees on the health care industry. So according to the CBO analysis, a full repeal of the bill would reduce the deficit by $16 billion in 2016, much less than the number Romney cited. And then there’s the broader picture: When the CBO looked at the first 10 years of repeal, from 2012 to 2021, it found that repeal added $210 billion to the deficit. So the deficit would actually be lower if the law is not repealed. Finally, we should note that a repeal of the law would not necessarily be "easy. "Romney would need to have solid Republican majorities in Congress, including 60 members in the Senate to block filibusters. If Romney had only criticized the law as an expansion of government spending, he would have been on firmer ground. Instead, he asserted that a repeal of the law would save significant money -- $95 billion. In fact, the law included new taxes and cost reductions so that the actual savings for the year he cited would be much smaller -- $16 billion. And, over the long haul, repealing the law actually adds significantly to the deficit. So we rate his statement False.	None	Mitt Romney	None	None	None	2011-11-04T17:47:44	2011-11-04	['None']
pomt-14749	Says Marco Rubio "is the one for an open border."	pants on fire!	/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/dec/15/rand-paul/rand-paul-said-marco-rubio-open-border/	U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio has been a target of some of his fellow GOP presidential candidates for his leadership on trying to change immigration laws in 2013. During the CNN debate in Las Vegas Dec. 15, U.S. Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky said that Rubio has opposed border security: "He thinks he wants to be this ‘Oh I am great and strong on national defense,’ but he is the weakest of all the candidates on immigration. He is the one for an open border that is leaving us defenseless." Is Rubio for an open border? In a word, no. An open border allows people to travel freely or with very few restrictions between two countries. Rubio wasn’t for an open border in 2013, nor does he support it this year while running for president. 2013 immigration law In 2013, Rubio and seven other senators (dubbed the Gang of Eight) crafted bipartisan legislation that passed the Senate. The bill required more border security before unauthorized immigrants could pursue legal status -- a path that included significant hurdles. As for border security, the bill included billions for border enforcement over a decade, for new surveillance equipment and fencing along the Mexican border, as well as adding 20,000 border agents. GOP Sens. John Hoeven of North Dakota and Bob Corker of Tennessee introduced the compromise amendment that included the beefed up security measures. The senators said that the additional border agents -- which would have doubled the number at the time -- would have cost $25 billion. At the time, Rubio told Fox News, "If you look at what’s being proposed here, this is a dramatic expansion and improvement in border security that I hope will allow finally for this legislation to have the support it needs." The Hill reported that Corker and Hoeven said Rubio played an active role in negotiating the amendment. In an interview on June 20, 2013, about a week before the Senate vote, Fox News’ Martha MacCallum asked Rubio if the bill would protect the border. "Well, it’s a dramatic improvement in border security," Rubio said. "It’s a major surge in border enforcement, and I think it’s important to explain why that’s necessary. Look, as I said before, America’s a special country, so special that people are willing to come here no matter what. Even some people are willing to risk their lives and do it illegally. And we’re compassionate about that, but we’re also a sovereign country. We have a right to protect our borders, every sovereign country does, and that’s why this is so critical." The bill died after House leadership refused to bring the bill to a vote. Rubio still supports changing immigration laws, but on the campaign trail he has called for a piecemeal approach and emphasized that he thinks border security must be beefed up before other changes to immigration laws. During the debate, he repeated many of those points when CNN’s Dana Bash asked Rubio if he still supports a path to citizenship. Rubio said that Americans won’t trust the federal government to change immigration laws until illegal immigration is under control. "We know what it takes to do that," Rubio said. "It takes at least 20,000 more additional border agents. It takes completing 100 miles of fencing. It takes a mandatory E-Verify system and a mandatory entry exit tracking system to prevent visa overstays." A spokesman for Rubio pointed to this statement when we asked about Paul's claim. Paul's team pointed to Rubio's work on the Gang of Eight bill as support for Paul's statement. But that legislation did not create or even suggest open borders. "If Sen. Rubio was really for open borders, the Gang of Eight bill wouldn't have been 1,198 pages long while doubling the size of border patrol," said Alex Nowrasteh, an expert on immigration at the libertarian Cato Institute. Steven Camarota, at the Center for Immigration Studies, which advocates for low levels of immigration, said that "open borders is always an overstatement." But the bill would have dramatically increased immigration, he said. Our ruling Paul said that Rubio "is the one for an open border." An open border allows people to travel freely or with very few restrictions between two countries. Rubio doesn’t support anything like that. He was one of the authors of a 2013 bill that included billions for border security and more border agents. After that bill died in the House, Rubio has repeatedly said that the border must be secured before the Senate can revisit changing immigration laws. The idea that Rubio supports an open border is inaccurate and ridiculous, so we rate Paul’s statement Pants on Fire.	None	Rand Paul	None	None	None	2015-12-15T23:39:48	2015-12-15	['None']
pomt-08090	Sen. Jim Webb "persists on negating" Sen. Mark Warner’s votes	false	/virginia/statements/2010/dec/15/george-allen/george-allen-says-sen-jim-webb-negates-votes-sen-m/	Former U.S. Sen. George Allen is taking aim at a rival who took away his seat in 2006, Sen. Jim Webb. In a Dec. 9 news release, Allen criticizes Webb for breaking with Virginia's junior senator, Democrat Mark Warner on two recent votes. Webb opposed banning earmarks and backed an unsuccessful effort to advance legislation that would give police and firefighters’ unions collective bargaining rights. Allen, a Republican, is considering a 2012 rematch with Webb. He says Webb, a Democrat, "canceled out Senator Warner’s" votes and "denied our commonwealth a voice in the Senate." Allen writes: "No one expects both of our Senators to agree all the time, but when one persists on negating the other, the will of a vast majority of Virginians is ignored, and the Commonwealth is bumped from a leadership role and onto the sidelines." We looked at Allen’s assertion that Webb "persists on negating" Warner’s votes. The Oxford Dictionary offers this definition for the verb persist : "Continue firmly or obstinately in an opinion or a course of action in spite of difficulty, opposition, or failure." Has Webb really established a pattern of parting with his fellow Virginia senator and party mate? We went to the voting records. According to Open Congress’s head-to-head comparison, the two senators have voted together 727 times time since Warner took office in January 2009, or 87 percent of the time. That’s 2 percentage points shy of the average voting similarity for Democrat senators -- 89 percent. So it seems hard to support the assertion that Webb "persists on negating" Warner while voting with him almost nine times out of 10. "Webb votes far more often with his fellow Democrat Warner than not, said Mark J. Rozell, a professor of public policy at George Mason University. "Picking a few issues of differences does not prove that the senators are marching in opposite directions." "But so what if they disagree some times?" he added. "Allen's argument is frankly silly. Are two senators supposed to vote as a unit on each issue merely because they are from the same state? Our electoral system never anticipated unity of state delegations. Let's say the House delegation from Virginia goes 6-5 on some issue. Does that mean that 10 members canceled each other out and only one mattered?" Larry Sabato, director of the Center for Politics at the University of Virginia, agreed. "It is highly misleading to suggest that Webb ‘persists’ in negating Warner," he said. "The Senate’s roll call records clearly show this is not true." Republican Senators vote together 78 percent of the time on average, according to Open Congress. So it would seem that there’s even more "negating" occurring on the other side of the aisle. Democrat and Republican senators average a 46 percent voting similarity. "The unusual twist here is that this is a tactic most often employed in a state when one senator is a Republican and the other senator a Democrat," Sabato said of Allen’s attack. "The irony is that the charge would almost certainly be accurate if the two Virginia senators were named Mark Warner and George Allen." Sabato’s point : If Allen were elected to replace Webb in 2012, the chances are nearly 100 percent that Warner and Allen would cancel out each other’s votes on the Senate floor far more often than do Warner and Webb. Just as point of interest, Webb votes with his party 85 percent of the time while Warner votes with party 91 percent of the time. So it’s clear that Allen is wrong to say that Webb persists in negating Warner based on total voting records. But maybe he’s pointing to a more recent trend. Since Congress reconvened in November after a recess, the two Virginia senators have both voted on 22 measures, differing on four of them (two of which are the basis for Allen’s claim). They agreed 82 percent of the time. That’s lightly lower than their average, but hardly a persistent disagreement. What about key votes? The senators voted together on health-care reform, the 2009 Stimulus bill, the Pay-As-You-Go Act increasing the statutory limit on the public debt, the HIRE Act, or Senate jobs bill, and most recently on the National Defense Authorization Act for FY11 (including the repeal of Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell) and the Dream Act. Not a lot of division on big issues. How about the suggestion that casting a differing vote is "negating" Warner’s, thereby robbing the Commonwealth of a voice? Couple problems there. 1) Why is Webb the one negating Warner? Couldn’t Warner just as easily be negating Webb? 2) Oxford defines "negate" as "nullify; make ineffective." Is a vote nullified or made ineffective just because one senator voted another way? Of course not. Virginia is not a sovereign federal entity in which legislation only affects the commonwealth if both of the state’s senators agree. "The constitutional framers created two senators from each state and staggered election cycles in part to ensure there would be different voices, which leads to better representation," Rozell noted. "Without independent judgment by each senator, why not just have one senator from each state?" Sabato said. "The assertion that one vote ‘negates’ the other is simplistic, obviously, since the real goal is to achieve 51 votes (most floor measures) or 60 votes (to shut off a filibuster and proceed to a vote) or 67 votes (treaties and impeachment convictions), depending on the circumstances." Let’s recap: On the basis of two votes upon which Virginia’s two senators differed, Allen claims that Webb has established a pattern of canceling out Warner’s votes, thereby neutralizing Virginia’s voice in the Senate. The argument is deeply flawed. Webb and Warner vote together 87 percent of the time, and rarely differ on key votes. Were a Republican to replace Webb, that percentage would undoubtedly plummet. Disagreeing doesn’t deny Virginia a voice in the Senate, it merely offers two opposing ones. We find the claim to be False.

pomt-13234	"It’s possible that non-citizen voters were responsible for Obama’s 2008 victory in North Carolina."	pants on fire!	/north-carolina/statements/2016/oct/19/donald-trump/trump-wrongfully-says-immigrants-voting-illegally-/	In his ongoing mission to claim that the presidential election is being rigged against him, Donald Trump said there have been real-world instances of stolen elections. We have already ruled Trump’s claims of "large scale voter fraud" nationwide this year to be Pants On Fire, but on Monday night Trump made a much more specific claim during a rally in Green Bay, Wisconsin. "It’s possible that non-citizen voters were responsible for Obama’s 2008 victory in North Carolina," Trump said. North Carolina’s 15 electoral votes hardly would have made 2008 Republican nominee John McCain the president – Obama won 365 votes in the Electoral College to McCain’s 173. But this claim of an illegitimate victory is still a pretty shocking accusation coming from the current Republican nominee. We wondered if it could be true. Could illegally cast ballots have handed North Carolina to Obama in 2008? North Carolina figures to be a toss-up again this year, after it narrowly went for Mitt Romney in 2012. A RealClearPolitics average of polling from the first half of October showed Hillary Clinton with a 3-point lead over Trump in the Tar Heel State. Evidence of illegal voting? Elections expert Rick Hasen, a professor of law and political science at UC-Irvine, said Trump is wrong. "I don’t think it’s possible," said Hasen, who runs the ElectionLawBlog.org website. But what do Trump and his campaign say about the statement? After Trump’s speech Monday, his campaign’s co-chairman Sam Clovis defended Trump’s argument in an interview with a radio show affiliated with the Boston Herald newspaper. "I don’t think it’s irresponsible," Clovis said. "I think it raises an issue." That issue, he said, is some states have made it easier for immigrants living here illegally to get driver’s licenses – and, he said, that makes it easier for them to vote. However, North Carolina does not allow such immigrants to get licenses at all, so it’s unclear why Clovis brought that up. Nevertheless, we did some digging and found what Trump or his speechwriters seemed to be citing – a 2014 op-ed from one of the newspapers Trump once banned from his rallies, the Washington Post. In it, two political science professors said they had studied how often immigrants – here legally or illegally – might vote in U.S. elections. Trump quoted from their study almost verbatim in his speech, although he did not mention that there are serious concerns over its validity. Significant statistical errors? On the Washington Post website, above the op-ed about the study, you see an editor’s note that the study has earned at least three separate rebuttals, as well as a peer-reviewed article saying the data the study used doesn’t provide evidence of what the study claimed. The original study’s authors have defended their work, but we have to ask: Is Trump citing a debunked study? The main issue deals with sourcing and sampling. The authors of the study didn’t do the survey work themselves but instead pulled it from data collected by the Harvard-affiliated Cooperative Congressional Election Study. However, two weeks after the study was first published in 2014, the CCES wrote a response that has advised researchers not to use its data in that way – because its data on non-citizens drew from a very small sample size of 339 respondents nationwide. The CCES furthermore said that it wasn’t specifically surveying non-citizen voting habits, so it didn’t correct for errors in that portion of its survey – and that it believed 16 or 17 percent of the respondents mistakenly reported they were non-citizens, either because they were confused or simply clicked the wrong box on the online survey. The CCES researchers repeated those concerns in another op-ed for the Washington Post, published this week after Trump resurfaced the old study that relied on their work. Among the 339 supposedly non-citizen respondents, 38 (11.3 percent) said they voted. The researchers in the study that Trump cited were unable to confirm 33 of those votes, leaving them with five verified votes (1.5 percent). Like the political scientists who have called this study into question, we have a hard time using five (or even 38) anecdotes to extrapolate a scenario for the entire country, involving millions of people. But for the sake of argument, we’ll put that apprehension aside and look at the data. There were approximately 650,000 immigrants in North Carolina in 2008, about a quarter of whom were citizens. That means there were approximately 487,500 non-citizen immigrants. Surely they weren’t all adults, but let’s pretend they were. If 1.5 percent of them voted, that would mean 7,313 non-citizens voted in North Carolina in 2008. Obama won the state by about 14,000 votes, so even if every single one of them had voted for Obama, their illegal voting would not have been enough to sway the election. So even using the widely criticized study’s findings, in order to come up with a result that influenced the election you would have to: 1. Double their verified rate of voting, 2. Assume that no immigrants are under the age of 18, and 3. Assume that McCain received 0 percent of the non-citizen vote. We simply don’t think that’s likely, and neither does at least one federal appeals court. Hasen, the election law expert, wrote in the Wall Street Journal this week that "the United States Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit concluded last month than only a "tiny fraction" of voters are non-citizens and that there is no evidence it is a serious problem." Actual allegations in North Carolina are few and far between We also checked with the N.C. Board of Elections, which said in a statement: "We have no indication that thousands of non-citizens voted in the 2008 elections, and we don’t believe that amount of potential voter fraud would have gone unnoticed or unchallenged." In 2008, North Carolina reported 23 allegations of non-residents either voting or registering to vote. Elections board spokesman Pat Gannon said while the office currently tracks such allegations after referring them to the courts, it did not in 2008, so it’s unclear how many of those 23 reported cases were actually illegal. Scott Huffmon, a political science professor at Winthrop University, said the 23 allegations could include immigrants (legal residents as well as those living here illegally) as well as U.S. citizens from other states. He also that, in general, it would make no sense for an immigrant living in the U.S. illegally to try to vote. "Would any rational person put themselves in jeopardy of being deported for the virtual zero probability of influencing an election?" Huffmon said. Our ruling Trump said "it’s possible" that Obama won North Carolina in 2008 because of non-citizens voting illegally. There is no evidence to support that theory, and that’s not for a lack of attention. A federal appeals court has looked into it, as has the N.C. Board of Elections, and both found nothing of concern. Political scientists also disagree with Trump. And even if the study Trump was citing is valid – although many say it's not – it still doesn’t back up Trump's claim. We rate this claim Pants on Fire. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/96c8274a-cbbd-4be5-b9dd-1afe2d6d2e19	None	Donald Trump	None	None	None	2016-10-19T18:39:20	2016-10-17	['Barack_Obama', 'North_Carolina']
pomt-06657	"In writing his book, Gov. Perry pointed out that … by any measure Social Security has been a failure."	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/sep/12/mitt-romney/mitt-romney-says-rick-perry-believes-social-securi/	At a Republican presidential debate in senior-rich Florida, Mitt Romney took Rick Perry to task on Social Security. "In writing his book, Gov. Perry pointed out that … by any measure Social Security has been a failure," Romney said in the CNN/Tea Party Express debate in Tampa on Sept. 12, 2011. Here's the full quote: WOLF BLITZER: "Gov. Romney, you said that Gov. Perry's position on Social Security is, quote, unacceptable and could even obliterate the Republican Party. Are you saying he could not, as Republican nominee, beat Barack Obama?" MITT ROMNEY: "No, what I'm saying is that what he just said, I think most people agree with, although the term Ponzi scheme I think is over the top and unnecessary and frightful to many people. But the real issue is in writing his book, Gov. Perry pointed out that in his view that Social Security is unconstitutional, that this is not something the federal government ought to be involved in, that instead it should be given back to the states. "And I think that view, and the view that somehow Social Security has been forced on us over the past 70 years that by any measure, again quoting book, by any measure Social Security has been a failure, this is after 70 years of tens of millions of people relying on Social Security, that's a very different matter." Romney's source? Perry's 2010 book, Fed Up! Our Fight to Save America from Washington. We pulled out our copy and found the correct passage. (Read more from PolitiFact about Perry's book.) Five pages into a section called, "Runaway Entitlement Spending," on Page 62, Perry writes: By any measure, Social Security is a failure. As author Jim Powell points out in FDR's Folly, one pro-FDR historian justified Social Security not on its merits but as an important "symbolic gesture to demonstrate that Roosevelt's heart was in the right place." This sounds a lot like justifying the current administration's policies because well-meaning politicians want to provide "hope." Now, if you say Social Security is a failure, as I have just done, you will inherit the wind of political scorn. Seniors might think you want to cut the benefits they have paid for. Politicians will seek to take advantage, stirring up fear about benefits that will be lost if you elect another "heartless Republican." I get it. That's why only retired senators chair entitlement commissions. We are told that no politician has the courage to raise these issues, even if avoiding them puts us on the fast track to financial run. But by remaining quiet, politicians are really saying they think the American people won't understand it if we share the grim details of our financial future, and that voters will simply kill -- or vote against -- the messenger in order to continue to receive an underfunded benefit that robbed them of the tens of thousands of dollars they should have made. Is that how we should respect our fellow citizens? So indeed, Perry said Social Security "is a failure;" he even acknowledged that doing so means he will "inherit the wind of political scorn." What did Perry mean by "the tens of thousands of dollars they should have made"? In the same section of the book he says payroll taxes would have been better left in workers' pockets: "If only the New Dealers had been kind enough to allow workers to make their own choice about whether to participate. As we know from experience, individuals would have done better on their own." He points out that "many private pension plans return 8 percent per year, compared to Social Security's paltry 2 percent or less." Then he offers the example of three Texas counties that opted out of Social Security for a private option before that door was shut in 1983. "Employees in those private plans, having exercised their liberty at Washington's sufferance, are reaping the benefits." He doesn't address Social Security's other roles, such as disability insurance and survivor's benefits, nor what he believes should happen to low-income workers who under Social Security draw more in retirement benefits then they're able to contribute in payroll taxes. Does Perry stand by his 2010 book? Less than a month ago he told a reporter in Des Moines, "I haven't backed off anything in my book. So read the book again and get it right." On Sept. 11, 2011, he clarified for USA Today, "As I said at the Reagan Library recently, Social Security benefits for current recipients and those nearing retirement must be protected. For younger workers, we must consider reforms to make Social Security financially viable." But Romney made it clear he was quoting from Perry's book. He said "In writing his book, Gov. Perry pointed out that … by any measure Social Security has been a failure." And indeed, in Perry's book, Fed Up!, he touts the benefits of private plans and says: "By any measure, Social Security is a failure." We rate Romney's statement True.

pomt-07609	The coalition of Arab states against Libya’s Moammar Gadhafi is the biggest coalition against a fellow Arab leader since the Persian Gulf War in 1990-1991.	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/mar/22/robin-wright/robin-wright-says-coalition-against-gadhafi-wides/	Shortly after the launch of air and missile attacks against Libya by an international alliance that included the United States, journalist Robin Wright sought to provide television viewers with some context for understanding the coalition of nations opposing Moammar Gadhafi, the alliance’s target. During a roundtable segment on the March 20, 2011, edition of ABC’s This Week with Christiane Amanpour, the host asked Wright -- a veteran diplomatic correspondent who’s now a scholar at the U.S. Institute of Peace -- whether Gadhafi is "crazy" and how secure his hold on power is. "He could prolong this for a very long time," Wright said. "This is not a man who plays by international rules, nor is he a man who thinks like even many of his counterparts in the Arab world, and that's why I think you've seen a great deal of unity in the Arab world against him. …" Amanpour interjected, "Which is really unusual, to have such a big Arab coalition against a fellow Arab leader." Wright agreed, saying, "And we haven't had one like this since the Iraq war back in 1990-1991. And that's what's, in fact, given the international community the legs. Without that, we probably would not be engaged." We wondered whether Wright was correct about the scope of Arab support for these alliances. So we looked into it. The Persian Gulf War The Persian Gulf War was waged to eject Iraqi troops from Kuwait, which had been invaded by Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein in August 1990. Thanks in large part to the diplomacy of then-President George H.W. Bush, a broad, international coalition was brought to bear against Hussein, and by the end of February 1991, allied troops had succeeded in pushing Iraqi troops out of Kuwait. Troops from several Arab states took part in ground combat, notably Egypt, Syria, Kuwait and Saudi Arabia. Several smaller states along the Persian Gulf also took part in the war either in combat roles or by providing logistics or base support -- Bahrain, Morocco, Oman, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates. The main exception among major Arab states was Jordan, which sided with Iraq. The Iraq War The next major conflict involving an Arab leader was the Iraq War, launched in 2003 by President George W. Bush with the aim of toppling Hussein, who had remained in power despite the 1990-1991 war. This conflict proved much more controversial internationally, and the Bush administration had little success signing up Arab support. Scott Althaus and Kalev Leetaru of the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign have recorded in great detail the shifting membership of the "coalition of the willing" -- the younger Bush’s list of Iraq War supporters, but we could only find one Arab nation on the list, Kuwait. Libya Following a wave of popular uprisings against entrenched leaders across the Arab world, rebellion sprang up in Libya, which had been ruled for decades by Gadhafi. The rebels scored some quick victories, but by mid March, forces loyal to Gadhafi began to gain back lost territory. Fears of wider bloodshed rose, and international diplomacy kicked into high gear. On March 12, 2011, the Arab League -- a group of nearly two dozen Arab nations that recently suspended Libya’s membership -- urged the United Nations to establish a "no-fly" zone aimed at crippling Gadhafi’s ability to strike the rebels from the air. On March 17, 2011, the U.N. Security Council complied, and the U.S., France and the United Kingdom drew up military plans. Attacks began on March 19. In addition to the Arab League’s support for the mission, at least two Arab nations -- Qatar and the United Arab Emirates -- have reportedly pledged tangible military assistance. On March 21, Al Jazeera reported that a French military spokesman had said that four Qatari jets were expected to take part in operations against Gadhafi. In addition, there are unconfirmed news reports that Egypt is letting arms shipments into the rebels in neighboring eastern Libya, but the Egyptian government -- which is in a transitional status following the ouster of longtime leader Hosni Mubarak in a popular revolution earlier this year -- has not made any official pledges of military support. Our conclusion Wright is correct that the Libya campaign represents the largest alignment of Arab states against a fellow Arab leader since the Persian Gulf War of 1990-1991. However, the significance of this fact is the subject of some debate. For starters, support for the Libyan situation is in flux. Just days after calling for the no-fly zone, the head of the Arab League, Amr Moussa, backtracked somewhat by expressing reservations about the risks of civilian deaths in the initial round of attacks. Later, in comments to reporters in Cairo, he reaffirmed support for the coalition’s efforts. Meanwhile, it remains to be seen whether more Arab nations will join the effort individually -- and whether troops take as significant a role in the Libyan operations as Arab troops did during the Persian Gulf War. In other words, it’s very early in the process, and Arab support could dissipate. On the other hand, even if the extent of military assistance by Arab states proves to be limited, experts told PolitiFact that the political and diplomatic consequences so far are by themselves notable. "I think Robin’s point is that Arab states have not lined up together, militarily or politically, against a fellow Arab leader like this since 1991," said Tom Malinowski, Washington director for Human Rights Watch. "They could have done so in other cases – in Sudan over Darfur, for example, or against Gadhafi at various points in the past, or even against Mubarak earlier this year. But they didn’t, and now they have. And I wouldn’t say that’s trivial." Stephen McInerney, executive director of the Project on Middle East Democracy, agreed, saying that the difference between the lack of Arab support for the Iraq War and the support for the situation in Libya is "extremely significant." The full history of this episode remains to be written. But at this early stage, we rate Wright’s statement True.

pomt-12968	"Since the Sandy Hook tragedy, more than seven children PER DAY have died from gun violence."	mostly true	/california/statements/2016/dec/27/jackie-speier/examining-claim-7-children-day-die-gun-violence/	U.S. Rep. Jackie Speier, D-San Mateo, is one of California’s most prominent advocates for gun control -- and one of the few members of Congress to personally experience and survive gun violence. Speier was shot five times at point blank range in 1978 on a trip accompanying Rep. Leo Ryan to Jonestown, the remote commune in Guyana where 909 people died from cyanide poisoning and other means. Speier was a legal adviser to Ryan, who along with four others were shot and killed in an ambush near the compound. Speier was rescued a day later. Since then, she’s spent much of her career in politics leading the call for gun safety. It was no surprise Speier spoke out against gun violence on Dec. 14, 2016, the fourth anniversary of the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting. The shooter killed 20 students, ages six and seven, along with six adult staff members in what’s considered the deadliest mass shooting at a school in U.S. history. On the anniversary, Speier posted an image on Twitter of herself holding a card reading #EndGunViolence. Above the image she claimed: "Since the Sandy Hook tragedy, more than seven children PER DAY have died from gun violence." We wanted to know whether the startling and somber statistic was true. We set out on a fact check. Our research A spokeswoman for Speier cited the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence as the source of the statistic. She said the campaign used information from an online database of fatal injury reports maintained by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. We did not hear back from a spokesman for the Brady Campaign. But we found a similar statistic on the organization’s website: "Every day, 7 children and teens die from gun violence." The website notes that it crunched CDC data for children and young people through age 19. The federal agency is considered a leading authority on mortality and injury statistics. It includes data through 2015. To examine Speier’s claim, we searched the database for the number of young people who died in connection with guns from the start of 2013 through 2015. Those are the most recent available years following the Sandy Hook shooting. We found 7,838 deaths in connection with firearms for people ages 0 through 19. That works out to 7.15 deaths a day during this three-year period -- which matches Speier’s claim of "more than seven" per day. These include all types of gun deaths from accidents to homicides to suicides. About 36 percent resulted from suicides. Some might take issue with Speier lumping in 18 year-olds and 19 year-olds as children. Gun deaths for these two ages accounted for nearly half of the 7,838 young people killed in the two-year period. Here’s a look at the breakdown of deaths by age group: 0-4 years: 247 5-9 years: 218 10-14 years: 847 15-19 years: 6,526 The National Institute of Justice, a research arm of the U.S. Department of Justice, has stated that young people aged 15 to 24 are the group most at risk for gun violence. If considering only elementary school aged children, the total who die in connection with guns would be roughly one every four days -- still a tragic number, but not close to seven per day. We interpreted Speier’s use of the word children, however, to include a broader group of young people, including teenagers. Our ruling California Congresswoman Jackie Speier recently claimed: "Since the Sandy Hook tragedy, more than seven children PER DAY have died from gun violence." Speier’s claim is backed up by the CDC’s fatal injury report data, which shows an average of 7.15 young people per day, aged 0 to 19, died in connection with firearms between 2013 and 2015. It’s important to note these include all types of gun deaths: accidents, homicides and suicides. All gun deaths are violent, but Speier’s statement could be interpreted as only including homicides or accidents. Finally, Speier’s claim might also lead some to think she’s talking about young school aged children, given that she invokes an elementary school shooting. The data show teenagers and young adults make up the vast majority of deaths due to guns in America, while elementary aged children account for a small fraction. The Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence, the source Speier relied on, offers a more complete look at this statistic on its website. It notes that children "and teens" are included in the seven deaths per day. Speier’s statement is on the right track. But it could have used some clarifications. We rate it Mostly True.

pomt-12957	"An estimated 8 million children worldwide live in orphanages or residential institutions. Shockingly, 80 percent of these children are not orphans."	half-true	/global-news/statements/2017/jan/04/lumos/jk-rowlings-charity-wants-end-orphanages-heres-why/	The good majority of orphans in institutions are not actually parentless, according to the charity founded by author J.K. Rowling. "An estimated 8 million children worldwide live in orphanages or residential institutions. Shockingly, 80 percent of these children are not orphans," says Lumos, a group dedicated to ending the institualization of children by 2050. "Children need families, not orphanages." Is it true? Well, maybe. The data Lumos relies on comes from credible sources, but the reality is the information available is outdated and, to some extent, unreliable. The number of orphans living in some institution -- the 8 million figure -- has been floating around for decades. It seems to originate from a 1985 report by Defence for Children International. A more recent tally by the United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF) pins the number at 2 million, but UNICEF cautions that this is likely to be severely underestimated due to underreporting as "many institutions are unregistered, and many countries do not regularly collect and report data on children in institutional care." The claim that 80 percent of children living in an institution are not orphans, meanwhile, comes from a 2009 estimate from Save the Children, an international children’s rights charity. The charity claims that "four out of five children in institutional care have one or both parents alive." These children are placed in orphanages despite having at least one living parent because of poverty or social exclusion (i.e. gender or disability discrimination). Neither figure can be verified without more comprehensive statistical studies than currently available, said Jedd Medefind, the president of the Christian Alliance for Orphans. Most studies are conducted on a local level and "these numbers vary greatly by individual orphanage as well as by region of the world," Medefind aid. UNICEF reports, for example, that 77 percent of more than 11,000 children in orphanages in Cambodia in 2009 had at least one living parent. In Sri Lanka, that number was 90 percent in 2007. On the low end, 39 percent of orphans in Zimbabwe had least one parent Here’s a map from Lumos that illustrates the regional differences. So what exactly is so troubling about having children with parents living in orphanages? Decades of research show that children, especially younger children, placed in institutional care are more likely to experience poor health, developmental delay and emotional attachment disorders. So rather than supporting institutions that have poor track records, UNICEF and virtually all children’s rights groups favor helping destitute families and communities provide care. While not all orphans can be returned to families or relatives, "we can say with confidence that a portion of the children currently living in orphanages could be returned to live with relatives with certain supports and appropriate oversight," Medefind said. In the United States, there were over 415,000 children in foster in 2014, according to the Department of Health and Human Services. Our ruling Lumos said, "An estimated 8 million children worldwide live in orphanages or residential institutions. Shockingly, 80 percent of these children are not orphans." Both figures are plausible though not verifiable. A UNICEF report estimated 2 million institutionalized orphans but noted that this is likely severely underestimated.

pomt-11610	"Road projects across the state are staying on track or getting done sooner thanks to the good work of the team at the Wisconsin Department of Transportation."	mostly false	/wisconsin/statements/2018/jan/26/scott-walker/checking-gov-walkers-claim-state-dot-ahead-game/	Given the perpetual orange barrels and accompanying traffic delays on Milwaukee area highways, drivers could be forgiven if they pounded the steering wheel after a recent tweet from Gov. Scott Walker. "Road projects across the state are staying on track or getting done sooner thanks to the good work of the team at the Wisconsin Department of Transportation," the governor tweeted Dec. 18, 2017. Responses from the Twitterverse showed not everyone was in the same lane: "Apparently the 94/45 interchange isn’t part of the state." "#WI: worst roads between the Rockies and Atlantic Ocean" "When is that zoo interchange supposed to be done again? 2018? 2019? 2020? . . . and counting." Let’s give this one a spin. Walker’s evidence Walker communications director Tom Evenson noted the governor’s tweet directly followed the announcement that the State Highway 441 project in the Fox Valley will be finishing in 2019, a year ahead of the previous expected date. "By combining projects on the WIS 441 project into a larger package for construction to bid, WisDOT anticipates more competitive bids, greater contractor efficiencies during construction and estimated saving of $9 million in project costs," Evenson said in an email. In addition, Evenson said, in April 2017, the governor announced that the Transportation Department freed up more than $100 million for additional projects to be advanced. This was a result, he said, of $65 million in savings over the course of the state fiscal year – due to lower gas prices and more competitive bids -- and an additional $38 million in available revenues to add to the Transportation Fund’s FY18 opening balance. Rebecca Kikkert, director of the Wisconsin Department of Transportation Office of Public Affairs, pointed PolitiFact Wisconsin to an April 13, 2017, state DOT announcement of the $38 million savings. "With let savings, WisDOT is able to do additional projects and move scheduled projects ahead advancing them, which enables the completion date for these projects to move ahead and get completed sooner," Kikkert said in an email. Putting on the brakes Craig Thompson, executive director of the Transportation Development Association of Wisconsin, a Madison-based group with a primary mission of outreach to the public, media, and decision-makers about the importance of an integrated transportation network, didn’t disagree with the evidence the Walker administration provided. However, Thompson cited a list of delayed projects, with several major ones among them: I-94 North-South between Kenosha and the Mitchell Interchange. Original scheduled completion: 2016. The completion date if the state receives an applied-for $246 million federal grant: 2021. The completion date without the federal grant: 2032. The state is still waiting to hear whether it will receive all, some or none of its request. I-94 East-West. The safety and congestion problems that prompted state transportation officials to plan the reconstruction and widening of I-94 between 16th and 70th streets in Milwaukee will not be dealt with now that the project has been abandoned. I-43 North-South (Silver Spring Drive. to Wis. 60), Glendale to Grafton - Milwaukee and Ozaukee counties. "This project has been put on hold until further notice," according to an October 2015 announcement on the Wisconsin Department of Transportation website. I-94 between U.S. Highway 12 and State Highway 65 (St. Croix County). Work on the federally-designated truck route between the Twin Cities and St. Croix County was included in the 2017-'19 budget by lawmakers, but vetoed by Walker. To be sure, Walker’s team highlighted cases where -- once contracts have been issued -- work was completed earlier than expected, while Thompson noted delayed by broader funding issues. That said, Walker’s tweet did not make such a distinction clear. It was a broad claim. And -- as many of the Twitter responses indicated -- that’s how many people understood it. Ex-DOT secretary waved caution flag Then-DOT Secretary Mark Gottlieb told state lawmakers at a December 2016 hearing that the conditions of Wisconsin’s highways would worsen if funding trends continue. Under Walker’s budget at the time, 21 percent of Wisconsin’s highway system was projected to be in poor condition by 2018, he said. By 2027, that number would grow to 42 percent. Gottlieb had at times called for increasing taxes and fees to pay for highways. Walker has said he won’t raise gas taxes or vehicle fees unless an equivalent cut is made in other taxes. Gottlieb stepped down less than a month after he told lawmakers Wisconsin’s roads would worsen under Walker's plans. In September 2017, Walker signed the two-year, $76 billion budget. It borrows $402 million for transportation infrastructure, far less than included in recent budgets. The plan delays work on Highway 15 in Outagamie County and the north leg of the Zoo Interchange in Milwaukee County and puts off the reconstruction of I-94 between the Zoo and Marquette interchanges. The reduction in funding for interstates in southeast Wisconsin did a U-turn with the announcement of Foxconn locating in southeast Wisconsin. The state is pinning its hopes for the expanded freeway and related work on a $246.2 million federal grant from the U.S. Department of Transportation that would pay for about half the remaining cost. Our rating In a tweet, Walker said "Road projects across the state are staying on track or getting done sooner thanks to the good work of the team at the Wisconsin Department of Transportation." A spokesman said Walker was referring to the early completion of the State Highway 441 project. But that was not specified in the tweet, and a wide range of other projects -- including major ones -- have been delayed. For a statement that is partially accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of context, we rate the claim Mostly False.

pomt-01649	Congress is on "vacation."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2014/aug/22/barack-obama/barack-obama-says-congress-was-going-vacation-eve-/	Last week, PolitiFact Texas gave a Mostly False rating to a claim by Gov. Rick Perry that Congress is "on a five-week vacation," noting that even if lawmakers take some days off, they continue to attend to their districts by holding town halls and other meetings. Not long after that fact-check appeared, a reader wrote in to ask us why we hadn’t taken President Barack Obama to task for using the same terminology to describe the congressional recess. We missed Obama’s comment the first time around, so we’ll check it here. In his weekly address on Aug. 2, 2014, Obama touted recent job gains and urged Congress to act on some of his proposals, including spending on infrastructure, raising the minimum wage, student-loan reforms, equal pay and paid leave. Such initiatives have been stalled in the House, currently controlled by the Republicans, and to an extent the Senate, where the GOP minority has tools it can use to block legislation. So Obama sought to paint congressional Republicans as being derelict in their duty by leaving town for the summer recess. "House Republicans actually got together this week and voted to sue me for taking actions on my own," Obama said. "And then they left town for the month without settling a bunch of unfinished business that matters to working families across America. … And when they return from vacation next month, instead of trying to pass partisan bills on party lines, hopefully we can come together with the sense of common purpose that you expect. And in the meantime, I will never stop doing whatever I can, whenever I can, not only to make sure that our economy succeeds, but that people like you succeed." The White House used the word again in the introduction to the transcript it sent to reporters, saying that "Congress is about to go on vacation." While Perry was referring to a different issue -- border security -- he expressed equal disgust at Congress leaving Washington. "Congress shouldn’t be on a five-week vacation," Perry said. "I can assure you that drug cartels and gangs are not on vacation." We don’t see any significant differences in the context of the two politicians’ uses of the word "vacation," so we’ll recap here what PolitiFact Texas found when it talked to congressional experts and apply it to Obama’s comment. (The White House did not respond to our inquiry for this article.) A 1970 law mandates annual recess The annual August break is required by law, according to an Aug. 6, 2014, Wall Street Journal blog post by Linda Killian, a senior scholar at the Wilson Center, a think tank. The Legislative Reorganization Act of 1970, she wrote, directs the House and Senate to recess for the month of August, until after Labor Day. The act says that unless Congress provides otherwise, the House and Senate shall adjourn no later than July 31 of each year or so and, it looks to us, to remain adjourned to the second day after Labor Day. (It does say the mandate shall not be applicable in any year there’s a state of war as declared by Congress as of July 31.) This year, Congress started its five-week summer recess on Aug. 1, 2014. Is the recess a vacation? It’s one thing not to be in session, but is that the same as taking a vacation? First, there’s the Merriam-Webster dictionary definition of vacation: a "period of time that a person spends away from home, school, or business usually in order to relax or travel." Just because it’s called a recess doesn’t mean congressional leaders are taking a break. "Business still goes on," Senate Historian Don Ritchie told Time magazine. "There’s just no action on the floor." Scant business goes on, we suspect, though an official House calendar listed a few hearings scheduled during the 2014 recess — an Aug. 6 hearing of the House Committee on Veterans Affairs on health care access in rural America, hosted by panel Chairman Jeff Miller, R-Fla.; an Aug. 7 hearing of the House Subcommittee on Africa, Global Health, Global Human Rights and International Organizations about combating the Ebola threat; and an Aug. 14 hearing, also by the veterans affairs panel, on rural health care and infrastructure needs. Time’s story said: "Especially because this is an election year, many members will be campaigning, visiting offices and town halls in their home states and holding town meetings. Offices will stay open to receive mail and calls from constituents. Members who aren’t up for reelection might enjoy family time or a vacation," the story said. PolitiFact Texas found many members who held or planned to hold official appearances, outreach sessions with voters and the like during the recess period. The American Enterprise Institute’s Norman Ornstein, a longtime congressional observer, said that during recesses, most senators and House members "use this time to travel to trouble spots or to go back and campaign or do meetings in their home districts or states. They are not laying back in the sun, but working. I would prefer more time in Washington legislating, and less time back in the district. But calling this a five-week vacation is a distortion." Obama’s own vacation Meanwhile, we’d be remiss if we didn’t note that Obama himself hasn’t exactly been huddled, monk-like, in the Oval Office this August. He left with his family for a vacation in Martha’s Vineyard, Mass., on Aug. 9, then returned to Washington for about 48 hours before resuming his vacation. The Obamas’ time away came during an unusually intense news period that included unrest in Ferguson, Mo., the launch of U.S. airstrikes against the Islamic extremist group ISIS, the beheading of American journalist James Foley by ISIS, and the spread of the Ebola virus in West Africa -- pairings that were not lost on many of the president’s critics, as well as some of his supporters. For instance, the New York Times quoted Jim Manley, a veteran Democratic strategist, saying, "As a general rule, I think that he’s right that you can’t be held hostage to the news cycle — the man deserves a bit of downtime," said. "But in this particular instance, I think a lot of Democrats flinched a little bit. … (The video of the beheading) was just so shocking that the idea that he was going to immediately run to the golf course was just a little too much for folks. It was tone-deaf." For the record, CBS White House reporter Mark Knoller, the unofficial chronicler of presidential travels, reports that Obama has taken 19 vacations totaling 125 days so far while in office. That’s far fewer than George W. Bush’s 65 combined trips to his Texas ranch and his parents’ home in Kennebunkport, Maine, which totaled 407 days at the same point in his presidency. A president, Knoller tweeted, "is never really on ‘vacation.’ The job and responsibilities go with him wherever he is." This suggests that Obama should know better than to label Congress’ August recess with the broad brush of "vacation." Our ruling Obama said Congress is on "vacation." Hypocrisy aside -- Obama was about to go on vacation himself just a week later -- he’s stretching it on the terminology. During Congress’ August recess -- mandated by a 1970 law -- lawmakers aren’t debating matters on the floor of the House or Senate. But even if they take some dog days off, the recess isn’t a no-work vacation. Lawmakers continue to attend to their districts by holding town halls and other meetings, and many also campaign. On balance, we rate Obama’s claim the same as Perry’s -- Mostly False.	None	Barack Obama	None	None	None	2014-08-22T13:54:56	2014-08-02	['None']
pomt-08203	"Over the course of one four-year term, it costs taxpayers more than $1 million simply to operate" the governor’s mansion.	true	/wisconsin/statements/2010/nov/21/bob-wirch/state-sen-bob-wirch-says-it-costs-wisconsin-taxpay/	The governor’s mansion -- a kingly abode for the governor and his family, right? Don’t think like a peasant. It is so much more. "Executive residences," as the National Governors Association calls them, are "regarded as an important symbol of the state’s culture and heritage. As state treasures, executive residences provide an appropriate setting for official state entertaining and are often highly valued as a venue for community functions." Oh. The NGA goes on: "Given the critical role executive residences play in official state and cultural activities, considerable care is required in managing, staffing and maintaining the executive residence." Gee, sounds like that could get kinda expensive. Just how much does it cost taxpayers to run the Wisconsin governor’s mansion -- ahem, executive residence? Too much, says state Sen. Bob Wirch, a Democrat from Pleasant Prairie in Kenosha County. Echoing a call he made in 2002, when Democratic Gov. Jim Doyle was elected, Wirch wants Republican Governor-elect Scott Walker to sell or lease the 34-room manor. "Over the course of one four-year term," Wirch claimed in a news release Nov. 15, 2010, "it costs taxpayers more than $1 million simply to operate." Wirch also noted Walker’s own call to citizens for ideas on how to make state government run more efficiently. After all, with a structural deficit, lost revenue because of a state Supreme Court decision and other issues, the new governor faces a projected shortfall of $3 billion for the 2011-’13 budget. "It is hard to set a good example," Wirch said in his statement, "if you are living in a mansion." Walker, who will be inaugurated Jan. 3, 2011, plans to move with his family from Wauwatosa into the residence, said his spokesman, Cullen Werwie. He said Walker has no comment on Wirch’s recommendation to sell or lease the mansion, which is perched on the shores of Lake Mendota. The home’s "replacement value" is $1.63 million, according to the state Department of Administration. But Wirch believes that with its 3.7 acres of land, the estate is worth more than $2.5 million. Perhaps, like us, you’ve never been to the mansion (although you can see it in pictures). Well, according to the Department of Administration, the state Historical Society and the office of first lady Jessica Doyle, it: Is a three-story, 21,000-square-foot (including basement) Georgian Revivalin Maple Bluff, a village northeast of Madison. Was built in 1921 for Madison industrialist Carl A. Johnson and became home to governors after being purchased by the state in 1949. Has 13 bathrooms, seven bedrooms, seven fireplaces and seven garden areas. Nice. So, who takes care of it? Seven employees, according to Vicki Heymann, the mansion’s residence director. Full-timers include Heymann, a chef, a gardener and a "facilities maintenance specialist." The part-timers are a housekeeper, a "laundress and flower arranger," and the head of the waitstaff, who has worked at the mansion for more than 32 years. OK, now let’s get to Wirch’s claim that operating the mansion costs more than $1 million during a four-year term. Wirch’s office said the state Legislative Fiscal Bureau put the operating costs at $265,000 per year. That would come to $1.06 million over four years. The senator’s per-year number is a touch high, but his four-year figure of more than $1 million is on target. The fiscal bureau told PolitiFact Wisconsin that the mansion’s operating expenses are budgeted at $262,500 in 2009-’10 and the same amount for 2010-’11, nearly all of which is salaries. That’s a total of $1.05 million over four years. In fact, actual expenditures are running higher, according to the state Department of Administration. They were $290,462 in 2008-’09 and $273,340 in 2009-’10. If that were carried out over four years, the total would be $1.13 million. Wisconsin is one of 44 states that provided a governor’s residence as of 2004, according to the most recent survey done by the National Governors Association. Here’s how three of the other six treat their governors: Rhode Island doesn’t have a mansion -- and probably doesn’t need one. You can drive across the state in an hour, said Amy Kempe, spokeswoman for the governor. Idaho had a governor’s residence, then didn’t, then did again when one was donated by a billionaire potato magnate. Gov. C.L. "Butch" Otter had been receiving a monthly housing allowance of more than $4,000. But Otter stopped taking the money in March 2009 when the 7,400-square-foot Idaho House became available and he opted to continue commuting from his ranch, his spokesman said. California’s governors are on their own, because the state doesn’t provide a residence or a housing allowance, said Joe Wolfenden, senior guide at the California Governor’s Mansion. Now a state park destination, the mansion was last used by a governor in 1967, when Ronald Reagan lived there for three months before moving to a home that had been purchased by friends. OK, let’s bring all this mansion talk home. In calling on Governor-elect Scott Walker to save taxpayer dollars, state Sen. Bob Wirch said selling or leasing the governor’s mansion would enable the state to cut more than $1 million over four years on the cost of operating the mansion. Based on the latest budget and expenditure figures, the operating costs do exceed $1 million over four years. We rate Wirch’s statement True.

pomt-12004	"Roy Moore fought for pay increases for politicians while courts had to shut down because of lack of funding."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2017/sep/22/luther-strange/did-roy-moore-fight-pay-raises-politicians-during-/	Sen. Luther Strange, R-Ala., claims his opponent Roy Moore sought pay raises for politicians while the Alabama courts shut down due to a budget shortfall. "FACT: Roy Moore fought for pay increases for politicians while courts had to shut down because of lack of funding," reads a claim on the Strange for Senate website. Strange and Moore face off in a Sept. 26 runoff vote for the Republican nomination to fill the Senate seat vacated by Jeff Sessions, now the attorney general. Is it a fact that Moore fought for pay increases for politicians while courts shut down? We delved into the recent history of Alabama’s court system to find out. Did Moore fight to give pay raises to two staffers? The Strange for Senate website contains a footnote saying the pay raises went to "two of (Moore’s) top political staffers." The website also cites an Associated Press article from April 26, 2002, when Moore served as chief justice of the Alabama Supreme Court, an elected position. "Chief Justice Roy Moore gave pay raises to two of his top administrators this year as the state court system headed toward financial problems resulting in 170 layoffs," reads the article, which goes on to identify the pay raise recipients by name: Moore gave state court administrator Rich Hobson a 5 percent merit raise from $99,538 to $104,587 annually. Scott Barnett, a lawyer who acts as spokesman for the court system, got a 2.5 percent merit raise in January that boosted his pay from $72,103 annually to $73,881, according to records kept by the Retirement System of Alabama. Both men were appointed by Moore after he was elected chief justice in November 2000. When we reached out to Barnett, now an Alabama attorney in private practice, he disputed the notion that Moore was personally involved in giving him a pay raise in 2002. Barnett said it was a department head — not Moore — who recommended his merit raise. "Judge Moore was not, to my knowledge, personally involved in decisions to grant merit pay raises to Administrative Office of Courts employees," Barnett said. "The Alabama Administrative Office of Courts has its own personnel department that manages such issues." Barnett said that given the chief justice’s role as the administrative head of the state's judicial system, it’s unrealistic to think Moore would become involved in granular details like pay raises for individual court employees. Barnett added that, to the best of his knowledge, Moore would not even have needed to approve his pay raise. We contacted two employees at Alabama’s Administrative Office of Courts who corroborated Barnett’s belief that Moore would not have needed to approve his pay raise. "The chief justice would not have to approve a pay raise given to an employee, including a staff attorney, of the Administrative Office of Courts," Nathan Wilson, the assistant administrative director of courts and legal director of Alabama’s Administrative Office of Courts, said in an email. (Officially, Barnett was staff attorney with the Alabama Administrative Office of Courts.) While Barnett received a 2.5 percent pay increase, he was eligible for 5 percent. This raises the question: If Chief Justice Moore had in fact "fought for" Barnett’s raise, as Strange alleges, why did Barnett receive less than the full 5 percent increase? Barnett said he took issue with the amount at the time, and chalked it up to differences of opinion with his boss, the court’s legal director — a position which we’d note is subordinate to the chief justice. With regard to Hobson, the other pay-raise recipient in question, court officials said his raise would have been approved by Moore. We contacted Hobson, who now works as a consultant for Moore’s Senate campaign. He said that while his pay raise did require Moore’s approval, merit-based raises were "standard operating procedure for deserving employees" across the whole of Alabama’s state government, which had some 34,500 employees in 2002, including some 2,500 judicial branch employees. We found that nearly half of Alabama state government employees received a raise in 2002. That year, more than 15,000 state employees received a 5 percent merit raise, while another 1,300 received 2.5 percent merit raises, according to the Associated Press. Hobson called it a distortion to say Moore "fought" to give him a pay raise. "It’s just not true," he said. "I got a raise like everybody else who deserved one got a raise that year." Were the pay raise recipients 'politicians'? We contacted several election law experts and political scientists to ask if court employees like Hobson and Barnett are considered "politicians." The answer? A resounding "no." "My understanding of a politician is someone who either holds or runs for elected office, or is an official of a political party," said James A. Gardner, a law professor at SUNY Buffalo Law School. "I would not count civil servants as ‘politicians.’ Court administrators are civil servants." Richard Fording, a political science professor at the University of Alabama, said "no reasonable person would refer to them as politicians." Alabama court officials told us appointees of the Administrative Office of Courts are considered "state employees." Both Barnett and Hobson told us they considered themselves court employees, not politicians. Did the pay raises coincide with the court shutdown? The Strange for Senate website states that Moore fought for the pay raises during a court shutdown. (As an aside, we’d note the differing language in the website footnote, which says Moore fought for the raises "while budget difficulties confronted the courts.") To analyze this element of the claim requires some stage-setting. In 2002, a budget battle over Alabama court funding pitted the state’s Democratically-controlled legislature and governor against Moore. As the administrative head of the state's judicial system, Moore had requested $124.7 million from Alabama lawmakers. Instead, they approved $122 million, $2.7 million shy of Moore’s request. The legislature ended its regular session on April 17 without appropriating the extra money Moore sought. The next day, Moore’s staff announced cost-cutting measures, including the curtailment of jury trials for five months. Notably, the Associated Press reported around this time that Moore "told judges to continue merit raises promised through April 19," even as he ordered spending cuts. However, Alabama court officials said judicial branch merit raises were frozen after April 19. We asked the Strange campaign if its claim applied to other pay raises than those given to Hobson and Barnett; a campaign aide indicated their claim concerned only those two employees. On May 2, Moore ordered jury trials to resume, saying $500,000 in emergency funding provided by the governor would suffice. Jury trials resumed in June, according to the Birmingham News. (For his part, Hobson said he doesn’t recall any jury trials actually being suspended, though we weren’t able to independently verify this.) Either way, to the extent that Alabama courts were "shut down," as the Strange campaign claims, it would have been from late April to some time in June 2002. Both Barnett and Hobson say their pay raises came in January of that year, months before the budget fight reached a crescendo in spring. A spokeswoman for the Moore campaign backed up Hobson’s claim that his pay bump came in January, though we were not able to independently verify the timing. An Associated Press article, citing records from the Retirement System of Alabama, corroborated Barnett’s claim that his raise came in January. Our ruling The Strange campaign said, "Roy Moore fought for pay increases for politicians while courts had to shut down because of lack of funding." Of the two pay raises at issue, Moore only needed to approve one. The notion that he needed to fight for these raises is undercut by the fact that nearly half of Alabama state government employees got raises that year. In any event, experts we spoke to unanimously agreed the two pay raise recipients were not "politicians." To the extent that Alabama courts experienced a shutdown in 2002, it occurred months after at least one of the raises had been approved, and after Moore had publicly advocated for more funding for courts. We rate this False. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com	None	Luther Strange	None	None	None	2017-09-22T11:51:37	2017-08-29	['None']
pomt-02582	"25% of human trafficking victims are located in Texas."	pants on fire!	/texas/statements/2014/jan/29/john-cornyn/john-cornyn-claim-misinterprets-outdated-human-tra/	U.S. Sen. John Cornyn recently wrote: "January is National Slavery and Human Trafficking Prevention Month, a sobering reminder that even as we enter the year 2014, people around the world continue to be victims of slavery and human trafficking. "Tragically, these horrendous crimes are occurring at an alarming rate in our own state," the Texas Republican said. "25% of human trafficking victims are located in Texas." The email went on to mention Cornyn’s introduction of legislative proposals to "help law enforcement track down and prosecute these criminals, and provide support for the victims of these crimes." Merriam-Webster defines human trafficking as "organized criminal activity in which human beings are treated as possessions to be controlled and exploited (as by being forced into prostitution or involuntary labor)." Are one in four of all trafficking victims located in Texas? Megan Mitchell, a spokeswoman for Cornyn, who seeks election to a third term, told us by email that the senator relied on an undated "fact sheet" from the Texas Sex Trafficking Obliteration Project, overseen by the conservative Concerned Women of America, and a Sept. 16, 2009, report by Texas-based Children at Risk, a nonprofit focused on the "root causes of poor public policies affecting children." The sheet says: "25% of all human trafficking victims are in Texas," attributing that without elaboration to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. ‘Certified’ victims only The Children at Risk report gives detail, stating: "In the last quarter of 2007, 30% of the calls received by the National Human Trafficking Hotline originated in Texas and 25% of all international victims certified by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services were located in Texas. As of the date (of) publication, the National Human Trafficking Hotline receives more calls from Texas than from any other state." According to the report, Texas is a "hub for international human trafficking because of its many busy interstate highways, international airports, bus stations, the shipping commerce through the Gulf of Mexico, and its shared border with Mexico… Texas is also a hotspot for domestic human trafficking because cities such as Dallas, Houston and Austin have many runaway and homeless youth." By email, Dawn Lew, a staff attorney for Children at Risk, told us the reference to the last quarter of 2007 applied only to the hotline calls and said the 25 percent reference reflected the percentage of all international trafficking victims "certified" by the HHS who were located in Texas from April 2004 through January 2006. Also, Lew pointed us toward a web page for the federal Office of Refugee Resettlement, dated Oct. 2, 2012, stating that under the Trafficking Victims Protection Act of 2000, adult victims of severe forms of trafficking in the country from another place can become eligible for federal and state services otherwise offered to refugees. To qualify, individuals must be "certified" as trafficking victims by HHS, according to the web page, meaning they must: be a victim of a severe form of trafficking; be willing to assist in every reasonable way in the investigation and prosecution of severe forms of trafficking or be unable to cooperate due to physical or psychological trauma; and have cleared immigration paperwork hurdles. Child victims do not need such certification, the page says. Lew subsequently noted a July 2012 federal report stating that in 2002, certification letters for 99 individuals were sent to benefit-issuing offices in 14 states. The report said: "The largest concentrations of victims were located in Texas (31.3%), Florida (19.2%), and California (14.1%)." Another Children at Risk official called and said Cornyn’s statement could have been worded differently. The official, Mandi Kimball, later said by email that Cornyn’s 25 percent reference was in the context of talking up his legislation targeting trafficking within the United States. "We have no idea how many people are being trafficked in Texas or any state for that matter," Kimball wrote. "We do know that 25% of the" foreign "victims located and certified in the country from April 2004-January 2006 were located in Texas. Cornyn is not saying that 25% of the victims were being trafficked in Texas, he stated that they were located in Texas. This is the 25% number that people are going by, because it is the only concrete data and number we have to go by, and this data is from" HHS. Do these counts add up? Generally, Lew said earlier, states are under-estimating trafficking victims. "This is because it is difficult and nearly impossible to quantify the true number of victims," Lew said. "Why? Because victims often don’t self-identify as victims, some are misidentified and charged as criminals for related offenses (drugs, criminal trespass, etc.), and others, due to the clandestine nature of human trafficking, are hiding in plain sight and may never encounter law enforcement or social service providers," Lew wrote. "In addition, although human trafficking has always existed, until recently, not all states even had a state law on human trafficking, which contributes to the lack of information at the state level on the number of victims identified, traffickers convicted, etc.," Lew said. "Certification numbers are some of the only concrete data that we have with respect to the number of human trafficking victims in each state, and it’s clear that many of the victims are being certified from Texas. Again, keep in mind that certification only captures a percentage of international victims, and does not include domestic victims at all. So the problem in Texas, as in most every state, is larger." At Lew’s suggestion, we reached Maria Trujillo, executive director of the Houston Rescue and Restore Coalition, which says its mission is educate the public, train professionals and empower the community to act toward identifying, rescuing and restoring trafficking victims to freedom. By phone, Trujillo said the Cornyn-cited statistic may have held up in 2006--though then solely for adult victims from outside the United States, since certification does not sweep in citizen-victims. Also, she said, the government has not released figures since then that would bring the estimate up to date. After 2006, Trujillo said, the government stopped estimating the number of certified adult victims on a state-by-state level, though national figures continued to be available. Kenneth Wolfe, spokesman for the Administration for Children and Families, which is an HHS agency, told us by email that it is unable to calculate how many victims of human trafficking are in the United States or within any state. Wolfe said the agency has not lately reported which states got the most letters certifying international victims "because the information might be misinterpreted as the location of the trafficking, which is often not the case." Nationally in the fiscal year that ran through September 2011, he said, such letters were provided to victims or their representatives in 38 states. Certified victims, he said, came from 55 countries. Texas vs. the world We were curious to see how the scope of trafficking in Texas stacks up with other places in the world, some of them notorious for human trafficking. Cornyn’s statement, after all, said that 25 percent of trafficking victims are in Texas just one sentence after he said that "people around the world continue to be victims of slavery and human trafficking." Globally, Trujillo said, the only recent estimate of trafficking victims that she recommends came from the International Labour Federation, a United Nations agency, which estimated there were nearly 21 million victims in 2012. "I am comfortable with that figure, I am comfortable with their research," Trujillo said. "... It is still an estimate. No one can ever know the true number because it is such a covert crime." A U.N. report published in December 2012 describes the organization’s estimate of 20.9 million individuals in forced labor, including for sexual exploitation. "While it is not known how many of these victims were trafficked, the estimate implies that currently, there are millions of trafficking-in-persons victims in the world," the report says, further specifying that per U.S. State Department figures, there were 449 adults and 92 children from foreign countries certified as U.S. victims of trafficking in the fiscal year that ran through September 2010. The U.N. agency’s executive summary describes the survey-based methodology for its estimate, also saying that Asia accounts for 56 percent of the estimated global total with Africa accounting for 18 percent of victims. "Developed economies" including the United States, the summary says, account for 1.5 million, or 7 percent, of the victims. Informed of the unavailability of recent estimates and the fact that the original estimate was limited to certified victims from outside the country, Mitchell of Cornyn’s office said by email that his statement relied on the "most recent Texas-specific data available." Our ruling Cornyn said 25 percent of trafficking victims are located in Texas. This claim seemingly draws on an outdated percentage for a subset of the planet’s trafficking victims, that is, "certified" adult victims from outside the U.S. described some five years ago as located in Texas from April 2004 through January 2006--and that calculation did not account for U.S. citizen-victims. We did not find an estimate of the share of the world’s trafficking victims located in Texas, though the 2012 U.N. estimate seems to show that Texas is not home to a huge share; victims are more prevalent in Asia and Africa than in the developed world, the report said. All told, this claim shakes out as incorrect and ridiculous. Pants on Fire! PANTS ON FIRE – The statement is not accurate and makes a ridiculous claim.

pomt-10849	"John Kerry was at 4 percent in the polls in December of 2003...and he ended up becoming the nominee of the party."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2007/sep/07/chris-dodd/cherry-picked-numbers-dont-tell-full-story/	In a discussion about his endorsement by the International Association of Firefighters, Dodd likened himself to John Kerry in the 2004 campaign to suggest that Dodd could still win the nomination: "John Kerry was at 4 percent in the polls in December of 2003, two points behind Al Sharpton and 22 points behind Howard Dean. And he ended up becoming the nominee of the party," he said Wednesday, August 29, 2007, on CNN's The Situation Room. We find it's not a fair comparison. Dodd is not only understating Kerry's strength in the polls, but overstating his own. First, his subtraction was off, which the Dodd campaign acknowledged in an e-mail to us last week. Dodd was citing a Dec. 10-13, 2003, CBS/New York Times poll. It showed Kerry at 4 percent, behind Al Sharpton at 6 and Dean at 23 (The subtraction error was that Kerry was 19 percentage points behind Dean, not 22 points as Dodd said). Dodd chose to cite polls that showed Kerry at an especially low point — 4 percent. Indeed, there were four polls showing Kerry at that level. But other polls that same month showed Kerry with more support. There were other polls that had him between 5 and 8 percent, and two that had him at 10 percent. Dodd's biggest stretch is his attempt to liken his poll standing to Kerry. In most polls conducted this year that include him, Dodd registers at 1 percent. He's topped out at 2 percent about five times. Even Carol Moseley Braun polled better in 2004. And anyway, does Dodd really want to be comparing himself to Kerry?

pomt-14202	"When I withdrew in June of 2008, polls were showing that at least 40 percent of my supporters said, oh, they weren't going to support Sen. Obama."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/apr/21/hillary-clinton/hillary-clinton-history-shows-win-bernie-sanders/	As the list of states that haven’t voted yet dwindles, Democrats are pondering how Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders will be able to unify their supporters in advance of November’s general election. Party strategists have worried that aggressive sparring during the New York primary is fraying relations between Clinton, Sanders, and their respective supporters. Polling evidence suggests that there may be reason for such a worry: An April McClatchy-Marist poll found that 25 percent of Sanders supporters said they would not back Clinton as the Democratic nominee, compared to 69 percent who said they would support her. Another 6 percent were unsure. Clinton addressed this during an April 21, 2016, town hall with ABC’s Good Morning America, comparing it to her 2008 primary bid against Barack Obama. "When I withdrew in June of 2008, polls were showing that at least 40 percent of my supporters said, oh, they weren't going to support Sen. Obama," Clinton said at the televised town hall. In other words, Clinton argued, if Obama can come back from even sharper divisions to win the presidency, then she can, too. We looked into the polling archive to see if she has a good argument. We found two polls taken in June 2008 that asked primary supporters of Clinton who they would support with Obama as the Democratic nominee. Here’s the summary: Pollster Month Will support Obama Will support McCain Won’t vote/ Other McCain support plus won’t vote/other CNN/Opinion Research June 60 17 22 39 ABC News/ Washington Post June 62 25 13 38 So Clinton has a point: In both polls, roughly 60 percent of former Clinton supporters backed Obama, while 40 percent didn’t, either through a vote for Republican nominee John McCain or a vow to do something other than voting for Obama. This means Clinton can take heart that she is already doing about 10 points better securing the backing of Sanders voters than Obama was doing securing support from Clinton backers. We have one small caveat: While the polls from 2008 and 2016 are similar in topic, their wording is slightly different. The 2016 Marist poll uses terminology that’s a bit vague -- the choices are "support her" or "not support her." By contrast, the 2008 CNN poll was more specific, looking at whether people would vote for Obama, vote for Republican nominee John McCain, or wouldn’t vote at all. Subsequent polling data showed Obama did eventually win the support of Clinton backers. By August 2008, polls showed that Obama was winning 70 percent to 76 percent of Clinton supporters. And of course, Obama went on to win in November. Our ruling Clinton said, "When I withdrew in June of 2008, polls were showing that at least 40 percent of my supporters said, oh, they weren't going to support Sen. Obama." The wording of polls makes exact comparisons a bit tricky, but in general, Clinton is right about the scale of Obama’s 2008 problem with dissident Democrats -- and correct that Obama had a harder road then than she seems to have now.

This is way beyond what happened in the nation during this period of time.	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2007/oct/26/rudy-giuliani/hes-got-his-numbers-right/	At a speech to the Manhattan Institute in New York City with Louis Freeh, the former director of the FBI, former New York Mayor Rudolph Giuliani bragged, as he often dows, about his crime-fighting prowess. "Fifty-six percent decline in overall crime. A 73 percent decline in motor-vehicle theft. A 67 percent decline in robbery. A 66 percent decline in murder. This is way beyond what happened in the nation during this period of time." During his eight years in office, federal records do show that rates of violent and property crime in New York dropped as sharply as he claims. It is also true that those rates of decline outpaced national averages, and that New York boasted a low violent crime rate compared to the biggest big cities, like Los Angeles and Houston. But his claims do come with some caveats: Numerous studies have failed to show that the politicies of Giuiliani and his police commanders were directly responsible for the decline in crime. Crime rates dropped nationwide during those years, 1994-2001, and most large cities saw significant declines; San Francisco, in fact, enjoyed the steepest drop in violent crime. And, significantly, violent crime rates in New York City had been falling for three years before he took office.	None	Rudy Giuliani	None	None	None	2007-10-26T00:00:00	2007-05-31	['None']
pomt-03327	"Gangs have increased by 40 percent since this president was elected."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2013/jul/24/newt-gingrich/newt-gingrich-says-gangs-have-increased-40-percent/	More than a week after a Florida jury found George Zimmerman not guilty in the shooting death of teenager Trayvon Martin, CNN’s State of the Union hosted a roundtable that included a discussion of crime and race in America. Among the panelists was Newt Gingrich, the former Republican House speaker from Georgia. "Gangs have increased by 40 percent since this president was elected," Gingrich said. "There is no federal program to stop it. No one wants to have an honest conversation about it." It wasn’t the first time Gingrich had made this point. In an op-ed, Gingrich wrote, "Although the president does not acknowledge the gangs' role as a major cause of the epidemic of violence, the FBI does. The FBI estimated in 2011 that there are roughly 1.4 million active gang members in the U.S., an astonishing 40 percent increase from 2009. These gangs, the FBI says, are responsible for ‘an average of 48 percent of violent crime in most jurisdictions, and much higher in others.’ " We were able to locate the FBI study Gingrich referred to in the op-ed -- the 2011 National Gang Threat Assessment. Gingrich accurately quoted the report, which said, "Approximately 1.4 million active street, (outlaw motorcycle) and prison gang members, comprising more than 33,000 gangs, are criminally active" in the United States, which "represents a 40 percent increase from an estimated 1 million gang members in 2009." (The 1 million figure came from the 2009 edition of the same FBI study.) Because Gingrich’s 40 percent figure comes from federal statistics, we agree that it has some credibility. But we will raise two issues of concern. Uncertainty about the statistics Because gang activity is illegal, it’s difficult to get solid numbers. So the FBI estimated as best it could. To do this, the FBI used a combination of data from a survey of law enforcement agencies by the National Drug Intelligence Center, along with additional interviews with law enforcement officials. The survey the FBI used randomly sampled roughly 3,000 state and local law enforcement agencies to gauge how prevalent gangs are in their jurisdiction. This is a reasonable approach to tackling a challenging question, but it’s not gospel. Criminologists warned PolitiFact to be wary of several factors. • The survey is not just an estimate -- it’s an estimate of estimates. All surveys are subject to sampling error -- that is, the possibility that the people being surveyed aren’t actually random, thus biasing the results. But at least many surveys sample something that the respondent will find easy to quantify -- say, whether they approve of the job President Obama is doing, or how many cars they own. The survey the FBI used, however, has uncertainty not just about whether the sample was truly random, but also about whether the answers given are actually accurate. The report itself "acknowledges that there may be some duplication or underreporting of gang members" because of how each state and local law enforcement agency measures gang activity in their area. • The smell test. A jump of 40 percent in just two years is an enormous increase, said James Alan Fox, a criminologist at Northeastern University. "If there were really a 40 percent increase in two years, you would see a big impact on crime statistics generally, but we haven’t," he said. "Crime rates are fairly level." • Who counts as a gang member? There’s no universal definition of who counts as a gang member. "Actual gang members can deny membership, and wanna-bes can claim membership," said Eugene O’Donnell, a criminologist at the John Jay College of Criminal Justice. "In both cases it is difficult to discern for sure." • Institutional bias. Local law enforcement officials have an interest in overstating -- or at least not understating -- the number of gang members in their jurisdiction, since a bigger gang problem can help them secure more federal assistance, O’Donnell said. This wouldn’t be so much of a problem for the soundness of the data if an independent assessment was also factored in, but none is. The estimate is based solely upon the opinions of state and local law-enforcement officials. All in all, O’Donnell said, "there are multiple grounds for being skeptical" about the estimate. Making significant public policy decisions based on them would be manifestly unsound." Does Obama deserve blame? Gingrich said, "Gangs have increased by 40 percent since this president was elected." If he had said "between 2009 and 2011," we wouldn’t have addressed the issue of whether he was blaming the president. But Gingrich chose to use Obama’s presidency to mark time. The Gingrich camp firmly disagrees that the former House speaker was blaming Obama for an increase in gang activity. They point to previous op-eds -- including the one we mentioned earlier -- as evidence that Gingrich was simply saying that crime issues that inspire a lot of media attention -- such as mass shootings and the Martin case -- obscure a more far-reaching crime concern, gangs. "Newt mentioned Obama to make that contrast – in other words, ‘Is a Trayvon Martin-type occurrence really what is most important to be focused on when it comes to the personal safety of African-Americans?’" said Joe DeSantis, a spokesman for Gingrich. "After all, the president had just held a press conference to talk about the Martin verdict. Newt did not say that Obama was to blame for the increase in gang violence." The Gingrich camp is correct that he has made that argument in previous op-eds, but we didn’t see him mentioning it in the CNN discussion. And because a CNN viewer most likely wouldn’t have read Gingrich’s past op-eds, we think it’s fair to rate him in part for bringing Obama into the discussion of gang growth. There are, in fact, some things that an administration can do to bolster law enforcement generally and gang activity specifically. Contrary to Gingrich’s claim that "there is no federal program to stop" gangs, the Justice Department does have an Organized Crime and Gang Section, which was established under Obama in late 2010 as a consolidation of several existing offices. However, while federal funding and technical assistance can help, Fox said that "there’s relatively little that the president can do to discourage a 12-year-old from joining a gang." Most gang activity is handled by local law enforcement departments, and both demographics, including the number of young people in an area, and economic conditions are important drivers of gang membership. "Gangs are always hiring, even when legitimate employers aren’t because the economy is in bad shape," Fox said. And in recessions, he added, "younger, inner-city people are hit especially hard." Our ruling Gingrich said that "gangs have increased by 40 percent since this president was elected." Gingrich deserves credit for using statistics from a credible federal agency, but it’s important to note that methodological difficulties make it hard for anyone, even the FBI, to determine how many gang members there are in the United States. Criminologists express skepticism about whether gang membership could have jumped 40 percent in just two years, saying that broader crime statistics don’t show any sign of it. In addition, despite the Gingrich camp’s insistence that he did not mean to cast blame on Obama for the rise in gang membership, we think that a reasonable viewer of the discussion could have made such an inference. On balance, we rate the claim Half True. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/682949c8-0c99-4bd5-959a-cf2953e8cfce	None	Newt Gingrich	None	None	None	2013-07-24T17:01:45	2013-07-21	['None']
pomt-07243	"Most of your serial killers, most of your people who commit domestic violence, they start off by abusing animals."	false	/rhode-island/statements/2011/may/31/ej-finocchio/rhode-island-society-prevention-cruelty-animals-ch/	The Rhode Island Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals wants the legal system to impose harsher sentences in animal cruelty cases. During a discussion on the issue on WJAR's "10 News Conference," which aired April 24, RISPCA President E.J. Finocchio said animal abusers are allowed to plead "no contest" and make a donation to the court instead of paying a fine, a practice that allows them to escape a formal conviction. It's important to take animal violence seriously, he said. "Animal cruelty and domestic violence go hand in hand," he said. "Most of your serial killers, most of your people who commit domestic violence, they start off by abusing animals, the weakest of our society -- children, elderly, animals, women -- so there is a direct correlation statistically nationwide that animal abuse and domestic violence go hand in hand." We were intrigued by the possibility that animals might be a sort of "gateway victim" for most domestic violence perpetrators or serial killers, or that animal abuse might be a harbinger of murder and domestic violence. When we asked Finocchio for supporting evidence, he sent us the society's winter 2009 newsletter, which mentioned five serial killers and the way they had harmed animals. He also suggested we check a June 2009 study in the Journal of Interpersonal Violence that examined whether animal cruelty is a "red flag" for family violence (more about that later). In addition, we consulted with other experts. The consensus was that there is a link, but it's complicated. "Animal abuse is strongly associated with a whole host of antisocial behavior running from violence against people to parking ticket violations. It lights up the board," said Arnold Arluke, a professor of sociology at Northeastern University. "The study we did compared animal abusers to people who were not animal abusers. The abusers were five times more likely to have a history of violence toward people, four times more likely to commit a property crime and three and a half times more likely to commit a drug-related offense," he said. The problem, he said, is that animal violence "is not really a strong predictor or causal agent [of violence toward people]. There's a lot of people who commit animal abuse who do not go on to commit any other violence." Among those who do, the animal violence is usually "up close and personal" (such as when an animal is strangled), the animal is typically known to the abuser, and there has been more than one instance of abuse. "But," said Arluke, "most cases aren't like that." In his statement, Finocchio talked about "most" serial killers and "most" people who commit domestic violence. Let's consider them separately. SERIAL KILLERS: We contacted Ann Burgess, a professor of psychiatric nursing at Boston College who coauthored the 1988 book "Sexual Homicide: Patterns and Motives." The book is based on interviews with 36 serial murderers. She and her colleagues found that 13 (or 36 percent) had a history of animal cruelty. "So you can't say most," she said, referring to Finocchio's claim. "The FBI did a study of serial killers and they found fewer than 50 percent had a known history of animal abuse. In fact, some were known as the animal lovers in the neighborhood," said Arluke. The idea of a link between animal abuse and serial killers "becomes one of the expressions that people who champion [animal protection] like to throw around. It's smart politics because we don't want more serial killers," he said. "But the minute you start to look at every instance of animal abuse as essentially predictive of every person who's going to be a serial killer, if that were the case, we would have tens of thousands of serial killers, and we don't, thank God." DOMESTIC VIOLENCE PERPETRATORS: Once again, there is good evidence that animal abuse and domestic violence go hand in hand. The question is whether most abusers harmed animals first. Surveys of women seeking help at domestic violence shelters have found that 46 to 71 percent report that their male abuser had harmed or threatened to harm a pet, according to the "Red Flag" study Finocchio referred us to, which was coauthored by Sarah DeGue of the John Jay College of Criminal Justice in New York and David DeLillo of the University of Nebraska, Lincoln. People who engage in domestic violence are known to use pets to intimidate, coerce or control the victimized partner, DeGue and others told us. (In fact, Finocchio's organization serves as a safe haven for the pets of people victimized by domestic violence.) But women who end up in a shelter constitute a very select group. After all, they aren't the only victims of domestic violence. And such studies don't show whether animal abuse came first. DeGue and DeLillo said researchers, advocates and policy makers often assume that there's an overlap between animal abuse and domestic violence (including child mistreatment). Yet "little evidence exists to support this contention." In their study of 860 college students they found that "the majority (73.2 percent) of family violence victims overall did not report any exposure to animal abuse." So only 27 percent of the victims of domestic and/or child abuse had seen or engaged in animal abuse as well. That's far from a majority, even if you assume that, in all these cases, the abuser started off harming animals. "I'm not aware of any reliable research studies that have examined animal abuse perpetration as a precursor to domestic partner violence," said DeGue, now a behavioral scientist in the division of violence prevention at the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. "We actually found a number of cases that were the reverse, where people were first violent toward people and then subsequently became violent toward animals," said Arluke. In short, there IS a link between domestic violence and animal abuse because violent people are, well, violent. If Finocchio had simply stuck with his assertion that "animal cruelty and domestic violence go hand in hand," our ruling would be different. Instead, he made the provocative assertion that there's a progression of violence because "most of your serial killers, most of your people who commit domestic violence, they start off by abusing animals." The experts we consulted -- including one Finocchio sent us to -- said the best evidence shows that a majority of serial killers and domestic assailants do not have a history of animal abuse. The evidence supporting the idea that their first victims are animals is even slimmer. So the judges unanimously ruled that his statement is False. (Get updates from PolitiFactRI on Twitter.

pomt-14948	Because of Obamacare "people’s premiums ... are going up 35, 45, 55 percent."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/oct/25/donald-trump/trump-obamacare-health-care-premiums-going-35-45-5/	Donald Trump won’t apologize to Ben Carson for questioning the neurosurgeon's religion, but he agrees with Carson’s thoughts on health care. Trump, who is trailing Carson in new polls in Iowa, suggested on the campaign trail that Carson’s Seventh-day Adventist faith wasn’t "down the middle of the road." Appearing on ABC’s This Week, Trump said he "didn’t say anything bad" about Carson, called Carson’s proposal for personal health savings accounts a "very good idea," and took the opportunity to knock down a different opponent. "People’s — I don’t know if you have been watching lately over the last couple of weeks — people’s premiums, George, are going up 35, 45, 55 percent," Trump said on Oct. 25. "Their deductibles are so high nobody’s ever going to get to use it. So ... Obamacare is turning out to be a bigger disaster than anybody thought." On average, premiums have risen by about 5.8 percent a year since Obama took office, compared to 13.2 percent in the nine years before Obama. Is it true that we’ll see insurance plans jacked up 35 to 55 percent in 2016? We reached out to the Trump campaign but didn’t hear back. Experts we talked to and the data show that while there are examples of premium increases that large, they’re not the norm. Double digits for some plans Let’s begin with a brief primer on premium hikes. Under the Affordable Care Act, insurers planning to increase their rates by more than 10 percent have to submit their proposals for federal review. In many states, the companies also have to negotiate their prices with a state insurance commissioner. Generally, the finalized premiums will be equal to or lower than the proposed rates, according to Larry Levitt of the Kaiser Family Foundation, a leading nonpartisan health policy research center. With five days left before open enrollment begins on Nov. 1, rates are likely already approved or amended, but not all them have been publicized. Trump has a point that some insurers have requested increases that hit high double digits. "Yes, some people in some plans through some carriers in some states are, indeed, looking at rate hikes of ‘35 to 50 percent’ if they stick with those plans in 2016," said Charles Gaba, who runs the popular blog ACAsignups.net, which tracks Obamacare enrollment. "This is not completely off the wall. Many of the popular plans requested high increases," said Gail Wilensky, a health economist and the head of Medicare and Medicaid under George H.W. Bush. "Those hikes will affect more people than some may think." She pointed out that Blue Cross Blue Shield, a prominent insurer with a significant amount of enrollees, proposed rate hikes of 14 to 38 percent in Illinois and 50 to 65 percent in New Mexico. But that’s not telling the entire story either, according to the data. Much lower average Just 7 percent of all plans in the federal exchange had a proposed rate hike of 30 percent or higher, estimates Agile Health Insurance, which bills itself as "an affordable alternative to Obamacare." That translates to average increases at far lower levels than what Trump said. Looking at finalized rates for the lowest and second-lowest cost marketplace plans in the silver category — which are the basis for federal premium subsidies and chosen by 68 percent of enrollees — the average increase is nowhere near 35 to 55 percent. The Kaiser Family Foundation found that the cost of a benchmark silver plan will be 4.4 percent more expensive on average across major cities in 13 states and Washington, D.C. (Again, that is a smaller annual increase than what had been occurring before Obamacare became law.) According to Kaiser, enrollees in Minneapolis will see the biggest premium increase at 28.7 percent. On the other end of the spectrum, plans will actually decrease by 10.4 percent in Seattle. If we look at both finalized and requested rates across the board, Trump’s figure is still too high. ACASignups.net projects a national weighted average 12 to 13 percent increase across 49 states and Washington, D.C. (there’s no data for Wisconsin). That’s consistent with the Associated Press’ estimates, which project increases in the high single-digits to the low teens. By Gaba’s estimates, just three states are hiking near the level Trump is claiming: Alaska, Hawaii and Minnesota. "I don’t see any plausible way of the average rate hike being anywhere close to 35 percent, and certainly not any higher than that," Gaba said. No such thing as typical All the experts we spoke to warned us that there’s significant variation from plan to plan, from region to region, and from insuree to insuree. That’s why neither Trump’s claim nor averages tell the whole story. The disparity in rate increases are more likely adjustments insurers are making, rather than evidence that Obamacare is a "disaster," as Trump says. After all, 2016 is the first year that insurers are looking at actual claims data instead of "essentially guessing at what their costs were," said Levitt of the Kaiser Foundation. "Some insurers guessed better than others, which leads to variations in premium changes." Enrollment figures are different from state to state, which affects the risk pool and the premium changes. Premium rate increases can also be unique to an individual’s circumstances, not necessarily reflective of a national average. "A number of factors can result in a consumer’s premium differing from the average rate change, including changes in: age, tobacco status, geography, benefit design, family status, and subsidy eligibility," according to a brief by the American Academy of Actuaries. To really get a sense of what the typical rate increase is, we not only have to wait for the final rates to come out but the enrollment figures as well. "You need to have a weighted average so we’ll only know after the fact," Wilensky said. In the meantime, experts recommend everyone check their own rates. Our ruling Trump said, "People’s premiums … are going up 35, 45, 55 percent." Some insurance plans in the federal exchange will see price hikes at the levels that Trump is suggesting. But he’s cherry-picking the high end of premium changes to come. Estimates for the national average are far below Trump’s figures, ranging from 4.4 percent to 13 percent. Trump’s claim is partially accurate but takes things out of context. We rate it Half True.	None	Donald Trump	None	None	None	2015-10-25T18:17:02	2015-10-25	['None']
pomt-00763	Says Rand Paul denied that he "put forward a bill ... to zero out foreign aid and specifically spoke about Israel."	half-true	/punditfact/statements/2015/apr/14/kirsten-powers/powers-paul-denied-he-put-forward-bill-cut-aid-isr/	Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., has acknowledged that he might need to temper his style during interviews. Paul had several testy encounters in his first week as a presidential candidate. But even the most pleasant demeanor in Washington won’t end the questions about policies he pushed for in the past. Speaking on Fox News Sunday on April 12, columnist and former Democratic operative Kirsten Powers said his views on money for Israel are entirely fair game and she focused on his conversation with NBC’s Savannah Guthrie. "She was asking normal questions, and he actually was lying to her," Powers said. "He's put forward a bill basically saying, I'm going to zero out foreign aid and specifically spoke about Israel, and he's acting all self righteous that he's being asked about it." In this fact-check, we look at what Paul said during that NBC interview, and whether Powers is correct in saying Paul denied having a bill that would eliminate foreign aid and directly mentioned Israel. The interview Paul’s session with Guthrie got contentious when she asked him about his policy shifts, especially on Israel. Guthrie: "You have had views on foreign policy that are unorthodox, but you seem to have changed. You said Iran was not a threat and now you say it is. You once proposed ending aid to Israel, and now you support it, at least for the time being. And once offered to drastically cut --" Paul: "Well, before we go, before we go --" Guthrie: "Wait, wait. Once wanted to drastically cut defense spending --" Paul: "Before we go into a litany of --" Guthrie: "-- and now you want to increase it 16 percent. So I just wondered if you mellowed out?" Paul: "Why don’t we let me explain instead of talking over me, okay?" When things settled down, Paul gave this response on Israel. Paul: "My opinion has been we shouldn't borrow money from China to send it to any country. Pakistan, Israel or any other country. But I also realized that things will have to be done gradually and if we are going to try to eliminate or reduce foreign aid, why don’t we start with the countries that hate us or burn our flag. And the one thing that is true is that Israel doesn’t burn our flag. So I haven’t proposed removing aid from Israel, but I still agree --" Guthrie: "But you once did." Paul: "-- with the original precept. Let me answer the question. I agree with my original statement from years ago that ultimately, all nations should be free of foreign aid." A tale of two budget proposals We dug into the question of Paul and money for Israel about a year ago and we can see the two-month period in 2011 when Paul changed his stance. In the Internet Archive’s Wayback Machine, we found a 65-page budget proposal released by Paul’s office in March 2011. Citing a pattern of squandered and unwise spending on foreign governments, the report offered a straightforward bottom line on foreign aid: "Eliminate all international assistance." The section on Israel says this: "While this budget proposal does eliminate foreign aid to Israel, it is not meant to hurt, negate, or single out one of America’s most important allies. This proposal eliminates all foreign aid to all countries. Israel’s ability to conduct foreign policy, regain economic dominance, and support itself without the heavy hand of U.S. interests and policies, will only strengthen the Israeli community. The elimination of all foreign aid, including provisions to Israel, is not necessarily a new idea. In 1996, during an address before the U.S. Congress, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu declared that his nation would eventually wean itself from dependence on U.S. foreign aid. Prominent Israeli politicians and economists alike have called for the end of foreign aid. Among them is economist Amon Gafney, who served as governor of the Bank of Israel from 1970 to 1981. He pointed out that foreign aid has caused Israel to suffer from ―Dutch Disease, a situation in which a generous gift brings short-term benefits but impairs a country’s long-term competitiveness." This was not some trial balloon. Paul put his plan into writing within weeks of arriving at the Senate in January 2011, and he defended his position to eliminate aid to Israel in at least four separate interviews: On Jan. 26, 2011, on CNN, Feb. 3, 2011, with ABC, Feb. 8, 2011, on Fox News and in an interview with Slate, published Feb. 18, 2011. Paul was well aware that his view was unpopular. He told several interviewers that out of the $500 billion budget reduction he proposed, he was hearing the most complaints about the money for Israel. "The cuts to that one particular country were three-fifths of 1 percent of it," he told ABC. Later, he said on Fox News, "I support Israel as our greatest ally in the Middle East, but at the same time, we can't give them money that we don't have." You won’t find that proposal on Paul’s official website. By May 2011, Paul had a new budget plan, which we also found via the Internet Archive. Here are the title pages of both. The new proposal scrapped the section on Israel in its entirety. Indeed, Israel isn’t mentioned anywhere in the 65-page document. Also, Paul’s new bottom line for foreign aid wasn’t to cut it to zero. Rather, the proposal said, "Freeze foreign aid funding at $5 billion." Though the report doesn’t say so explicitly, that would have been enough to cover the outlays for Israel. That plan was the one that came up for a vote in the Senate where it was rejected 90-7. Paul has since said that he favors continuing aid for Israel. The problem with Powers’ statement is that she said Paul had "put forward a bill" that cut all aid to Israel. The language there is sloppy. Paul put forward a concurrent resolution which is a way to capture the sense of the senators. Unlike a bill, if passed, such a resolution would never go before the president and would not have the force of law. Also, Paul changed his budget plan before he submitted it as a resolution. Powers told PunditFact that she was thinking of Paul’s first proposal and "used the wrong terminology." "I don't know why I said bill when I knew it was a proposed budget plan," Powers said. Our ruling Powers said that Paul denied having a bill that would cut all foreign aid and specifically mentioned Israel. In Paul’s NBC interview, he said he hadn’t proposed removing aid from Israel. Actually, Paul put forward a budget proposal that cut aid to Israel and stood by it for at least three months before quietly dropping the idea. The concurrent resolution that Paul proposed and that the Senate voted on did not cut aid to Israel. Powers is correct that Paul denied his effort to cut aid to Israel but she mischaracterized the form of his proposal. We rate the claim Half True.

pomt-02775	Even after collective bargaining reforms, most Wisconsin public employees "are still paying about 12 to 13 percent" of their health insurance premiums, while most state residents who work in the private sector "pay 20 to 25 percent."	mostly true	/wisconsin/statements/2013/dec/09/scott-walker/most-public-employees-wisconsin-now-pay-12-13-thei/	Less than a month after his inauguration in January 2011, Gov. Scott Walker drew a bead on state employees and what they pay toward their health insurance premiums. Even if what most of the workers paid were doubled, Walker said in his first "state of the state" speech, they would still only being paying half the national average. We rated that claim True. State workers were paying about 6 percent of their premiums, so doubling would put that at 12 percent; meanwhile, the national average -- for public and private employees -- was 29 percent. Nearly three years later, the Republican governor, on a higher platform as an author and potential presidential candidate, made a similar assertion. In a Nov. 27, 2013 interview on Wisconsin Public Radio about his new book, Walker reflected on Act 10, the law that made most state -- as well as local -- government employees pay more for benefits. It also erased most of their collective bargaining powers. "In the end, do public employees -- including me and my family -- pay a little bit more for pensions and health care? Absolutely," Walker told host Joy Cardin. "But still far less than what our counterparts pay outside of government. Most people in this state pay 20 to 25 percent, for example, of their health insurance. Most of our public employees are still paying about 12 to 13 percent." Let’s hit the ledgers again. Act 10 and state workers When we contacted Walker spokesman Tom Evenson about Walker’s new claim, he insisted that when the governor said public employes, he was referring only to state employees; Evenson also said "state employees" and "public employees" are synonymous. But that certainly would not have been clear to listeners. In the radio interview, Walker referred twice in quick succession to public employees, which would include not only state workers -- who number about 70,000 -- but some 200,000 local government and school employees, as well. Indeed, Act 10, the focus of Walker’s remarks, applies to that much larger group of public employees (except for police and firefighters, who were exempted from the law). Walker signed the innocuously labeled budget-repair bill, known formally as Act 10, in March 2011, after unprecedented protests in and around the state Capitol. The law did double, from 6 percent to 12 percent, what the vast majority of state employees pay toward health insurance premiums. That also applies to nearly 13,000 local government workers who get health insurance through the state. But Act 10 does not determine how much the vast majority of local public employees pay toward their premiums. Other public workers Local schools employ 99,000 full-time-equivalent employees statewide. Before Act 10, school workers who got health insurance through school districts paid an average of 4 percent to 5 percent of their premiums, according to school districts responding to a 2010-’11 survey by the Wisconsin Association of School Boards. Now, the average is 10 percent. The association’s data is by district and isn’t broken down to indicate what percentage most school employees pay. But the average figure show goes to Walker’s point that school employees are paying significantly less than private-sector workers. There are no such surveys for employees of cities, villages, towns and counties. Dan Thompson, executive director of the League of Wisconsin Municipalities, said Walker’s claim of 12 percent to 13 percent might be a little high, but is a reasonable estimate as an average of what city and village employees around the state pay toward their premiums. So, that figure also helps Walker make his case. The municipalities group had no hard number. Nor did the Wisconsin Counties Association or the Wisconsin Towns Association. So, Walker’s figure of 12 percent to 13 percent is accurate for state employees and a significant number of other public employees are paying that rate or less. Private sector As for the second part of Walker’s claim, Walker’s spokesman pointed us to 2012 figures from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services for Wisconsin residents working in the private sector. They show employees paid 22 percent of the cost of the health insurance premiums for single coverage and 24 percent for family coverage. We posed Walker’s claim to Dave Jensen, editorial director of HCTrends, a Milwaukee health care research organization. He cited the same federal figures, known as the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey. Jensen pointed out that the federal figures include public- as well as private-sector employees. But he said the proportion of public employees is so small that the federal figures still provide a solid estimate of how much private-sector employees are paying for health insurance. Our rating Walker said that even after his collective bargaining reforms, most Wisconsin public employees "are still paying about 12 to 13 percent" of their health insurance premiums, while most state residents who work in the private sector "pay 20 to 25 percent." The available figures indicate many if not most public employees are paying at or less than 12 percent and Walker was right on the private-sector workers part of his claim. We rate his statement Mostly True. To comment on this item, go to the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel website.	None	Scott Walker	None	None	None	2013-12-09T05:00:00	2013-11-27	['Wisconsin']
pomt-03682	The election bill "allows persons to correct an absentee ballot if they did not sign it and requires an extra two hours a day for early voting. Everything else in this bill is discretionary."	half-true	/florida/statements/2013/apr/23/christopher-l-smith/chris-smith-elections-bill-two-required-changes/	Florida lawmakers are poised to pass voting law changes after being mocked for long lines and delayed results during the 2012 presidential election. But in the waning days of the legislative session, Senate Democrats are criticizing the plan as not going far enough to address the problems at the polls last year. "This bill mandates only two things that will address concerns from the last election," wrote Sen. Chris Smith, the Senate Democratic leader from Fort Lauderdale, in a column in the Sun-Sentinel April 21. "It allows persons to correct an absentee ballot if they did not sign it and requires an extra two hours a day for early voting. Everything else in this bill is discretionary. Under SB 600, Broward, Dade, Palm Beach, Duval, Orange, Hillsborough, Jackson, Franklin, Dixie and all the rest of our 67 counties can do exactly what they did in 2012, with the exception of just two more hours per day for early voting. Nothing else is mandated. Nothing else is changed." The column left readers with the impression that the bill changed little for the better. Smith called it "an opportunity lost." Democrats and Republicans are split on some provisions of the bill, so there are varying perspectives as to what "concerns" came up after the last election. We wanted to fact-check Smith’s claim that the election bill "allows persons to correct an absentee ballot if they did not sign it and requires an extra two hours a day for early voting. Everything else in this bill is discretionary." Inside the elections bills First, some quick history. In 2011, the GOP-dominated Legislature passed an elections law that reduced the amount of days for early voting from 14 to eight. The new law gave supervisors a choice of offering between between six and 12 hours of early voting each day. So local elections supervisors had the choice to offer between 48 hours and 96 hours of early voting over eight days. Gov. Rick Scott signed the 2011 elections bill but distanced himself from it after Florida’s 2012 election drew national ridicule. Scott announced his own recommendations for reform that echoed proposals from the state elections supervisors association. On April 16, the Florida Senate reworked the House elections bill, HB 7013. The Senate is scheduled to take a final vote on its version of the bill on April 24, after which it will go back to the House. We read the bill and interviewed elections officials, lawmakers involved in crafting the bill and Senate staff to analyze what the bill will and won’t do. Let’s look at the two changes Smith mentioned. Absentee ballot signatures: The bill gives voters a second chance if they forgot to sign their absentee ballot. The bill says they would have until 5 p.m. the Sunday before Election Day to correct it. Adds early voting hours: Currently, the law for early voting requires eight days and between six to 12 hours a day for a combined 48 to 96 hours. The proposed law would create between 64 hours (eight days, 8 hours each) and 168 hours (14 days, 12 hours each) at the discretion of elections supervisors. Smith said the law would mandate an extra two hours a day of early voting. That’s true -- counties that had six hours would now have to increase it to at least eight. Still, Smith wants elections supervisors to offer 168 hours, even though many said that would be too demanding and unnecessary, especially in smaller counties and primary elections. Smith wants voters in all counties to have the same access to the polls. "I dont give a damn. This is voting. This is a fundamental right," Smith told PolitiFact Florida. "This is what people have died in the streets for, this is what people are dying overseas for. Just because an elected official doesn't want to do their job, maybe they shouldn't be supervisor of elections." The elections supervisors’ association wrote a letter endorsing SB 600 as "an excellent election reform bill." The association had two top priorities of equal weight: reducing the ballot length and expanding options for early voting sites and hours. Smith’s claim that the bill only mandates an extra two hours a day of early voting is factually correct, but it doesn’t tell the whole story, said Brian Corley, Pasco County’s elections supervisor and leader of the association’s legislative affairs this year. (Corley is a Republican; his association includes supervisors from both parties.) The association was not seeking a one-size-fits-all mandate to expand hours because large counties may need more hours than smaller counties, he said. "Do you think (Palm Beach supervisor Susan) Bucher or (Broward supervisor Brenda) Snipes in Broward for a major presidential or gubernatorial election is really going to have 64 hours?" he said. "The answer is obviously no." Let’s look at some of the other provisions that would change in election law: Early voting sites: The bill says supervisors "may" offer early voting at fairgrounds, civic centers, courthouses, community centers and stadiums. The supervisors don’t have to offer early voting at these places, so it’s not a mandate. Current law allows for early voting only at libraries, city halls and elections offices. Election preparation report: Every supervisor must submit a report three months before Election Day about staffing and equipment. Declaring elections supervisors noncompliant: The Senate added a controversial amendment that allows the state to place elections supervisors in "noncompliant status" if they miss deadlines or violate election rules. Sen. Miguel Diaz de la Portilla, R-Miami, sponsored that amendment, which appears to be aimed at counties deemed "underperforming" in the 2012 election by the state including Miami-Dade and Broward. Supervisors declared noncompliant would lose their "special qualification salary" -- the extra $2,000 supervisors can earn if they meet certain criteria. Most of a supervisor’s salary is based on a population formula. About half of the supervisors are currently eligible to receive the $2,000. Voter assistance/ballot brokering: One of the more contentious additions to the bill limits the number of voters a volunteer can assist in an election to 10 people. Further, the voter must know the person assisting him or her before casting a ballot. The bill also limits the number of absentee ballots that paid campaign workers and other solicitors can accept for nonfamily members to two. Voter rights groups attacked the changes as disenfranchising the elderly, disabled voters and non-English speakers. The proposal follows an election in which paid ballot brokers in Miami-Dade, known as boleteros, were arrested. Length of ballot items: Republicans included a 75-word limit on ballot summaries of proposed constitutional amendments that come from the Legislature. Supervisors are pleased this language is in the proposed overhaul. Democrats are displeased because the 75-word limit disappears if the Florida Supreme Court rejects the wording of the ballot summary. Democrats wanted an amendment that limited the summaries to 75 words on all attempts, but Republicans said no. Corley is not worried. He said, "Could there be a scenario where the Attorney General goes above 75 words in a rewrite? Sure it could, logistically. But I don’t see 650 words." Sunday voting: Smith’s column doesn’t mention that the bill would allow voting on the Sunday before Election Day, known as "Souls to the Polls" drives in some black communities. Current law bans early voting on that Sunday. Before the 2011 law, supervisors could offer an aggregate of eight hours for early voting on the Saturday and Sunday before the election. Just 10 of 67 counties offered voting on Sunday in the 2010 general election for no more than four hours, including Pinellas and Miami-Dade. The new proposal allows -- but doesn’t mandate -- eight to 12 hours of early voting on this Sunday. The law contains other mandates for supervisors, including requiring them to notify electors the reason their absentee ballot was rejected and to upload early voting and absentee ballots the day before Election Day (but not publicly post it). Smith told PolitiFact Florida in an interview that his comment referred to "things that affect voters and their time in line." He called the measures that affect supervisors and canvassing boards "inside baseball." Our ruling Smith wrote that the election bill "allows persons to correct an absentee ballot if they did not sign it and requires an extra two hours a day for early voting. Everything else in this bill is discretionary." The bill does mandate those two changes. But Smith omits that some of those discretionary changes in the bill are a big deal and are expected to change how elections are operated in large counties. Elections supervisors in at least some counties are likely to restore early voting on the Sunday before Election Day and they are likely to add more early voting sites and go beyond the mandated minimum hours. Plus, we found a few provisions that are not discretionary and would affect voters. We rate Smith’s claim Half True.	None	Christopher L. Smith	None	None	None	2013-04-23T18:16:04	2013-04-21	['None']
pomt-09256	Late changes to the Arizona immigration law "lay to rest questions over the possibility of racial profiling."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/may/04/jan-brewer/arizona-immigration-law-rewrite-lays-rest-worries-/	The controversy over a hard-line immigration law signed by Republican Arizona Gov. Jan Brewer on April 23, 2010, shows no signs of ebbing, despite a last-minute change to the law's language designed to placate some of the laws' critics. Generally speaking, the law, which would go into effect in 90 days, makes being an illegal immigrant a state crime and requires legal immigrants to carry papers that confirm their legal status. One of the key questions to emerge during and after its passage has been what standard law enforcement officers will need to use before questioning individuals about their immigration status. Drawing special attention is the role played by "racial profiling" -- that is, the use of racial or ethnic characteristics as a justification for police questioning. Critics had said that the original version of the law permitted racial profiling. But the changes signed by Brewer on April 30 were intended to blunt those charges. The new version of the law says: "A law enforcement official or agency of this state or a county, city, town or other political subdivision of this state may not consider race, color or national origin in implementing the requirements of this subsection except to the extent permitted by the United States or Arizona Constitution." The prior version had said that an official "may not solely consider race" in such circumstances. The change appears to limit the scope of the law. The previous wording left open the possibility that race could be used as a factor -- just not the sole factor -- in deciding to stop someone. In a news release issued after signing the changes to the law, Brewer said, "These changes specifically answer legal questions raised by some who expressed fears that the original law would somehow allow or lead to racial profiling. These new amendments make it crystal clear and undeniable that racial profiling is illegal, and will not be tolerated in Arizona. I am proud that the Arizona Legislature has listened carefully to everyone’s concerns, and, in a gesture of statesmanship, acted swiftly and appropriately to lay to rest questions over the possibility of racial profiling." We wanted to judge the accuracy of Brewer's statement that the new wording will "lay to rest questions over the possibility of racial profiling." This is our second attempt in a week to analyze the Arizona law. We first addressed the law in a pair of rulings on April 28, 2010, before the most recent changes were made. We'll now attempt another pair of rulings -- this one on the question of racial profiling, and a separate item on whether police need to suspect or witness something illegal before proceeding to ask someone about their immigration status. While the new phrasing on racial profiling seems straightforward -- and while the new language will provide opponents of racial profiling a useful weapon in court -- legal experts we spoke to said that it's not "crystal clear and undeniable" that racial profiling will be impossible under the law. Rather, the Arizona law, even in its revised version, sets up a clash of constitutional principles that could be fought over in the courts for years to come. Indeed, the law almost demands court involvement by expressly authorizing police to consider race "to the extent permitted by the United States or Arizona Constitution" -- something that is far from nailed down. A big reason for uncertainty is that there is Supreme Court precedent for allowing racial profiling under similar circumstances to those envisioned in the Arizona law. In 1975, the U.S. Supreme Court decided a case called United States vs. Brignoni-Ponce. In that case, a roving unit of the U.S. Border Patrol stopped a vehicle near the Mexican border and questioned the occupants about their immigration status. In this case, the court wrote, "the only ground for suspicion is that the occupants appear to be of Mexican ancestry." In a 9-0 decision, the court ruled that "because of the important governmental interest in preventing the illegal entry of aliens at the border, the minimal intrusion of a brief stop, and the absence of practical alternatives for policing the border, an officer, whose observations lead him reasonably to suspect that a particular vehicle may contain aliens who are illegally in the country, may stop the car briefly, question the driver and passengers about their citizenship and immigration status, and ask them to explain suspicious circumstances; but any further detention or search must be based on consent or probable cause." In the majority opinion, Justice Lewis Powell continued, "The likelihood that any given person of Mexican ancestry is an alien is high enough to make Mexican appearance a relevant factor," even though "standing alone it does not justify stopping all Mexican-Americans to ask if they are aliens." In other words, racial factors can be legitimately used in profiling, just as long as they are not the only factors -- language that's similar to the Arizona law's original wording. Complicating matters further, the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals -- the federal court that includes Arizona -- has issued a more restrictive ruling than the Supreme Court on the use of race in profiling. Unlike the Supreme Court, the 9th Circuit ruled that consideration of Hispanic appearance in a stop is impermissible, said Jennifer Chacon, law professor at the University of California-Irvine. This tracks closely the new language added to the law. Legal experts we spoke to said that, at a minimum, this difference of opinion sets up a judicial conflict that needs to be sorted out. In the meantime, even if racial profiling is officially banned, the new Arizona law continues to permit non-racially based profiling, such as profiling based on clothing or behavior. Yet many legal experts we spoke to saw a hazy, and perhaps unenforceable, line between permissible profiles and illegal ones. Kevin Johnson, dean of the law school at the University of California-Davis and a specialist on immigration law, said he worries that local police inadequately trained in immigration law could engage in profiling, either unwittingly or intentionally. "My fear is that, with the new addition to the law or not, racial profiling will result, with untrained local law enforcement officers – perhaps unconsciously – relying on racial and/or class stereotypes" when determining whether there's "reasonable suspicion" about one's immigration status. For defendants who feel they were stopped unfairly due to racial profiling, "it may be virtually impossible to show, at least for many months if not several years" that the police made their decision illegally on racial or ethnic grounds, said Stephen Saltzburg, a law professor at George Washington University. Brewer's office did not respond to a request for comment. Ultimately, the late changes do bolster Brewer's contention that the law prohibits racial profiling. But our legal experts say that it is far from the done deal that she suggests. There are simply too many legal loose ends to be settled in court to be able to say that the late changes to the law will "lay to rest questions over the possibility of racial profiling," as Brewer put it. We rule Brewer's statement Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.

pomt-01617	In 2012, there were nearly 12.2 million arrests and only 410 "uses of deadly force" by police in the United States.	mostly true	/wisconsin/statements/2014/aug/29/edward-flynn/fatal-police-shootings-occur-tiny-percentage-arres/	In the wake of the fatal police shooting in Ferguson, Mo., Milwaukee Police Chief Edward Flynn was interviewed for nearly an hour on Wisconsin Public Radio about the incident and its implications. At one point during the Aug. 20, 2014 interview, Flynn told host Kathleen Dunn "there are many reasons why (police) uses of force are dramatically down, and the main one is training." Then, alluding back to Ferguson, the chief added: "It's an extraordinarily rare event. But the fact is, (in) 2012, there were 12,197,000 arrests in the United States, OK? And there were 410 uses of deadly force. Now that is, I think, three-thousands of a percent. So, it’s still an extraordinarily rare event." In the comparison Flynn uses, there is one police killing in 0.00003 percent of all arrests -- an even tinier fraction than he suggested. But expressed another way, the 410 is an average of more than one police killing per day. So, what about the two figures themselves: Are they accurate and do they account for all of the people who are killed by police? Renewed focus Around the country, attention to the use of deadly force by police was heightened after Michael Brown, an unarmed 18-year-old, was shot to death on Aug. 9, 2014, in Ferguson, a St. Louis suburb. In Milwaukee, residents held rallies to raise questions about the Brown case and about the April 2014 death of Dontre Hamilton, a 31-year-old who was shot multiple times by a police officer during a struggle in Red Arrow Park in downtown Milwaukee. (In Milwaukee, there was one police killing of a citizen in 2012, four in 2013 and two through late August of 2014, the Police Department told us.) PolitiFact National rated Half True a claim by conservative talk show host Michael Medved that "more whites than blacks are victims of deadly police shootings." The claim ignored the fact that there are more than five times more whites than blacks in America. And our colleagues rated as False a statement that an unarmed black person is shot by a police officer every 28 hours. The report that had been cited by CNN pundit Marc Lamont Hill looked at all deaths, not just those of unarmed individuals. And it rolled in some deaths that did not involve police officers. Flynn’s claim Flynn, who headed the police departments in Arlington, Va., and Springfield, Mass., before becoming Milwaukee’s chief in 2008, is known nationally for his use of data. When we asked for evidence for Flynn’s claim, a Milwaukee police spokesman cited two FBI reports. Both are from 2012, the most recent full-year statistics available. There were 12,196,959 arrests across the country in 2012, which means the figure Flynn used -- 12,197,000 -- was rounded up only slightly. The highest numbers of those arrests were for drug abuse violations, driving under the influence and larceny-theft. There were also 410 cases of justifiable homicide in 2012, according to the FBI, which defines justifiable homicide as the killing of a felon by a law enforcement officer in the line of duty. For example: A police officer responding to a bank robbery alarm who shot a suspect after the suspect fired at the officer. But that doesn’t taken into account all police killings of citizens. FiveThirtyEight.com, a news website devoted to data analysis, recently reported that the 410 is a minimum figure. The numbers are self-reported by local police agencies and not audited, not all police agencies report those figures to the FBI and the number doesn’t include homicides that weren’t ruled justifiable. The FBI totals are likely an undercount for another reason, criminologists told us. Researchers who examine police killings of citizens within large metropolitan police departments often find that the number of such incidents recorded by the departments are higher than the number of justifiable homicides reported by the FBI. But the criminologists also noted Flynn’s comparison is one legitimate way to measure the frequency of police killings. Our rating Flynn said that in 2012, there were nearly 12.2 million arrests and "410 uses of deadly force" by police in the United States. The Milwaukee police chief correctly quotes official FBI statistics on arrests and justifiable homicides by law enforcement officers, although it appears the 410 is an undercount of the number of people killed by police. We rate his statement Mostly True. To comment on this item, go to the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel website.	None	Edward Flynn	None	None	None	2014-08-29T05:00:00	2014-08-20	['United_States']
pomt-05978	"When I was speaker, we had four consecutive balanced budgets."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/jan/23/newt-gingrich/newt-gingrich-repeats-claim-he-balanced-federal-bu/	During the Jan. 23, 2012, Republican presidential debate in Tampa, Newt Gingrich repeated a claim he’s made about his record in balancing the budget as House speaker. "When I was speaker, we had four consecutive balanced budgets, the only time in your lifetime, Brian, that we've had four consecutive balanced budgets," Gingrich said. "Most people think that's good." We’ve checked this -- such as during the Dec. 15, 2011, Republican presidential debate in Sioux City, Iowa -- and never found it to be accurate. Gingrich was speaker from January 1995 to January 1999, when he was a Republican congressman from Atlanta’s suburbs. The federal budget runs on a fiscal year calendar that begins October 1 and ends September 30. During fiscal years 1996 and 1997 -- the first two that Gingrich helped shape as speaker -- there were deficits: $107 billion in 1996 and about $22 billion in 1997. By fiscal year 1998, the federal budget did reach a surplus of $69 billion. And in fiscal year 1999 -- which Gingrich can claim some responsibility for, even though he was out as speaker for most of the fiscal year -- it was in surplus as well, to the tune of $126 billion. But that’s only two balanced budgets he can plausibly claim credit for. The federal government did run four consecutive surpluses, but for the last two of those -- fiscal years 2000 and 2001 -- Gingrich was no longer serving in the House. It’s also worth noting that even the two balanced budgets for which Gingrich can claim some credit were collective accomplishments by a Democratic president, Bill Clinton, and the Republican-controlled U.S. Senate. Our ruling Gingrich was off-base with this claim -- again. The budget was indeed balanced for four years, but it’s a stretch for him to take credit for anything more than two of those years. We rate Gingrich’s claim False. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/638b4582-eb6f-4e7e-b410-2bfdee9e7dd5	None	Newt Gingrich	None	None	None	2012-01-23T21:58:15	2012-01-23	['None']
